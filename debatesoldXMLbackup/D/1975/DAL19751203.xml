      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The House has already approved of an original Estimate of £177,022,000, a Supplementary Estimate of £414,000 in respect of financial and other assistance for thalidomide children, and a further Supplementary Estimate of £36,725,000 in respect of a range of pay and price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When moving the latter Estimate in the House last week I mentioned that if the House agreed I would provide an opportunity for Deputies to debate the general hospital development plan and that I would for that purpose arrange for the introduction of a token supplementary of £10.  This is the basis for the present motion. There has been a full debate already, earlier this year, on the general Health Estimate and no doubt I can look forward to a very full debate when the 1976 Estimates come to be moved. For this reason I intend devoting all of my speech today to the national <Col N="677" /> hospital plan.  In doing this, I think I will be meeting the wishes of Deputies, while accepting at the same time that the debate can be as free ranging as Deputies wish and as the Ceann Comhairle rules.  I shall of course be happy in my reply to deal with matters other than the national hospital plan which arises in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>When I assumed office as Minister for Health two-and-a-half years ago there was no plan available for the ordered development of the general hospital system in the country. The last general hospital plan covering the whole of the country was determined some 30 to 40 years previously.  This was concerned with the planning and construction of county hospitals or the adaptation of other institutions into county hospitals, which have been the basis of the hospital system since then.  I am conscious that, since that period, on the local authority side there have been a number of regional hospitals built or adapted to meet particular needs in particular areas, but there was a total lack of a co-ordinated plan on which hospital development for the future could be based.  On the voluntary hospital side there had also been no long-term, co-ordinated plan for their development, even though the Hospitals Commission did good work of co-ordination at a lower level.</P>
    <P>It is true that a real effort was made to devise such a plan with the establishment of the Consultative Council on the General Hospital Service in 1967, under the distinguished chairmanship of Professor Fitzgerald.  There is much valuable material in the report which that council produced, not least of which was the emphasis which they placed on the urgent need for a plan such as I have described.  It is an appalling indictment of our hospital services that this distinguished council could write in the following terms:</P>
    <P>In their present from few of our general hospitals are in a position to give this service.  Fewer still, if any, are in a position to cope with the coming advances.  As we have <Col N="678" /> pointed out in earlier paragraphs, our hospitals are too many, too small and too independent of each other.  The available resources are too thinly spread...</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that the present structure of our hospital organisation is out-moded and is now a hindrance to good medicine, good teaching and economic operation. We believe that if it is to be adapted to meet fully the requirements of modern medicine this can be achieved only by radical changes involving a departure from many long established concepts in regard to organisation, staffing and operation of hospitals.</P>
    <P>These criticisms, written by consultants expert in the field of hospital care and, so far as I am aware, not seriously challenged as to their accuracy and relevance, represented for me on my taking office as Minister for Health probably my greatest single challenge.  The Fitzgerald Report, in its detailed recommendations, created controversy and had defects, and was not found generally acceptable, but its message of the urgent need to improve our hospital services and to make the plans on which a good hospital system could be based was a task which I knew had to be tackled during my period of office.</P>
    <P>I have drawn up a plan.  Decisions have been taken, decisions have been announced, and those decisions will be implemented.  May I suggest that this situation is incomparably better than the policy of drift and indecision which was so severely criticised in the Fitzgerald Report and which continued right up to the day I took office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey in the motion now on the Order Paper invites Dáil Éireann to condemn the national hospital plan as unsuitable and inadequate. I do not agree with him on this, of course, and I will be interested to hear whatever criticisms of the plan he may have.  But I would point out to him that I have taken decisions which previous Administrations avoided.  Even though everyone accepted the need for a hospital plan for the last 20 years or more <Col N="679" /> sive Administrations avoided the complex decisions required.  I took those decisions within two-and-a-half years of taking office and I believe that I took the right decisions.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this debate, I want to describe to the House in broad outline, the steps which I took to ensure that the hospital plan which would be evolved would receive the kind of consideration which an issue of this importance deserved; that a decision would be taken as quickly as possible having regard to the complexities, importance and cost of the service; and that not alone would the resultant plan be both suitable and adequate, but it would be the best possible plan that could be devised. Consideration of, and decisions about, the new hospital plan were divided into two parts&mdash;first, the situation in Dublin and secondly, the situation in the remainder of the country.</P>
    <P>Taking Dublin first, the Government announced their decisions about the new general hospital plan for Dublin about 12 months ago.  This followed the presentation of a special report by Comhairle na nOspidéal, and I would like to pay a special tribute to that body for their work; not alone in relation to the formulation of proposals for the Dublin area, but for the work they carried out in relation to the rest of the country. Their's was an impressive involvement in what was a complicated exercise and, for the magnificent contribution which the comhairle have made in this area, I would like to express publicly my gratitude.</P>
    <P>The Dublin decisions, it will be recalled, were to have three major general hospitals on the north side of Dublin city&mdash;that is the Mater Hospital, the James Connolly Memorial Hospital and a new hospital which, it is proposed, should be located at Beaumont.  Provision was also made for three similar hospitals on the south side of the city&mdash;that is St. James's Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, and a new hospital in the vicinity of Newlands Cross.  I think it is fair to say that this decision was generally welcomed.  The Dublin plan was <Col N="680" /> widely regarded as both suitable and adequate, as meeting the needs of the area, and indeed the wider needs of the country, in so far as certain major specialties are concerned.  I have every reason to expect, therefore, that, when the Dublin plan is implemented, we will provide a first-class hospital service for the Eastern Health Board area for the future.</P>
    <P>Since this decision was announced 12 months ago, consultations have taken place with the authorities of all the major hospitals in the city.  A joint working group representing the comhairle, and including officers of my Department, were set up subsequently to prepare a consultation document indicating the factual situation regarding specialist departments in each of the acute hospitals in Dublin, the general strategy which should be adopted on the future development of specialist departments in the six centres already mentioned, and indicating the various options in relation to the allocation of specialist departments between those centres. The working group were also asked to advise on the role of the existing specialist hospitals and their relationship to the main hospital centres proposed.</P>
    <P>This committee have been working for some months now and, when I have received and considered their report, I intend to consult the interests concerned inviting their views about the report, so that, hopefully, the end result will be a blueprint of the type of development which should take place in each of the six centres which I have already mentioned.  This is an essential prerequisite to realistic planning. In the meantime, however, pending the outcome of the deliberations of the working party, a project team, comprising representatives of St. James's Hospital Board, the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals, inculding members of the professional staff, and my Department, have been established to take the St. James's Hospital development further along the road.  Deputies know there is a long standing commitment to the provision of extra new beds at that institution and, in fact, the Government <Col N="681" /> afforded the St. James's development a priority rating.</P>
    <P>In addition, in so far as the proposed new hospital at Beaumont is concerned, I have already informed the Dáil, in reply to a recent parliamentary question, that negotiations are in progress to obtain a site of about 35 acres at Beaumont Convalescent Home.  The owners, the Sisters of Mercy, have agreed in principle to the acquisition of this site and discussions are proceeding with Dublin Corporation on town planning and service matters.  Possible sites for the new hospital in south-west Dublin are also being explored.</P>
    <P>I think that any fair minded person will agree, that the reaching of a decision on the Dublin hospital service of the future, and the steps which I have outlined which have already been taken since that decision was announced, represent a real advance in a comparatively short space of time.  The Dublin hospital service is of particular importance to the people in the Eastern Health Board but, because of the degree to which major specialties are centralised in the capital and because of the association with and benefit from the medical schools in the city, it is of importance to the rest of the country also.</P>
    <P>In so far as the rest of the country is concerned, Deputies will be aware that I announced, on the 21st October, 1975, details of the general hospital development plan for the areas outside of Dublin.  In a 20 page document I set out the general considerations which I had in mind in approaching this task.  I explained how wide-ranging consultations took place, and, area by area, I gave the existing factual position as regards hospital services.  I outlined the solutions put forward by the working groups which worked in each area, the action taken by me in receiving deputations, the recommendations of the various health administrative bodies, and, finally, my conclusions and the reasons for them.</P>
    <P>I have provided a full and frank exposition, in that document, of the events leading up to the decisions and of the decisions themselves, and of the <Col N="682" /> views of all the bodies, whether they were in accord with my decisions or whether they took a different line.  I deliberately decided on this type of comprehensive exposition in an effort to inform the public in the frankest possible way and to put on record, in a readily available form, all the factors, pro and con, which influenced my decision.  While I do not wish to go over all the details of that long document, there are some points I would like to make, while some recapitulation of the general theme is, I think, appropriate at this point.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that at my request, Comhairle na nOspidéal produced guidelines for the development of hospital services for the future in September, 1973.  These guidelines set out standards for the general hospital of the future, and were of cardinal importance in the determination of subsequent policy.  They provided that:</P>
    <P>(1)  The general aim should be to organise acute hospital services so that the population served would be within a radius of 30 miles of the hospital centre;</P>
    <P>(2)  the minimum staffing of such an acute hospital would consist of two consultant surgeons, two consultant physicians, two consultant anaesthetists, two consultant radiologists, one consultant pathologist, one biochemist and depending on caseload, two consultant obstetrician/gynaecologists and one consultant paediatrician.</P>
    <P>(3)  A minimum scale consultant staffed hospital, conforming to the guidelines, should usually serve a population of around 100,000 but, where there were special considerations, such as low population density, a lower figure would be appropriate, ranging down to 75,000 persons in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>These guidelines were not drawn up by me as Minister for Health, but by Comhairle na nOspidéal at my request. Comhairle na nOspidéal comprises a majority of medical experts and it was their guidelines which were used as the basis of my subsequent <Col N="683" /> decisions.  I would like to emphasise this fact and to say also that I adhered to these guidelines in all but two cases. In these cases, due to planning uncertainties which I shall describe later and, just as importantly, due to recommendations made by the health boards concerned, I felt it prudent to move away to some degree from the basic guidelines.  This happened in the cases of Mallow and Nenagh, for reasons I will describe, and I was pleased to note that Deputy Haughey agreed with me on both these decisions.</P>
    <P>In all other cases, the guidelines were adhered to by health boards and I should say that, in all the consultations which followed the introduction of these guidelines, they were not seriously questioned by anybody to my knowledge.  The comhairle, in putting forward the guidelines, emphasised the shortcomings of the present hospital system and argued strongly the need to organise the general hospital service on a broader medical and technological basis.</P>
    <P>I quote what they said, from the introduction to the guidelines:</P>
    <P>Developments in the practice of medicine in hospitals, particularly since the second world war, have laid increasing emphasis on the contribution of laboratory, radiological and other scientific investigation to patient care and, in addition, have called for the involvement of a number of clinical consultants in dealing with difficult problems of complex disease and injury.  The general move in the direction of a shorter working week has also been felt in the hospital service and there is wide recognition of the importance of avoiding the dangerous effects of fatigue on the quality of work of people whose duties involve sustained concentration.</P>
    <P>All of these developments, coupled with the beneficial tendency towards a greater degree of specialisation by consultants, have pointed towards the need for the <Col N="684" /> organisation of general hospital services on a broader medical and technological base within the hospital and an enlarged population catchment related to the increased capability of the larger hospital.  In short, the idea of a single-handed surgeon or physician attempting to provide a twenty-four hour service with the assistance of supporting medical staff and less than adequate laboratory and radiological services is no longer acceptable from the point of view of the patient's best interests.</P>
    <P>The Comhairle would, therefore, like to stress the importance, for achieving a high standard of patient care, of ensuring that in as many situations as possible, a fully satisfactory hospital organisation is provided. Large hospital centres would be highly desirable in situations where the population would justify this.  However, the Comhairle, recognising the twin difficulties of mountainous terrain and sparse population in parts of the country, acknowledges the appropriateness of smaller hospitals to cater for such situations.  They would emphasise that such smaller hospital should be within a reasonable distance of a larger hospital centre where some of the more specialised facilities would be available.  (Limerick Regional Hospital is an example of the scale of such a larger hospital). This should permit patient care problems of special difficulty to be handled on a joint resource basis and should encourage a spirit of mutual assistance on a wide range of activities.</P>
    <P>Following the acceptance by me of those guidelines as a basis on which plans could be drawn up there followed what I can describe to the House as probably the most widespread and most democratic system of consultation on the hospital services that has ever been carried through.  In every health board area a working group was set up, with membership drawn from the health board, the comhairle itself and the regional hospital Board, to consider in the context of the guidelines what realistic <Col N="685" /> options existed for future policy. Each working group produced its options and in every area the county health advisory committee within the health board had an opportunity of giving their opinions.  All these opinions were presented to me.  The options of the working group were then relayed to the comhairle, to the health boards, to the regional hospital boards and they were invited to give their views on the solution which in their opinion was most appropriate to the particular area.  These also were submitted to me and I have outlined them very clearly in the document which I have published.</P>
    <P>In addition I had very many requests for deputations from particular areas and I have given an account of those in my published statement also. These deputations were received in the majority of cases by myself, or occasionally by another Minister acting on my behalf, reports on all of which were given to me.  I was equipped then probably as no Minister ever was before with advice from all quarters&mdash;some of it conflicting, some of it undoubtedly based on local interests, but much of it objective and all of it well argued.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, it was quite clear to me from an early stage that no matter which way the decisions went some people would be disappointed. This was inevitable given the fact that choices as to location had to be made.</P>
    <P>In the event I made my recommendations to the Government, and the Government took their decisions after long and earnest consideration. If I had been starting off with a clean sheet, with no existing hospitals in the country, my task would have been a comparatively easy one; but I was dealing with a situation on the ground, with an existing hospital service which could not be ignored. While I expect criticism and am willing and anxious to explain and defend my decisions, I totally reject the suggestion that my plan should be condemned as inadequate or unsuitable. The vast bulk of the decisions are strictly within the guidelines set out by the comhairle.  In addition, they <Col N="686" /> are in line with the recommendations of the health boards, which are the statutory bodies set up to administer the hospital services, or most of them, in the eight areas into which the country is divided.</P>
    <P>This last point is of critical importance. The decisions which I took in relation to hospital locations were not only almost all within the terms of the guidelines set down by Comhairle na nOspidéal, but each and every one of them were in agreement with recommendations made by our health boards. I should say that I paid special attention to the recommendations of each health board.  I did so, firstly because these boards are the main agencies for administering health services in this country and therefore speak with intimate knowledge and authority on behalf of their regions.  Secondly, health boards comprise local public representatives of all parties, together with representatives of the health care professions working in the region.  For these reasons I took the views of our health boards very seriously indeed and as I have said, accepted their views.</P>
    <P>I hope I have said enough on this matter to refute the Irish Medical Association's allegation that the comhairle's guidelines were overthrown for political reasons and that medical recommendations have been ignored. The plan is based on medical recommendations and in almost all respects is consistent with the views of Comhairle na nOspidéal, over which body I exercise no control.  In addition, as I have said, it is consistent with the recommendations of our health boards, over which on this issue I exercise no control either.</P>
    <P>If I may take the health board areas one by one, I would like to refer to the decisions taken and very briefly the reasons for them.</P>
    <P>As regards the Eastern Health Board area, I have already referred to the decision to provide six major general hospitals in the city, and this will of course affect the whole of the area of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>As regards the Midland Health Board area, the working group put forward three possible solutions which <Col N="687" /> would satisfy the guidelines of the comhairle:</P>
    <P>(a)  One large general hospital at Tullamore;</P>
    <P>(b)  Two smaller general hospitals at Mullingar and Portlaoise;</P>
    <P>(c)  Two smaller general hospitals at Athlone and Portlaoise, although this was considered by the working party to be the least desirable.</P>
    <P>All of the health administrative bodies except one favoured the selection of Mullingar and Portlaoise as the development centres, and these bodies were the Midland Health Board, Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Dublin Regional Hospital Board and the Laois Longford and Westmeath County Health Advisory Committees.  The only voice against was from the Offaly County Health Advisory Committee, which favoured the establishment of a large general hospital in Tullamore.</P>
    <P>I decided that the advantages of having two hospitals in Mullingar and Portlaoise heavily outweighed the advantage of a single hospital at Tullamore for a number of reasons.  First of all the two hospitals are better located to cover road accident work, as they are on major routes from Dublin; and, secondly, they are capable of expansion to the size required rather more easily than the Tullamore Hospital is.  The selection of Athlone would have meant the development of a new building on a new site and I do not accept that its location is the best, having regard to developments which have taken place in adjacent towns.  Those who disagree with me and say I was wrong must say what they would have done in my place.  If you select Tullamore then you reject Mullingar and Portlaoise. There is no other choice.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise that the development of Mullingar and Portlaoise will take a considerable time to accomplish and that, in the meantime, hospitals in the area, including Tullamore, Athlone and Longford, will continue as they are with an unchanged role. It is clear, however, that Tullamore, Athlone and Longford should become community hospitals.  I shall have <Col N="688" /> something further to say later on about the working of these community hospitals.  Let me say again clearly and without ambiguity that those hospitals I have mentioned will not close down.  They will change their role in time, and each of the three will contribute in a co-ordinated and meaningful way to the hospital services for the entire area.</P>
    <P>As regards the Mid-Western Health Board area, the working group put forward one solution to satisfy the guidelines and this was for a major hospital complex at Limerick city and a smaller general hospital at Fnnis. The Mid-Western Health Board, the Comhairle and the Regional Hospital Board agreed with this, subject in some areas to a number of detailed recommendations regarding hospitals and services in the area.  The health board recommended in addition, that Nenagh Hospital should be retained and up-graded.  The Clare County Health Advisory Committee agreed to the working group's recommendations. The Tipperary NR County Health Advisory Committee recommended that Nenagh Hospital should be retained and up-graded, while the Limerick city and Limerick County Health Advisory Committees agreed with the working group's recommendations and made a number of detailed recommendations themselves about hospitals and services in the Limerick area.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal set up a sub-committee, to which local persons were appointed, to consider the practical arrangements for dealing with hospitals in the Limerick city area in particular, but these discussions proved inconclusive and agreement was not reached.  It is clear that further studies need to be carried out.  Senior officers of my Department will initiate those studies and will visit the area at my request next week.</P>
    <P>I have accepted that Ennis County Hospital and Nenagh County Hospital should be retained in the area and that joint staffing arrangements should be made between Nenagh Hospital and some of the Limerick hospitals, to ensure adequate consultant <Col N="689" /> staffing for Nenagh Hospital and to overcome the difficulty of operating it as a single surgeon hospital. Nenagh Hospital was one of the centres of controversy and I note that Deputy Haughey, when invited in a public interview to comment on my decision about Nenagh, indicated that he, too, would have retained it.  I welcome his endorsement and support for my decision, because I think it is the right decision, in view of the difficulty of forecasting future population trends in the Limerick area and in view of the present uncertainty about the future hospital pattern within Limerick city itself.</P>
    <P>As regards the North-Eastern Health Board area, the working group put forward two possible solutions to satisfy the guidelines:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  A large general hospital at Cavan and a large general hospital at Drogheda.</P>
    <P>(b)  A large general hospital at Cavan, a large general hospital at Drogheda and a smaller general hospital at Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The North-Eastern Health Board and the Louth County Health Advisory Committee recommended the latter.  Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Dublin Regional Hospital Board favoured Cavan and Drogheda as the centres for development.  The Cavan County Health Advisory Committee was satisfied with either option. Monaghan County Health Advisory Committee was satisfied with either option, if Monaghan were substituted for Cavan.  The Meath County Health Advisory Committee went for the three centre development, but wanted Navan substituted for Dundalk.</P>
    <P>I think this summary indicates the kind of difficulty facing a Minister in making decisions.  Because of the difficulties in this area, which were highlighted by deputations which I received, I arranged that an on-the-spot assessment of the capabilities of the institutions in the area would be made by a team of senior officers from my Department. I have received and considered their report and I am satisfied that the Monaghan County Hospital is not so sited or constructed as to be capable <Col N="690" /> of expansion into the kind of general hospital envisaged by the guidelines. In addition, a suggestion that St. Davnet's Psychiatric Hospital be incorporated in the county hospital development was not considered to be well based.  Furthermore, Monaghan is not geographically as well situated as Cavan.  Cavan also has an existing medical hospital which is capable of expansion into the type of general hospital appropriate to the new situation.</P>
    <P>My decision, therefore, was to retain Drogheda and Dundalk as general hospitals and to develop a general hospital in Cavan.  In addition, there is a modern orthopaedic unit at Navan, which I considered should be retained as the regional orthopaedic unit and developed for that purpose, working in conjunction with the Drogheda and Cavan Hospitals.  The County Hospital at Navan is not, in my view, suitable for development as a major general hospital.  In addition, the North-Eastern Health Board wish to involve the board in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, as serving a considerable part of the population of Meath.  I favour this development also. I have decided that Monaghan Hospital should change its role and become a community hospital and in this way continue to play an important and significant part in the hospital service of the future.</P>
    <P>As regards the North-Western Health Board area, the working group put forward one solution only, which would satisfy the Comhairle guidelines, that is, a general hospital at Sligo and a general hospital at Letterkenny. All the health administrative bodies agreed with the working group's recommendation, but the Leitrim County Health Advisory Committee asked that there should be no interference with the status of the County Hospital, Manorhamilton. Letterkenny and Sligo will, accordingly, be designated as the general hospitals for the area and Manorhamilton will be continued as a community hospital with close links with Sligo Hospital.</P>
    <P>As regards the South-Eastern Health Board area, four solutions were put forward by the working <Col N="691" /> group.  The first was for a hospital centre at Wexford, Kilkenny and either Clonmel or Cashel, and this the working group considered to be seriously deficient as leaving Waterford city without a general hospital. The second was a hospital centre at Kilkenny, Waterford, and either Clonmel or Cashel and this also they considered to have a major deficiency, in that a sizeable portion of the population of County Wexford would not be within a radius of 30 miles of a hospital centre.  The third was a hospital centre at Wexford, Kilkenny and Waterford, while the fourth and last was a major hospital at Waterford linking with satellite centres at Wexford, Kilkenny and either Clonmel or Cashel.</P>
    <P>In the event, the first two I have mentioned received no support at all. Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Regional Hospital Board favoured the Wexford, Kilkenny and Waterford solution and the health board and the five local health committees agreed with the four hospital centre solution of Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and either Clonmel or Cashel. I have decided in this case to support the health board four centre solution and to consider further whether Clonmel or Cashel should be the centre for the South Tipperary area.</P>
    <P>As regards the Southern Health Board area, the working group put forward one solution to satisfy the Comhairle guidelines, that is, a hospital centre at Cork, and a major hospital at Tralee and recommended that Bantry Hospital would continue in its present form as an exceptional measure to serve an isolated area. Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Cork Regional Hospital Board agreed with the working group's recommendation and so did the Southern Health Board who added, however, that the Mallow County Hospital should be retained and upgraded.  The North Cork Advisory Health Committee endorsed the Southern Health Board's view; and the South Cork Advisory Health Committee, while accepting the working group's recommendations, also asked that the Mallow decision be reviewed. <Col N="692" /> The Kerry Advisory Committee agreed with the development of a major hospital at Tralee.</P>
    <P>I have approved of the development of a major hospital in Tralee and a project team has, in fact, been established on which my Department is represented.  It has made extremely good progress in the planning of the new hospital there.  In addition, Bantry will be retained, in the special circumstances, as a general hospital.</P>
    <P>The position as between Cork city and Mallow is a complex one.  A new hospital of 600 beds is being built at present in Cork and, in addition, a number of voluntary hospitals operate in the city.  Comhairle na nOspidéal, with my agreement, set up a sub-committee last year which recommended that another major hospital be built in the north-east of Cork city. The sub-committee envisaged the ultimate integration of the voluntary hospitals into this structure.  The committee also recommended interim arrangements, which would affect the voluntary hospitals considerably.  I have received the views of the various interests in Cork on these proposals and there is disagreement about the recommendations.  I find I will need to have discussion with the local interests before the final pattern of the Cork city development can be determined. These discussions are being initiated and senior officers of my Department are to visit the area next week.</P>
    <P>I explained in my statement the need to take a cautious approach to the planning of the Cork area for many reasons, including particular difficulty in establishing population projections and uncertainty about the future hospital pattern within the city.  For these reasons, I have decided, in addition to the development of Tralee and the retention of Bantry, that Mallow Hospital should also be retained and that discussion would be initiated about the joint staffing of Mallow Hospital in association with one or more of the Cork city hospitals, to ensure that Mallow would have adequate staff and that the difficulty of operating it as a single surgeon hospital would be overcome.</P>
    <P>These then, in summary, are the <Col N="693" /> decisions I took in relation to future general hospital development.  We could not allow the situation to continue whereby the absence of firm decisions on a hospital plan precluded development from taking place.  Indeed it can with truth be said that the failure to adopt a plan over the years led to a situation where general hospital development was held back, to the detriment of our hospital services today.</P>
    <P>The plan which I have published constitutes a reasonable balance between the obvious need for fewer and larger hospitals, and the need for a geographical distribution which provides for reasonable access to hospitals on the part of patients.  The latter cannot easily be discounted.  I know that many members of the medical profession tend to favour a hospital system which comprises a few, very large hospitals.  Such a system would certainly be more convenient for the medical profession and would offer them a wider range of facilities than would normally be available in somewhat smaller hospitals. But the fact remains that most patients and their families feel the need to be within a reasonable distance of hospital services.  In my opinion, the inconvenience and hardship caused to them by travelling long distances for hospital care outweights the advantages to be gained in fewer and larger hospitals.</P>
    <P>In my plan, I have attempted to achieve the best of both worlds.  No one will be more than 30 miles from a general hospital and yet each hospital will be able to provide the full range of facilities normally associated with a general hospital.  In addition, major national specialities will be located in our larger hospitals, which will be well enough staffed and equipped to carry out complex work of the highest level.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to comment on the small number of criticisms which I heard about the plan.  Deputy Haughey criticised it on the basis that the expenditure which will be involved and the scale of development envisaged has not been spelt out.  That criticism, with respect, is based on a misunderstanding of the plan.  The plan is concerned with indicating <Col N="694" /> the locations at which general hospital development will take place in the future.  That was the first decision which had to be taken and it is taken in this plan.  Until the locations were decided and announced it was not possible to undertake the detailed studies required to determine development and expenditure needs.</P>
    <P>I am now proceeding as rapidly as possible to plan the actual, detailed implementation of the proposals. Already project teams have made considerable progress in planning the new hospital in Tralee and the major extension at Letterkenny.  Also, I have informed the Western Health Board that a project team should be set up to plan the development of Castlebar hospital.  In addition, I am asking each health board about the priorities for development in their area, from which I can immediately determine our national building priorities.</P>
    <P>Until all of this detailed evaluation is carried out, it will not be possible to indicate with accuracy the overall expenditure which is likely to be required. On the basis of tentative estimates, however, I can inform the House that gross capital expenditure is likely to be of the order of £65 million at present price levels excluding the cost of development in Cork and Limerick cities. This is very much a tentative estimate, while the final figure will not be known until the detailed planning to which I referred has been carried out.</P>
    <P>As far as the length of time which will be required to implement the plan is concerned, again it obviously is not possible to give an accurate forecast at this time.  The pace of implementation will depend firstly, on the availability of resources, which in turn depends on the rate at which economic recovery takes place and, secondly, on the speed at which detailed planning and building can be carried through.</P>
    <P>The detailed planning and building of modern hospitals is a complex matter.  In the case of the Wilton Hospital, which is at present being built in Cork city, the time involved from briefing to opening will be of the order of 8½ years.  I will certainly do what I can to minimise unnecessary delays in this regard as far as the new hospital <Col N="695" /> plan is concerned.</P>
    <P>It should be possible, given the right economic circumtances, to implement the hospital plan in less than 15 years. I would emphasise, however, that this is a tentative estimate only and one which is dependent on the factors I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I have also heard the criticism that my plan does not go far enough towards rationalising our present general hospital system, and that we will still have too many hospitals in the country.  I must reject this criticism also.  I have already pointed out that my plan strikes a reasonable balance between the need for fewer and larger hospitals, on the one hand, and the need for a widespread geographical distribution of hospitals, on the other. This reality can be demonstrated in the following way.</P>
    <P>My plan will, in fact, lead to a reduction in the number of general hospitals from 54 to a maximum of 33. On the other hand, I only propose to reduce the number of urban centres at which acute hospitals will be located from 27 to 23.  What the plan achieves, therefore, is a very major reduction in hospital numbers, while, at the same time, retaining hospitals in almost the same number of urban centres as before. We will, therefore, create a situation in which there will be considerably fewer and larger hospitals in the country, while no individual will need to travel more than 30 miles for acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>This seems to me to be rationalisation at its best.  My plan takes account both of the need for better hospital care in larger centres and of the need of ordinary people to feel that they can receive hospital attention within reasonable proximity to their homes.</P>
    <P>I have been asked on a number of occasions to outline more clearly the role and function of the proposed community hospitals.  As I said previously, some existing county hospitals and some of the larger district hospitals, such as Athlone and Ballina, will take on this form.</P>
    <P>The determination of the exact role which each community hospital will play will be worked out at a later stage in consultation with the relevant <Col N="696" /> health board and will depend primarily on the needs of the area.  But there should be no misunderstanding of the importance of the role which these hospitals will be called upon to play.</P>
    <P>The community hospitals will be centres at which a wide range of out-patient services at consultant level will be provided.  They will be centres to which patients could go both before and after treatment in acute general hospitals and at which consultants from the main hospital centres will attend as required.  Some specialised services, such as radiology, could appropriately be based in community hospitals also.</P>
    <P>The precise role of each individual community hospital and its relationship to the surrounding general hospitals will be worked out in detail later. I think I have said enough, however, to indicate that I envisage that they will play a highly important role in acute patient care in the future.  They will provide a very important link between the community and the very expensive services available in our acute general hospitals, a link which will be very valuable both from the point of view of convenience of the patient and in terms of minimising expenditure.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, Comhairle na nOspidéal have recently published a discussion document on the role of these smaller hospitals.  It will form the basis of discussion with our health boards in working out the details of each community hospital's role and I hope that Deputies who are members of health boards will contribute their views on this matter at the appropriate health board meetings.</P>
    <P>I believe that the present hospital plan is a good one.  I was faced with a number of difficult decisions, but I took them because the future of our hospital services depends on sound planning being carried out now. There can be no more delays or equivocation.</P>
    <P>We must press on, as we are doing, towards providing a modern general hospital system in this country.  As I have said already, I will carry out the detailed planning and development envisaged in the plan as quickly as <Col N="697" /> possible and no effort will be spared on my part to secure high quality hospital care for all our people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I know that people in some areas of the country are disappointed that their hospitals will not be retained as general hospitals in the long term.  Equally, I know that some people may be disappointed that their district hospital will not become a general hospital.  I understand their disappointment.  But I would ask them to understand the dilemma which faced me.  We cannot have expensive, modern general hospitals in every town, or even in every county.  It simply is not either economically possible or medically feasible.  Choices had to be made and they were made on the best information available, following widespread and comprehensive consultations.</P>
    <P>For the first time in more than 30 years we now have a plan.  While local interests may quarrel with some of the individual decisions taken on it, I think it can be said that, seen as a whole, it is suited to the needs of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should explain at the outset that we are opposing this token Estimate in order to indicate our total dissatisfaction with the Minister for Health's inept approach to this vitally important national issue of a development programme for our network of hospital institutions.  If any of us either on this side of the House or outside was optimistic enough to expect the Minister to avail of this opportunity, which we have provided for him, even at this stage to mend his hand, to produce a positive plan, to dispel the could of uncertainty that hangs over our entire health services because of the Minister's indecision on key issues in this area, any such hopes were in vain. There is nothing new in the Minister's statement today.  He has merely served up again for us in slightly different wording his announcement of 21st October.  There is not one single solitary new factor, not one new decision, brought to our notice here today.  The Minister's statement is historical, defensive, self-excusing.  In particular, I think it is derisory for the Minister to take up a couple of pages of his statement simply repeating for us the wellknown Comhairle guidelines.</P>
      <P>For our purposes today I shall deal mainly with the Minister's statement of 21st October because both that statement and the statement today are interchangeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A firm plan for the development of a rational, inter-related network of hospitals is a paramount need of the health service at this time.  Such a plan is urgently needed and needed now. The whole question has been left unresolved, the state of uncertainty has lasted far too long.  The situation has continued in an unsatisfactory state since 1967 at least.  There is a wide <Col N="699" /> variety of related and important matters which cannot be decided until the hospital development programme has been settled.  That the right sort of programme is settled as quickly as possible is of fundamental importance to our health service.  The right type of hospital in the right place is a basic requirement of a satisfactory health service.  Furthermore, the amount of public expenditure involved in our national situation is of such social and economic significance that this plan must be drawn as carefully as possible with the greatest foresight and the maximum possible economy in the mobilisation and the use of the resources available to us.</P>
    <P>The statement issued by the Minister for Health on 21st October this year cannot possibly be regarded as a national development plan of the sort that is required.  Looked at as objectively as possible, it is nothing more than an outline discussion paper.  I think a suitable description of it would be, &ldquo;some thoughts on the possible lines of Irish hospital development produced by a principal officer in the Department of Health.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister made an announcement; he did not produce a plan.  His announcement consisted of a series of unrelated proposals with no coherent or consistent line of approach and with an important number of key questions left unanswered, a number of major questions left undecided. The Minister's document has all the appearance of having come through a political mangle.  There is clear, unmistakeable evidence on the face of that document that a number of the decisions have been dictated by party political pressures and that they represent unworthy, shortsighted attempts to win local support on unworthy grounds.</P>
    <P>I believe the Irish Medical Association are absolutely right in the criticism they have made.  I do not consider it necessary to dwell too long here this morning on the Minister's serious dereliction of duty in this regard. It is self-evident that his shortsighted, partisan, vacillating approach can only bring our whole political <Col N="700" /> process here in regard to health matters into sad disrepute.  I just want, however, to give one concrete example of the dishonest double standards that the Minister has adopted for different areas.  Other Deputies on this side of the House will give others.</P>
    <P>The Minister states categorically that no one will be more than 30 miles from a general hospital.  Elsewhere in his statement he defends a decision in relation to the south eastern region on the basis that a particular solution put forward would have had the major deficiency that a sizeable portion of the population of County Wexford would not be within a radius of 30 miles of a hospital centre.  Absolutely consistent.  It is interesting that Deputy Hugh Gibbons had to ask for information about the area in which he is interested because when we come to the western seaboard there are places&mdash;Killala, Ballycastle, Belderrig, that whole area&mdash;which are 50 and 60 miles from the general hospital in Castlebar. How is this inconsistency explained by the Minister?  I suggest his approach has given the map of the south-eastern corner a distinctly overcrowded appearance.  There we have a firm adherence by the Minister to the 30 mile radius limit but when it comes to the western seaboard and the regions around Killala and Ballycastle 50 or 60 miles is good enough for the people of that area.</P>
    <P>Despite the criticism that can be made of the Minister's handling of this issue, I still think it is important that we refute the suggestion which is often heard that the hospital development programme should be taken out of the realm of politics and decided upon exclusively medical grounds by medical men.  In my view that would not be legitimate and would create many fundamental problems.  Our health services are a social service.  They deal with the individual in the community and his welfare.  They are concerned with his well-being in a fundamental way.  The building, the extending, the upgrading or down grading of a hospital is a community matter.  The decision involves economic, social and medical considerations and the matters which <Col N="701" /> arise in relation to a hospital development programme, therefore, are matters for political decision.  When coming to those political decisions a politician undoubtedly must seek and be guided by the best possible medical advice available to him.  The medical content is a fundamental element in this decision-making process.  It is only the medical expert who can outline how the best return is to be procured from the available resources.  It is only a medical expert who can demonstrate to us what is urgent and vital and what is merely peripheral even though it might be desirable.</P>
    <P>It is only the medical experts who can explain to us accurately what the possibilities are and what are the likely results of alternative lines of development. But the final decision must be a community decision and, therefore, a political decision.  In this context I hope it is not necessary for me to emphasise that I mean political in the true sense of that word; political in that it weights carefully all the factors, economic, social, medical involved and seeks to achieve the best overall interest of the community and to disregard vested interest of every sort.</P>
    <P>I can best attempt to demonstrate the inadequacies which we see in the Minister's announcement by indicating what, in our view, should be the essential components of a national hospital development plan.  Firstly, there must be finality.  In that sense it must really be a plan, a finalised plan and not just a set of proposals.  The plan must bring an end to uncertainty because uncertainty means that comprehensive health care planning is impossible.  It means that Comhairle na nOspidéal cannot proceed to define appointments and fill the large numbers of consultant appointments which are now vacant or shortly to become vacant.  It means that all those things which should dovetail into the hospital network, especially the community care programme and the out-patient services, cannot be proceeded with on any firm basis.</P>
    <P>I belive also that the plan must be firmly based on economic realities; it must have regard to the resources immediately available to us today <Col N="702" /> and those which can, with any degree of certainty, be projected over the next decade or so.  Undoubtedly, a very sophisticated, perfectly tailored plan could be drawn up if we were starting from square one with no existing structures but we are not. There is a comprehensive range of institutions already there and those institutions comprise a wide degree of suitability as to premises and location. They have their own traditions and their particular predilections towards certain lines of development.  They have served the nation well and their position, their status, and that indefinable thing which is tradition, must all be recognised and carefully treated in the new national development programme.</P>
    <P>In that connection there are two fundamental factors in our situation here to which any plan must be firmly anchored.  The first is that we have a relatively low density of population. We have 43 persons per square kilometer, compared with 230 in the United Kingdom, 319 in Belgium and 117 in Denmark.  I mention these figures to try to convey a sense of the relatively sparse way in which our population is distributed.  By European standards we have a low density of population and that is a fundamental factor to be taken into account in our planning.  We also have a high existing number of hospital beds per head of the population. It is surprising how high that number is in relation to Europe generally. Admittedly, all of these beds are not ideally located.  Nor is some of the accommodation of the highest possible standard but when resources are scarce and when there are almost insatiable demands on existing national resources the fullest use must be made of those existing beds and our plan must be clever and ingenious in incorporating them into its scope.  It must get the best possible and most economic use it can from them.</P>
    <P>Before I heard the Minister mention 15 years today I had intended criticising the fact that there is no definite period stated by the Minister for his proposals.  In my view this is essential.  In this, as in any other <Col N="703" /> area, a plan cannot be a plan if it is imprecise and indefinite as to its timing.  It should at least set out to try to achieve some of its objectives within a certain time.  This is necessary from a number of points of view. It is necessary to give the plan the sense of firmness of purpose which is essential and also from the planning point of view.  There is a wide variety of factors which will not have any specific or particular meaning unless related to a time schedule.  It is also very important from the point of view of the personnel engaged, whether medical, nursing or administrative, how they are to be deployed throughout the hospital network, how they are going to plan their careers and make their domestic arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the plan be stated to extend over a specific period of time, from the point of view of interim problems arising in certain institutions.  I will deal with that later and explain what I mean by it.  My view is that the ideal period for this plan would be a decade.  I would settle on that period for two main reasons.  In the present state of our forecasting of economic and social matters, ten years is about as far ahead as we can make economic and fiscal projections.  It is as far ahead as we can, with any validity, identify population trends.  I do not think we could attempt to forecast trends in medicine and science much longer than that either, if even we can do it for that length.  I am also influenced by the fact that in a modern context, eight to ten years is about the period it takes from the time it is decided to build a new hospital until its completion.  All in all, I believe we should decide on a programme which would be stated to extend over a period of ten years.  If we do that, we could space out particular individual developments over that period, break the ten-year period of the plan into shorter specific phases and indicate that certain things will be done within the particular periods of time indicated.</P>
    <P>The next thing that is essential to the plan-and here, again, the Minister <Col N="704" /> has made no attempt to come to grips with reality&mdash;is that there must be some attempt to quantify expenditures. I know that will be fraught with difficulties and complexities, but I believe it must be attempted.  These expenditures which we would project for the plan would represent some relationship between the plan's rate of progress and the macro-economic projections of the Department of Finance and our other economic institutions.  I believe this is essential to the plan and it will involve isolating in the national budget for public capital expenditure each year a specific sum for the hospital development programme.  That specific sum could be expressed as a percentage of the total capital expenditure or a fixed amount.  If it were a fixed amount, it would necessarily have to be adjusted forward for future inflation. I believe it is important and fundamental that some sort of quantification of total national expenditure on the hospital development building programme be included for the period of the plan.  If that is done, a further step would be that each of the eight regional health boards would also have a fixed predetermined allocation from the central national amount.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat encouraged in making that proposition by the fact that the Department of Health, in common with other Government Departments, are now moving towards, more slowly or rapidly as the case may be, programme budgeting.  If there is any realistic attempt towards programme budgeting in the Department of Health, I suggest that a very necessary aspect of that would be the setting aside of a definite predetermined amount of capital expenditure for the hospital development programme each year.</P>
    <P>When that national target has been determined, it could then be broken down into regional amounts.  That would be of enormous importance to the regional boards because there is widespread agreement that the way in which the finances of the regional boards are ordered at present is totally unsatisfactory.  My colleague, Deputy C. Murphy, will be dealing <Col N="705" /> with that point in more detail later.  It is completely unsatisfactory that a health board should have to have its allocation for capital expenditure settled on a year-to-year basis and that its capital development programmes must of necessity be piecemeal, very often involving deputations to the Minister and his Department to see whether some particular isolated item of expenditure can be embarked upon.</P>
    <P>I believe there is no way in which the existing haphazard financial approach can give us the sort of satisfactory programme we want.  In the first instance the Department's own national figure is settled from year to year on a piecemeal basis depending on the current budgetary pressures and the particular situation in regard to capital expenditure facing the Minister for Finance.  That year-to-year uncertainty then extends down to the regional health boards.  I would insist very strongly that these are two essential elements in any proposed programme: firstly, that it be clearly expressed to be for a specific period of years and, secondly, in so far as it can be done, that the annual expenditure figures be settled in advance for the period.</P>
    <P>I want to dispose of the argument which is sometimes put forward and which I suspect pervades Government thinking at the present time, that because of the critical state of near bankruptcy to which our public finances have been reduced, nothing can be planned or undertaken at present, that no future developments can be decided because of the present appalling and dreadful financial situation. That would be a policy of despair. The present financial paralysis which has descended on this Government means that some urgent and necessary expenditures cannot be undertaken at present and, to that extent, the standard of our health services generally will have to suffer.  A great deal of the expenditures involved in the national hospital development plan will not, however, fall due to be met for many years to come.  There is no reason, no matter what the present financial situation is, why planning should not proceed now even if <Col N="706" /> much of the work which is planned has to wait for execution for better economic and financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is eminently desirable that planning should go ahead immediately because the fact that we have an economic recession has the doubtful advantage of ensuring that a considerable quantity of planning skills and capacities, a number of architects, engineers, surveyors and draftsmen, are readily available to the Department and the Minister for planning purposes that would not be available in times of full employment.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the planning proposals to which I should like to draw attention, and that is the need to try to incorporate into the hospital construction programme, and, indeed, the equipment supply programme, some sort of rationalisation and standardisation. In both building and the provision of services and equipment this must be seriously attempted.  It seems to me irrational that each of the eight regional boards should have to provide their own separate professional machinery to deal with situations which are common to all of them.  There is considerable scope for economising in this area and that some rationalisation of planning procedures, construction methods, equipment supply and so on should be invoked.</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn briefly to the specific proposals the Minister outlined in his statement.  As he said in reference to Dublin, there is widespread acceptance of the two northside and two southside hospitals, but in regard to the Dublin situation I want to make one criticism.  That criticism is that the situation in regard to national specialist centres requires to be brought under some sort of control and to be rationalised.</P>
    <P>The situation in Cork is totally unsatisfactory. The Minister referred to the situation in Mallow and I do not think anybody will quarrel with him about it.  But the whole situation in Cork city is undecided and it must be recognised that urgent decisions are vitally necessary there.  The Minister keeps fobbing off crucial decisions on the basis that he will have further consultations. Surely the time has come to take the decisions?  There has been <Col N="707" /> enough discussion and consultation, enough possible alternative solutions have been put forward.  If the Minister wants to give the overall plan any semblance of finality, he must settle on a positive programme for Cork.</P>
    <P>There are other areas throughout the country which are still unresolved, still the source of controversy, and on which final decisions must be taken.  There is the federation between Roscommon and Portiuncula, the retention of the orthopaedic hospital in Navan, the very vexed question of the general hospital in Tullamore, the future of the Monaghan hospital, the incapacity of the Minister to come to a decision between Cashel and Clonmel.</P>
    <P>That brief outline of the areas in which decisions are awaited is sufficient to convey the degree of uncertainty that still persists about the whole programme, despite the two announcements made by the Minister, one on 21st October and the other today. Neither of the Minister's statements makes any attempt to come to grips with the very important need to establish national specialist centres, neurosurgical, renal and poison, and a general accident emergency unit on the lines of the one in Birmingham.  The catchment areas for such centres must be decided.  In Britain they are between 1 million and 2 million people.  Those figures pose very important geographical questions from our point of view.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the tendency has been towards piecemeal development. These sort of centres must be brought under control and recognised national specialist centres for these disciplines integrated into the national development plan as a whole.  That I consider as one of the very serious omissions in the Minister's whole approach.  He is not making any attempt to provide a rationalised logical system of national specialist centres in the way that is so vitally necessary and will become increasingly necessary in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference to what I consider to be another very important aspect of this type of programme. I have referred to it as the interregnum.  It affects practically every area.  I am concerned about the <Col N="708" /> situation that will arise where the status and the standards of existing institutions will be, as people might call it, downgraded.  I look at it from the point of view of the role and the status of an institution being changed and serious problems arising which will affect the medical care and attention available to people in particular areas as a result of the change.  It is one of the complex aspects of this whole matter.</P>
    <P>Let me take Monaghan as a classic example.  Deputy Leonard will have more to say about that portion of the Minister's plan.  I want to use it at the moment to illustrate what I call the interregnum problem.  The Minister proposes that Monaghan hospital will be changed into a community hospital and that a new hospital will be built in Cavan to become the general hospital for that area.  Whatever one might think of the merits of that proposal, I want to draw attention to the interim implications: what is to happen in the meantime when the people of the Monaghan area are aware the institution is to be changed into a community hospital and the new general hospital in Cavan, with all its facilities, is still not available and will not be for five, six or eight years?  Is it not clear that in the interval Monaghan will be run down as an institution?  From the point of view of the staff and others, there will be a continuing process of reducing that hospital from its present role and the new facilities will not yet be provided in Cavan.</P>
    <P>I am merely using Monaghan and Cavan to illustrate a type of problem which will be repeated around the country.  There will be a serious gap from the point of view of the people of particular areas while the status of the existing hospital is being changed but it is still expected to provide services pending the establishment of the new centre.  I believe that this is a very serious aspect and I cannot see that the Minister makes any provision for it or gives any thought to it. Hospital that have been providing a certain level of medical care and attention for a particular area will <Col N="709" /> have their services and facilities run down but the people of that area will not have access to the new facilities which are projected for them and they will be left in a very difficult and serious situation in the interim.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that from the strictly medical point of view the plan which was outlined in the Fitzgerald Report was the most acceptable.  In Fianna Fáil we accepted that report in principle.  In retrospect, perhaps, it is possible to see that it was too radical for certain elements in the profession and for a considerable body of local community opinion.  There was a view also held that the committee was entirely medical in its composition and, secondly, because certain institutions were representated on it while others were not, perhaps influencing the final decision.  In any event, the report generated fairly widespread opposition on social grounds; on the basis that community considerations had not been taken into account at all and that certain institutions had been scheduled for downgrading without the committee having ever visited them.</P>
    <P>As this reaction to the Fitzgerald Report developed, Comhairle na nOspidéal was established and brought into the picture.  It is well to note that this is not the primary function of the Comhairle.  In an ideal situation the Comhairle would be concerned solely with staffing and the provision of services in an existing structure of hospitals and institutions already there.  But I suppose, in our circumstances, it is not unreasonable to bring the Comhairle into the question of settling the pattern of hospital development because, undoubtedly, the form that pattern takes will have an important influence on the decisions they will take later regarding staff and services.</P>
    <P>There is widespread agreement that the Comhairle has brought a high degree of professional competence to its work.  It is also true that the Comhairle at present have lapsed into a state of frustrated ineffectiveness because of the Minister's indecision and incapacity to act on the recommendations <Col N="710" /> the Comhairle are putting forward.  That is a situation which demands the Minister's urgent and disinterested attention.  Hospitals are only as good as the people who staff them: the whole programme of hospital development can be made ineffective unless the new Comhairle, which must be appointed on 1st January, is of the highest possible calibre, of the same calibre as the first Comhairle and further unless the new Comhairle is given a cast-iron assurance by the Minister that its work will be meaningful and that its recommendations will be accepted except in very special and rare circumstances. That is essential if we are to get the sort of people we require to serve on the new Comhairle.</P>
    <P>Both the Fitzgerald recommendations and the Comhairle guidelines have one definite, clear-cut principle in common.  They both definitely and positively recommend that the system of hospitals as we have known it, staffed by a single surgeon and a single physician must be discontinued. Fitzerald visualised 12 centres but the Comhairle guidelines widened that approach to admit smaller, general hospitals in certain restricted and particular situations.  I totally reject as unsustainable the Minister's accusation in his statement today when he said:</P>
    <P>I know that many members of the medical profession tend to favour a hospital system which comprises a few, very large hospitals.  Such a system would certainly be more convenient for the medical profession...</P>
    <P>I do not believe that either in the Fitzgerald recommendations or the Comhairle guidelines there is implicit any attention by the medical profession to their own convenience. I believe their recommendations were based entirely on scientific, medical, objective standards. The Comhairle guidelines recognise that there will be particular problems in certain areas and their recognition of that fact is of very considerable significance to us, the non-medical people who have to take decisions in these areas.  This broadening by the Comhairle of the very <Col N="711" /> strict principles laid down by Fitzgerald are dictated by demographic considerations.  There is certainly both in medical opinion and administrative opinion&mdash;in the sense of persons involved in the administration of the health services&mdash;a very definite view that bigger is better.  The Fitzgerald Report puts it in the following words:</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a very strong case being made in favour of larger hospitals and more specialisation...</P>
    <P>Nobody can quarrel with that overall principle but let us recognise that it can and, perhaps, must be derogated from when particular factors in a particular situation clearly indicate that it should be departed from.  Even when we have to depart from it or go against the trend of larger, better, more specialist hospitals, we should try as far as possible to go against it only in an evolutionary way.  If we must have a temporary solution to a particular problem, it should be seen, to the greatest extent possible, as simply one situation which will evolve into another.  People must come first and when it is necessary for geographical or other self-evident, inescapable reasons to contemplate the continuance in certain areas of a 200-bed, two-surgeon, two-physician type hospital in particularge local circumstances, I submit we can do so in full conformity with the Comhairle guidelines.  I think we would all recognise it is difficult enough to maintain a stable population in some regions given all the possible advantages and benefits we can provide.  In that regard then we must, where necessary, make provision for perhaps smaller and more expensive hospitals if that is dictated by circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have already given an indication to the Minister in the things I have said from time to time that if he adopts a particular proposal for clear-cut, defined known medical and social reasons which are not strictly in line with the Comhairle guidelines then we will not attack such a proposal if it can be seen to be in the best interests of that particular community and particularly if it can be seen to be something which will evolve into a better situation at a <Col N="712" /> later date.  But we will not tolerate and we will attack decisions by the Minister taken for party political reasons in an attempt to capitalise on local sentiment as, regretfully, I am afraid, the Minister has already done in a number of instances.</P>
    <P>An essential part of this process of embarking on a national programme of hospital reorganisation and development is to mobilise public opinion in support of what is proposed.  That is elementary today.  the general public must fully understand what is being done and why it is being done. The reasons for the programme and for the decisions taken must be fully explained.  Developments in regard to hospitals vitally affect local communities and I do not think there is any other area of public administration today where a major programme of this sort affecting so many people in so many ways would be undertaken without an attempt to explain fully to the general public what is involved. If a comprehensive approach explaining the programme, its purposes and its implications, were undertaken a great deal of public uneasiness would be averted and a great deal of opposition in certain areas would be dispelled.  In particular, the role of the new community hospital and the services it will provide should be fully explained at local level. Neither the Minister nor his Department has, as far as I can see, made any attempt to undertake that important aspect of this programme.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we demand that the Minister now acknowledges that his statement of 21st October last can have only the status of a preliminary discussion paper and that he now proceed to produce a proper, fully documented national plan.  I suggest he should issue that plan in book form.  We are dealing here with a matter of long-term, fundamental importance, something which will involve a high proportion of our total national financial and economic resources for a considerable time.  It, therefore, merits something better than a roneoed Government Information Services release.  It should come in some more permanent <Col N="713" /> and respectable form.  If it is to fulfil the purpose it is intended to fulfil it should be a standard reference book for those engaged in the health services for many years to come.  We want the plan the Minister puts before the people to be final and irreversible.  We believe it must be coherent and consistent in its approach to sound planning principles &mdash;medical, social and economic.  It must be carefully dovetailed into the health service and community care programme.  It should be for a fixed period of years, with carefully fixed budget expenditures built into it for that period, and it should be based on economic realities and the existing institutional resources.  It must provide a rational, logical basis of national specialist centres.  It should include as an integral and important part of it a public information and explanation programme.</P>
    <P>If the Minister brings forward that sort of plan within the next few months we will support it.  Even if it involves decisions which are unpopular in particular local areas, we will support it if the Minister can show that the plan represents the proper lines of development in the best interests of the whole community. If that is done we will not attempt&mdash;I give the Minister this promise&mdash;to seek any party political advantage in any particular area provided we are satisfied the Minister's proposals are firm and irreversible and based on sound planning principles and not on political expediency.  If the Minister does not do that, if he does not produce a national hospital development plan along those lines soon, he will have failed, I believe, to discharge seriously one of his primary and most important responsibilities as Minister for Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This plan has been long awaited.  Since I first came in here this plan has been discussed on every Health Estimate.  The aim in drawing up this plan is to mobilise the resources we have in providing hospital care for patients.  We have in this country the highest ratio of doctors, nurses and hospital beds per head of the population.  Our simple task and <Col N="714" /> function then is to mobilise these resources so that the public will benefit to the optimum from these unique advantages.  Unfortunately, over the years haphazard hospital planning, badly devised lay-outs and a bad distribution of resources have necessitated now a more logical approach to the existing piecemeal services available. I am disappointed to find there is no reference in the report to the Army hospitals and to the way in which they could be integrated with civilian hospitals to avoid duplication of facilities.  Civilians in an area where there is an Army hospital should be able to avail of the facilities there in the same way as Army personnel avail of the facilities in civilian hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Minister in the document of 21st October stated, with reference to the Fitzgerald Report, that from the medical point of view, the recommendations were logical but it become clear subsequently that the  concept as then set out did not have sufficient regard to the practical needs and wishes of the people.  This morning the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I know that many members of the medical profession tend to favour a hospital system which comprises a few, very large hospitals. Such a system would certainly be more convenient for the medical profession and would offer them a wider range of facilities than would normally be available in somewhat smaller hospitals.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at these two statements. Since when were facilities of such importance to the medical profession? Surely it is self-evident that facilities should benefit the patient.  I am surprised at the anaemic attempt to throw against the medical profession the innuendo of having a vested interest, be it even a vested interest of convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his public statement on the general hospital development plan the Minister said that the detailed concept, as set out, did not have sufficient regard to the practical needs and wishes of the people.  People can wish for many things but that does not say that they are possible.  Many things <Col N="715" /> for which people wish are not always to their benefit.  The practical needs of people, as outlined in the Fitzgerald Report, would not be referred to so much.  The guidelines are amazing, entirely structural ones and are based entirely on a sliding rule.  There is no reference whatsoever to the trend of population, illness, mobility rates, birth rates, or to any modern hospital planning concept.</P>
    <P>The first guideline is that no patient should be 30 miles away from a general hospital.  Thirty miles is such a variable factor on Irish roads that for serious consideration to be given to this by a group of mature men amazes me.  To travel 30 miles around Dublin city, backwards and forwards at certain hours of the day, can take one many hours depending on traffic conditions and the state of the roads.  To travel 30 miles in areas of Kerry would take one a lot longer than travelling 30 miles along a carriageway such as the Naas Road.  I contend this guideline is invalid in that it is too rigid a factor in the eventual aim.</P>
    <P>The second guideline is of interest in so far as it relates to two consultant surgeons and two consultant physicians. Nowadays, with the demand for time off by the medical as well as other professions, I contend it is a necessary cover&mdash;for example, a consulting surgeon in one hospital will cover his counterpart in the neighbouring hospital.  That is the way it operates at present.  To be in any way progressive in the future it would be necessary to meet these demands.  I am all for reasonable hours.  Therefore, two consultant surgeons would be necessary as would two consultant physicians.  This is such a vague guideline I would not attach a lot of importance to it except inasmuch as it is essential that there be two consultant surgeons and two consultant physicians.</P>
    <P>A population trend of between 75,000 and 100,000 is incorporated in the third guideline.  No consideration has been given to mobility trends or to the population grid breakdown. Therefore, were these plans to be implemented over an eight, ten or 25 <Col N="716" /> year period, by the time many of the hospitals would have been built, they would not be as efficient as one would hope because of changes that can occur in local areas.  For instance, I am thinking of a town like Navan where we expect perhaps one of the biggest population booms the country will ever have experienced. The plan for hospital development in that area rules out Navan, possibly because it is based on the present population figure.</P>
    <P>On page 2 it is said that the Minister accepted the Comhairle guidelines as a reasonable basis.  Then, following those guidelines, the health boards, local advisory committees, and the regional hospital boards set up working groups.  Those working groups reported and, to give the House an idea, there were: the Midland Health Board, Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Dublin Regional Hospital Board, the Laois, Longford, Westmeath County Health Advisory Committees and the Offaly County Health Advisory Committee. That is taking into consideration, in one area, the number of meetings that took place, the number of unnecessary steps taken in bureaucracy, once again pointing out the anaemic hospital plan before us.</P>
    <P>Only one thing can be done here and that is to go ahead with the plan but on the understanding that the problem is one essentially of definition. There is a subjective problem with regard to patients in different areas, if they feel their local hospital has not got the name of specialising they feel it is either run down or is neglected.  That is not the case.  As far as I know each hospital, by and large, will retain the facilities it has already and more progressive facilities will be centred in, say, 33 of those hospitals.  Therefore, instead of having 54 hospitals progressing, acquiring new equipment, extra surgeons, radiologists, anaethetists, the 54 hospitals will start as one and 33 of those will begin to progress.  But it does not mean the automatic downgrading of the remainder.  I do not think that has ever been explained to our people in sufficient detail.</P>
    <P>What in fact is being done is to implement an improvement of the <Col N="717" /> hospital services, But, at the same time, the public relations job done by the Department of Health has been very poor because people do tend to become afraid when they hear that the hospital is, say, going to Tullamore or somewhere else, and local politicians are to blame in this respect also. Even though Deputy Haughey implies that this could be a document which has certain political innuendos and influence, the responsibility lies with all politicians to form pressure groups and such like in an endeavour to retain the facilities there already.</P>
    <P>It is impossible, and is totally dishonest for politicians to say that each of the 54 general hospitals at present will be able to have the facilities with the resources this country prossesses at present.  Perhaps some day they will have.  The most desirable hospital service that any Minister could introduce would be one in which every area would have every facility and people would have the absolute minimum of travel.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a far greater degree of co-operation and coordination between the Departments of Local Government and of Health, where roads might be built more rapidly between large hospital centres so that patients might be more comfortable while travelling.  The facility of relatives visiting a patient in hospital is a luxury in so far as the treatment of the patient must come first and the patient's comfort second.  A haphazard development has taken place in Dublin over the years between the private hospitals, private benefactors, religious orders and the health authority.  We have got 75 hospital buildings in the Dublin area.  We must try to prevent any tendency towards rationalising the archaic buildings we have whereby up to seven old buildings would be put under the one administration in different parts of the city.</P>
    <P>London has done this and it has proved to be chaotic.  It is certainly most expensive.  Many of these buildings will become vacant as in the case of St. James's Hospital, where the specialist facilities have moved in. These old buildings should be used <Col N="718" /> for something else besides medicine. We should try to centralise the facilities and our administration.  The only solution I see to all this is to concentrate on two major super hospitals, one in the Dublin area and one in Cork, as a beginning.  We know the population trends, that Dublin city and Cork, are expanding.  We know the mixed population there is and that we have to provide specialist facilities for the country as a whole.  We know the cost of all this and that our ability to provide those super hospitals is limited.  However, we should start off with a super hospital in Dublin, followed, as facilities and money become available, by one in Cork and later on by one in Galway and possibly one in Limerick.</P>
    <P>I lean more towards the Fitzgerald Report in relation to hospital planning. Very little consideration appears to have been given to the fact that as diagnostic facilities improve in hospitals, the medical profession becomes more efficient and diseases are diagnosed at an earlier date, the amount of time spent by patients in hospitals increases.  They come back more often for particular tests.  The pathological examinations and tests are more complex.  Work of hospitals can be taken up to a very large degree with repetitive tests.  This is something which should be considered when one is talking about hospital facilities for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Sufficient attention has not been paid to what the situation is today and what it will be in ten, 20 or 50 years time.  We are inheriting the very poor planning which existed over the years, the particular type of hospital distribution which took place in the thirties of one hospital per county without any consideration given to the factors I have mentioned.  We are doing the same thing again.  We are doing it purely on a statistical basis, on a geographical outline when that has very little relevance in hospitals today. It would only be of relevance in a very isolated area.  It has no relevance whatsoever to attempt to relate diagnostic treatment and acute care facilities to geographical areas on the breakdown of 100,000 people in each <Col N="719" /> area apart from the relevance of the wishes of the people, that they wish to have hospital facilities next door to them.</P>
    <P>We must realise that what one does is not always the most popular thing locally but for the betterment of the people in general and for the new generation we should be brave and take those decisions.  There is no reference to a centralised computing chart system, which is not unusual today.  I would like to see a follow-up from maternity hospitals, through paediatric hospitals, general hospitals and into geriatric hospitals.  We have ceased to have an emigration rate of any significance.  We have, in fact, possibly a small immigration rate but we have no plan at all for the followon care of people in the country.  We have several maternity hospitals in this city, about six paediatric hospitals, a dozen teaching hospitals and a duplicity of filing and charting.  It is estimated that when a patient enters a hospital, even for two days, his name and address are written up to 40 times.  We should take a closer look at the overall possibility of using computerised information regarding patients.  Deputy Haughey pointed out that we have not a very large population but that it is widely dispersed.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to some factors which have not been considered to the degree I consider they should have been.  I refer particularly to the heart disease rate in the country, the respiratory tract disease rate, the incidence of lung cancer, blood vessel disease and where best to distribute the specialist facilities. There does not seem to be any reference whatsoever to this.  If this was a business report presented by an accountant the only person it could be presented by is a politician.  As a member of the medical profession I find this very disappointing.  There was some hope from the Fitzgerald Report. The only answer to all this is to concentrate on two or three super hospitals where all facilities will be available and patients can be transported to them.  After that we should consider providing for the accessory comforts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> There is a great need for a national hospital for nervous diseases.  I am not speaking about neurosis or psychiatric ailments.  I refer particularly to diseases of the nervous system, tumours and lesions.  This is catered for admirably by the staff in St. Lawrence's Hospital and the medical specialists there.  There is a machine, which is perhaps the most revolutionary machine ever invented, called the EMI scanner, which costs approximately £250,000.</P>
    <P>There is a neurological unit in this hospital for the whole country.  This machine can be used to look into the brain without any operation.  It is the most revolutionary invention since the invention of the X-ray.  We have not got this machine yet.  I believe requests for it to the Department of Health have been turned down on a few occasions.  It would be of tremendous benefit. There is no use in talking about expanding the bricks and mortar of many hospitals when one hospital cannot have a vital piece of modern equipment because of lack of money.  Without any medical vested interest&mdash;I would once again take the Minister to task for the possible suggestion of vested interest&mdash; if the Department of Health do not purchase this type of vital equipment we will just have to concentrate equipment in one or two areas and have the maximum turn-over of patients around the limited equipment available and it is a facade to tell the country that we can equip 33 general hospitals.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer in passing to the health boards.  I never thought the health boards were a good idea and of late I am becoming more convinced that they are bureaucratic monsters that devour the £ sterling as quickly as we can produce it with very little benefit coming to the patient.  I would like to refer also to the wonderful facilities that can be made available through the general medical services scheme and through the computer used by the Department of Health.  For instance, it has been found that the average visitation rate per patient on the GMS card is almost twice that of the total population of the UK.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was always expected that this would be so because it was the lower socio-economic group that was covered by the GMS card.  It was felt in the UK that the visitation rate of the lower socio-economic group might be higher than that of the middle or upper socio-economic group but they never had any statistics to show.  We have shown, by dividing the number of patients into the number of doctors and the number of claims, that this is the visitation rate of 35 per cent of our population.  That statistic can be of tremendous importance. It can be related to each health board area and to each individual doctor.  For instance, it is greater west of the Shannon than east of the Shannon or it is greater in one part of a county than in another part and what factors are involved?  I am surprised that the medical luminaries in the Department of Health have not taken the ball on the hop.</P>
      <P>It has been shown that the incidence of respiratory tract illness in high-rise, centrally-heated flats in the Continent and in the UK has increased by 33 per cent.  Yet we have captive areas in this city where no investigation has taken place.  When I first started a dispensary in such an area I got the impression that there was an unusually high incidence of a particular type of illness but one had no means of putting a finger on what it was because of the changing population and the volume of work to be done.  I would call on the Minister and the Department of Health to carry out an investigation into mobility trends.  I am sure the medical men in the field would be only too glad to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vitally important information which should have been ascertained before the building of any hospital is whether the introduction of the fee per item GMS service resulted in any decrease in the number of patients entering hospital.  It was hoped that with the introduction of this service the domiciliary attention to patients would increase and improve and that the admission rate to hospitals would decrease.  Information such as this should be available and if the Department were applying their resources properly this is the type of information <Col N="722" /> that would be available.  At the last count there were 42,000 patients awaiting hip operations.  That figure came from an individual doctor who bothered to investigate.  We want to know more about the birth trends in the country.  We want to know more about the direction of illness&mdash;the way tuberculosis has gone off at a tangent, dropped down and stabilised, possibly increasing a little and the way heart disease and cancer have come to the fore.</P>
    <P>We want to know more about the dental hospital.  We want to know what is to be done about the peculiar saga in which very eminent members of the dental profession in Dublin and Cork have found themselves involved. They are in a most peculiar dilemma. If the Department of Health are providing the money, they must bear the responsibility for any uncertainty which may be apparent to professional teachers of dentistry.  These are all very highly qualified and gifted people.  Much of their time appears to be taken up unnecessarily in dealing with the confusion in regard to the concentration of facilities in Cork and Dublin.  It is reasonable to suggest that both of those large cities should have a dental hospital with the most modern equipment.  I have seen many people in Dublin who have dental problems.  There is a need for a specialised dental hospital in the Dublin area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">

      <P>It is heading in that direction.  It was disturbing to see the confusion there was at that time.  In planning and in moving ahead, as they are obviously going to do, the Department should obtain a standardised design.  They should consult with designers of hospitals throughout the world.  They should have a smaller ward area.  They should have private wings and private hospital beds attached to the public areas.  They should encourage the consultants to have their consulting rooms on the hospital campus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> I should like to pay tribute to all those who help to run our hospitals and to the great work done by individual families, religious orders, members of the nursing profession, to the medical staffs, and the surgical staffs of the hospitals.  Their dedication, tenacity and stamina in catering for patients are second to none, and of that we can be immensely proud.</P>

      <P>It was with great sadness that members of this House learned of the sudden death of a very popular man and an international surgeon, Mr. Jamsie Meagher.  He was a shining example to all members of the medical profession.  He is a tremendous loss not only in his capacity as a surgeon but also in his capacity for giving counsel and advice to doctors of my generation.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to Lady Valerie Goulding on the wonderful work she is doing in the Central Remedial Clinic, to all the fund-raisers and members of sub-committees of hospitals, to all the members of the voluntary hospital boards who do such tremendous work in their spare time to fill in the gaps and plug the holes, and to those voluntary groups who visit elderly people and young children in hospital and spend their time talking to them and making them feel at ease.</P>
      <P>Professionally I am disappointed with this plan.  Unless we have unlimited funds, I cannot see how, apart from marginally, it will improve the standard of facilities and the medical care available to the population at large.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Haughey's call for a rejection of this plan.  The Minister said previously he is conscious that there is a total lack of a co-ordinated plan on which hospital development could be based for the future.  This bears no semblance to a plan.  As Deputy Haughey said, there is no time limit.  If it has not got a time scale, it cannot be rated as a plan.  People expected a radical approach to the rationalisation of hospitals but the change is minimal, a reduction from 27 to 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> The Minister also said a further study was being initiated with a view to reaching agreement on a long-term plan for the Limerick area and efforts to reach agreement must be finalised with the local interests concerned.  He also said that taking a long-term decision in relation to hospitalisation in Cork may be particularly difficult and, for planning purposes, it has been assumed that there will be a considerably expansion in the population.  He said this expansion could be considerably greater than anticipated in existing projections if a large-scale oil and gas industry is developed in the area and, therefore, any decision taken in relation to Cork city development for hospital purposes must be somewhat tentative.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the county hospital in Monaghan.  I should like to convey to the House the extent of the resentment and anger felt against the proposal to downgrade the county hospital. There are meetings nightly throughout the county.  There was a large public meeting in Monaghan town.  Functions were held to collect funds to convey people to a march which it is proposed to hold in Dublin on 10th January.  The local newspaper, <i>The Northern Standard,</i> which is sited in the same town as the hospital, has taken up the cudgels and asked the people who wished to have the hospital retained to sign a petition and return it to the public representatives or the newspaper office.  The response this week has been overwhelming.  Thousands of people have signed the petition and returned it.  A large number were returned to me.  This is an indication of people's concern with regard to his decision to down-grade the hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the working party and their report.  The working party did not envisage a reduction of only four.  The North-Eastern Health Board would never have agreed to Monaghan hospital being down-graded if they had known the situation; naturally they were expecting there would be a large reduction in the number of hospitals.  We met the Minister in a deputation last November, and we were concerned <Col N="725" /> that the Minister did not seem to be aware of all the factors relating to Monaghan County Hospital.  I would quote from a report of that deputation to the following meeting of the Advisory Health Committee:</P>
    <P>The members of the Committee who met the Minister reported on the meeting.  Some felt that the meeting had been useful and that the case they had made would influence the Minister in his decision on the location of the General Hospital. Others felt that nothing had been gained by meeting him.  All expressed concern that the Minister was under the impression that the Monaghan members of the Health Board had voted in favour of the recommendations of the Working Party.</P>
    <P>In actual fact, they had voted against them.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>The Committee decided to write to the Minister and set the record straight on this matter... They also considered that the Working Party had not spent sufficient time considering the needs of the Monaghan area and the advantages it possessed for development of a general hospital complex...</P>
    <P>Again in regard to the working party's recommendations to the Minister, the report says:</P>
    <P>The Board also agreed that the Chairman when replying to the Tánaiste's letter of 9th October, 1973, should ask the Minister to fully define the role of County Hospital in the area which would not be developed into a General Hospital prior to announcing his decision in the matter.  Monaghan and Navan were mentioned specifically in this regard.</P>
    <P>The working party had hoped that before announcing his decision the Minister would have communicated with them and defined the role of the county hospital, but he did not do that.</P>
    <P>To get back to Monaghan Hospital, the Minister referred to the 30-mile radius.  If you look at the maps for the general proposals for hospitals you will find that the 30-mile radius was adhered to only when it suited. <Col N="726" /> Monaghan town is on the very tip of the 30-mile radius for the proposed general hospital in Cavan, that is, going by the most direct route, by a concession road which over the last number of years has not been used very much because of the danger of hijacking on the road.  The Minister's 30 mile radius is as the crow flies. Such a distance does not apply in hilly, isolated areas where there is no straight route.  The distance from Cavan Hospital to the Monaghan/ Tyrone border by the normal route is 45 miles.  Any alternative routes to those I have already mentioned would be on poor-grade roads.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's statement that Monaghan Hospital is not suitable for extension, and, in fairness, the matter should be examined by professional people.  It is a hospital that was built in the 1930s with 174 beds, structurally sound, and it is one of the largest county hospitals in the country.  All public representatives are anxious that the best possible service be provided for the patients.  It is our main priority, but in the case of Monaghan I believe the matter was not fully examined.  That hospital provides a wide and valuable service in medical, surgical, gyno, maternity, oculist and dental services.  Proposals have already been circulated for the community hospital.  Professional men tell us a community hospital could not operate such services in an area like Monaghan, a town with a large population, which has a hospital and which is recognised as a growth area.  There is in the course of construction a large Army barracks and we expect that, with the Army personnel and their families, we will have an increase in population to the extent probably of 1,500 people.  There are a large number of small factories in the area and it is the largest furniture producing area in Ireland.  This is an industry where there is a high incidence of industrial accidents.  It has been mentioned in regard to other hospitals that they were sited on arterial roads. The same applies to Monaghan.  It is on the main arterial road from Derry to Dublin.  If an accident happened at the Monaghan-Tyrone border, it would be 45 miles away from the proposed <Col N="727" /> general hospital, unless they were going as the crow flies, by helicopter. It is important to have hospitals within easy reach of arterial routes.</P>
    <P>We had the very sad circumstance 18 months ago of a bombing campaign in Monaghan.  On that occasion there were so many people injured that had we not had the county hospital, a very serious situation would have arisen. Coupled with that is the fact that we have a large psychiatric hospital convenient to the county hospital.  It was accepted as ideal that the psychiatric and general hospital should be in close proximity.  Due to the number of patients who can be treated at home and the number of district psychiatric nurses who now cover the area, there was in the last number of years an 18 per cent decrease in the demand for beds in the psychiatric hospital.  Therefore, at present in the psychiatric hospital in Monaghan many people are rated as geriatric patients, and in years to come we certainly will not have such patients occupying beds in a psychiatric hospital.  I would appeal to the Minister not to go ahead with the proposal for a community hospital.  If he does go ahead with it there will be a large number of vacant beds in the psychiatric hospitals plus 174 beds in the present county hospital.</P>
    <P>People may say that the health of the people and hospitalisation cannot be related to finance but the hard facts are that it takes money to initiate, introduce and implement the measures the Minister proposes.  We are talking in terms of £60 million and £65 million.  One immediately has regard to the position of health boards.  It brings to my mind the serious financial position of the health board of which I am a member, the North Eastern Health Board, and the capital projects we have in hand and the slow rate of progress.  To say that the progress is at a snail's pace would be an exaggeration.  The capital projects fall into two categories.  The following projects were outstanding in June, 1975: acute hospital service, psychiatric hospital service, geriatric hospital service, welfare homes, health <Col N="728" /> centres, fire precautions in all institutions. The total estimated cost was £5,052,000.  We draw up a priority list. The works were programmed up to 1980.</P>
    <P>The priority list included fire precaution works, estimated at £275,000; health centre; surgical hospital, Cavan; rewriting of county hospital, Monaghan; new theatre in Navan; replacement of old people's home, Dundalk; provision of pathology laboratory, Our Lady's Hospital, Navan; health centre, Dunleer; second hospital, St. Davnet's; welfare home and community centre, Cavan; kitchens, St. Brigid's, Ardee; under feed stoker, County Hospital, Dundalk; replacement of St. Phelim's Hospital, Cavan; replacement of Rathmullen House, Drogheda; welfare home, Monaghan; redecoration of County Hospital, Dundalk; replacement of St. Mary's Drogheda; administrative buildings and clinic, Dundalk; demolition of old buildings, St. Davnet's, Monaghan; car park and second accidentals, County Hospital, Monaghan; lift at the Hilltop, Dundalk; extension, St. Mary's Day Centre, Castleblaney; recreation centre, St. Davnet's Hospital, Monaghan.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the completion of an out-patients clinic at Monaghan and a welfare home at Drogheda, the works carried out by the North Eastern Health Board were not works of a capital nature.  They were maintenance works and they were matters of urgency.  The works carried out were the heating of St. Joseph's, Ardee, the heating of the Hilltop, Dundalk and the provision of a lift at St. Phelim's, Cavan.  That was the sum total of the projects carried out of a £5 million programme.  At the same time we were extending our overdraft accommodation for the day-to-day running of the institutions, not setting aside any money for capital projects.</P>
    <P>On 15th April, at the health board meeting, the finance officer read the following report:</P>
    <P>At the September meeting the board authorised the usual overdraft accommodation of £1.1 million for the three months to 31st December, 1974.  Substantial arrears of grants were due to the board and in anticipation <Col N="729" /> of payments on foot of these arrears the sum authorised by the board was quite adequate.</P>
    <P>On 19th November, 1974, however, the limit of £1.1 million was exceeded, the excess reaching its highest point&mdash;£97,360&mdash;on 29th November, 1974, after which the overdraft dropped to £807,000.</P>
    <P>At the meeting on 16th December, 1974, the board was again asked to authorise overdraft of £1.1 million for the three months to 31st March, 1975, and it was then assumed that payments on foot of arrears would be made almost immediately.  This did not happen and on the 24th December last the limit was again exceeded and our overdraft on 30th December last reached £1,221,200 and continued to rise until it reached £1,549,900 on 29th January, 1975 when an instalment of grant of £800,000 was received.</P>
    <P>The next peak point was 26th February last when £1,631,800 was reached.  Following receipt of a grant of £900,000, of which £200,000 represented arrears, the position improved for a short period but the limit was again exceeded on 4th March.</P>
    <P>Until we are informed of the timing of arrears payments it is impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy the level of overdraft which we will require at any given time.</P>
    <P>Our overdraft as of yesterday was £1,913,000 and in view of this we will require an additional £1,000,000 to cover the current quarter.</P>
    <P>That means that there was an increase in a little over a 12-month period from £1.1 million to £2.9 million.  That was for the day-to-day administration of the health services in a four-county health board area. We now talk about downgrading a hospital and spending £60 million&mdash; wherever that could be secured.</P>
    <P>The guidelines for community hospitals have been referred to.  It would appear that the Minister's proposal is that medical cover for the community hospitals would be provided <Col N="730" /> by the local general practitioners. It is doubtful if those guidelines in regard to the staffing of the hospitals would be accepted by the medical association.  The guidelines have been published and there has been no consultation between the general practitioners and the Minister on this matter.</P>
    <P>No. 5 of the guidelines is as follows:</P>
    <P>5.1.  The medical staff responsible for day-to-day care of patients should be general practitioners working in co-operation with the area consultants in accordance with an agreed policy (see paragraphs 4.2 and 4.3.). Appropriate arrangements for the medical administration of the hospital will be required.</P>
    <P>5.2.  All general medical practitioners in the locality should be encouraged to be involved in the community hospital, provided they have had appropriate post-graduate training.  Attendance periodically at post-graduate refresher courses should be a condition of participation in the community hospital.</P>
    <P>5.3.  General practice training schemes might include a period of training with a general practitioner who works in a community hospital.</P>
    <P>5.4.  While it is not expected that community hospitals will need to have resident medical staff, it is essential that, one way or another, there should be continuous on-call cover.</P>
    <P>That must rule out a community hospital for Monaghan because some of the areas to be covered are 45 miles from the general hospital.  There will be no consultants in that hospital, only general practitioners.  Patients would have to hope that those general practitioners would be available when needed and we all know the difficulty of getting general practitioners at times. Even the Garda who must call on a doctor in the course of their work find it virtually impossible to get one.  If there is such difficulty in contacting a general practitioner, I do not see how it would be possible for them to staff <Col N="731" /> a community hospital.  According to the proposals of the Minister, we will not have an anaesthetist at the hospital and this will create a problem as far as dentistry is concerned.  Dentists will be impeded in their work if there is no anaesthetist.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have another look at his proposals in relation to Monaghan County Hospital. The Minister told us that there was a demand for a general hospital for Cavan and for a similar hospital for Monaghan and he had to decide between the two centres.  I appeal to him to allow the county hospital in Monaghan continue at its present standard.  While I accept that it would take many years to implement the Minister's proposals, there is a danger that a hospital which is scheduled for down-grading will be condemned and will find it almost impossible to recruit staff.  I should like the Minister to bear all these facts in mind when reconsidering this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry) Richard Barry">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the case made by Deputy Leonard with regard to Monaghan County Hospital and I should like to assure him that I will convey his views to the Minister.  A question in relation to the decisions of the Western Health Board was raised this morning and the Minister mentioned that the decisions were not contentious.  For the record I should like to outline the Government's proposals in this regard.  The working group for the area put forward three possible solutions which would satisfy the guidelines:</P>
      <P>(a)  a regional teaching hospital at Galway, a hospital at Castlebar and a third hospital comprising a federation of Portiuncula (Ballinasloe) and Roscommon hospitals;</P>
      <P>(b)  a regional teaching hospital at Galway, a hospital at Castlebar and a hospital at Ballinasloe;</P>
      <P>(c)  a regional teaching hospital at Galway, a hospital at Castlebar and a hospital at Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working party in their report indicated that solution (a) attracted <Col N="732" /> most support although uncertainty had been expressed regarding the practicability of federating two hospitals which were 28 miles apart with poor communication between them. It was felt, however, that this solution should be tried to see if it would work in practice.  With regard to solutions (b) and (c), the working group felt that they had major disadvantages in so far as a sizeable portion of the population in the eastern part of the area would not be within a 30-mile radius of a hospital centre as laid down in the Comhairle guidelines.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the demographic features in the area, the distance involved and the poor road communication, made it extremely difficult to service the population from a single hospital centre, either Roscommon or Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board and the three county health advisory committees have agreed with solution (a). The Galway Regional Hospital Board recommended solution (a) and they considered also that the practicability of the federation between Roscommon and Portiuncula be reviewed within a period of two years.  That board recommended that, if the federation should prove impracticable, consideration then be given to the provision of an acute general hospital in Ballinasloe or Roscommon or Athlone.  Comhairle na nOspidéal recommended solution (b).  They did not feel that the federation was a practicable proposition and that the fragmentation involved of the minimum hospital services necessary for the area would be undesirable from the medical organisational viewpoint. Deputations from Roscommon and Ballinasloe were received by the Minister and they discussed the proposed federation.</P>
    <P>The Minister carefully considered various views expressed.  He notes that the authorities of the two hospitals&mdash;the Western Health Board for Roscommon and the Franciscan Missionaries of Divine Motherhood for Portiuncula&mdash;are willing to operate this federation.  He agrees, therefore, that it should operate, but that its working should be reviewed <Col N="733" /> after a trial period, bearing in mind the recommendations of the Galway Regional Hospital Board.  The Minister also has approved of the continued development of Galway as a regional hospital centre and of the development of Castlebar as a general hospital.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to make those views clear because I assisted the Minister when he received deputations from those areas.  It is our belief that these proposals should be reviewed.  With regard to the proposed federation between Cork and Mallow hospitals, I am convinced that that is the correct solution and that the situation can be reviewed in time with regard to that federation.  Those who come after us may decide to change this programme but it should be remembered that this simply is a development plan.  Deputy Connolly is anxious to tear the Minister and myself asunder but the Deputy knows that I visited Tullamore Hospital more than once and that I visited Mullingar on more than one occasion.</P>
    <P>I was in in Portlaoise more than once.  What I have done is not a blueprint for the future, it is a start.  It is my personal belief that what is in print here today will guide us all tomorrow. Will you not give it a chance, because this is what the people want? Did the Deputies hear the figures mentioned here this morning?  The blueprint for the future will cost £65 million.  It was mentioned that the Cork Wilton Hospital, from the planning stage to its completion, took eight-and-a-half years.  It is my hope that our plan will reduce that time to four years so that we can have a decent service and standard for our people.</P>
    <P>May I take this opportunity of saying how much I appreciate the work done in the different hospitals and institutions throughout the country by all the staff, from the highest to the lowest.  Deputy H. Byrne, when speaking of the staff in hospitals, left out a most important section&mdash;the domestic staff, the people in the kitchens and those who do the washing and the laundry.  In my view, due recognition is not given to these people.  I want to <Col N="734" /> put on the record of this House my appreciation of the good work these people do, not forgetting the nurses, doctors, consultants and para-medicals.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy Connolly, in anticipation of what I am about to hear: do not lose your head.  You can always come to the Minister for Health or to myself, because we have nothing sinister in our minds for Tullamore, Mullingar or Portlaoise. We will help in any way we can.  With regard to the future of Tullamore Hospital let me assure the Deputy that I, personally, will make sure that it will be looked after, as I promised 18 months ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate gives me a welcome opportunity to air my views on this hospital plan and I want to go on record, with Deputy Haughey, in rejecting it.  The region I come from will get nothing compared with the other regions.  I do not want the Parliamentary Secretary to think I am going to fleece him or anybody else because at all times my relations with all the Members of this House have been above board.</P>
      <P>The midland region is getting two mini-scale hospitals.  &ldquo;Mini-scale&rdquo; in my opinion is short and nobody has denied that because I sought clarification from a number of professional people who know what mini-hospitals are.  When the FitzGerald Report came out that, in my opinion, was the ideal plan for the country.  I do not mind where a regional hospital is erected as long as it is erected in the region.  I want to put that on record because I would not like anybody to think I was plugging only for my own county.  What we are getting now is a fragmentation of the services.  This is what I call an underdevelopment plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The midland region, comprising Offaly, Westmeath and Longford, has a population of 178,000 but gets no full scale general hospital, while the south eastern region, with a population of 328,000, gets four approximately 30 miles apart, if my geography is correct.  In July, 1973, the Midland Health Board, by a vote of 13 to nil, decided that the board <Col N="735" /> should proceed with plans to build a general hospital and that the existing hospital complexes be retained and improved to meet existing needs.  This appeared to be a major step forward in fulfilling their obligation to the people of the midland health region. In January, 1974, that was rescinded and two mini-hospitals were introduced.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's report it is stated that Portlaoise and Mullingar hospitals will deal with certain specialities. From that, I understand that a person from Laois may have to go to Mullingar for a certain type of treatment or a person from the far end of Longford may have to go to Portlaoise for another kind of treatment.  Will this not bring about a major transport problem as well?  The transport costs of the Midland Board are alarming at the moment.</P>
    <P>Here we have a fragmentation of services in the region.  Nobody can explain to me why we have not got a general hospital.  All the others have, and some of them have got four.  The Minister states that his aim is not to bring any patient more than 30 miles to a hospital.  In the case of the midland region the distance is as much as 70 miles.  Of course, it is well known that political decisions have to be made and I suppose that is now the kernel of our problems.</P>
    <P>It will take at least 15 years to implement the Minister's plan which Deputy Byrne condemned.  What will happen to the county hospital at Tullamore?  Let us have a look at its history.  It was opened in 1941 and originally the accommodation was 80 beds.  A nurses' home was built in the 1950s and it freed the ground floor bringing the bed complement up to 125.  There were 100 beds added in 1972, a large geriatric unit.  Twelve of these beds were supposed to form an assessment department.  The total bed complement now is 225, not 127 as the Minister reported in October. That is three fewer then there are in the Sligo County Hospital and more than in many county hospitals.  The Minister said in the report that it is not easy to add accommodation to the <Col N="736" /> Tullamore Hospital, but the front lawn comprises 4½ acres approximately and there is an area of 15 acres, plus 5 optional acres at the rear.  That argument in the report does not stand up.  Deputy Haughey asked what will happen to the hospital we have.  There is nothing in the county but despair, shock, amazement and gloom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another day's work.  The truth hurts.  I am laying it on the line.  If the personnel we have in the county hospital decide to go into retirement or otherwise, will it not be very hard to replace them?  Will anybody go to a hospital over which there is a cloud? Nobody can get away from the fact that we have been down-graded.  The people in Offaly and in the midland region in general are not foolish enough to think otherwise.  There are no fools in Offaly, never were, and they know this new phrase &ldquo;community hospital&rdquo; is just a slight improvement on what is better known as a convalescent home.</P>
      <P>When the Tullamore hospital came into operation in 1941 there were one surgeon, one physician, a matron, house doctor, radiographer and nine nurses.  We have gone a long way since.  In the past five years nearly £½ million has been spent on that hospital and it would be a crying shame if that were to be down-graded and turned into a community hospital or convalescent home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at that hospital today. Deputy Enright knows well the amount of work Offaly County Council had done there before the Midland Health Board came into existence.  He knows all the trouble we went to to get improvements in the hospital.  At the moment there are one surgeon, one relief surgeon, one physician, one geriatrician, one gynaecologist, one relief gynaecologist, <Col N="737" /> two radiologists, a surgical registrar, three junior house surgeons, seven junior house physicians, one anaesthetist, one paediologist, 102 nurses and a number of others who give to the community of Offaly an excellent service.  There are also a number of outside consultants coming to that hospital, such as an ear, nose and throat surgeon, an eye specialist, orthopaedic surgeons and a number of others in the dental field. The Parliamentary Secretary may say it is all right for me to get up and blow my coal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying he said it but he anticipated that I would lambaste him.  We find it very difficult to understand how we are being completely by-passed in regard to a general hospital.  At page 125, the FitzGerald Report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Central Midlands areas there are at present the county hospitals in Portlaoise, Tullamore, and Mullingar.  All these hospitals are modern buildings, they are comparable in size and the towns in which they are located are also comparable in size.  The three towns are situated on a line running roughly south to north: Tullamore is 20 miles north of Portlaoise while Mullingar is 22 miles north of Tullamore.  In our consideration of this area it was clear to us that the development of General Hospitals in more than one of these centres would be difficult to justify.  In considering the merits of the different centres we had regard to the impact of our selection on the areas to the north and to the south. If, for example, Portlaoise was to be developed as a General Hospital centre it would infringe on the area which one would expect might be served by Waterford General Hospital while Mullingar, if chosen for development, might be expected to draw patients from Cavan without adequately catering for the Cavan/ Monaghan area.  The situation of Tullamore roughly half-way between Mullingar and Portlaoise, <Col N="738" /> reasonably close to both and centrally located in relation to the entire area now served by the three hospitals, gives it, we feel, a stronger claim for development as a main hospital centre.</P>
    <P>It does not state in that report that Tullamore was unsuitable for extension or additional accommodation. Actually, we have land in Tullamore on which we could build one of the most modern major hospitals in Europe.  The man who drew up this plan is an eminent medical man, Professor FitzGerald: nobody can deny that.  As I see it, if clarification is not given by the Minister in regard to the future role of Tullamore County Hospital we shall be in a quandary in the midland region.</P>
    <P>What we resent is the downgrading of that hospital because that is what the Minister's report means, the report issued last October.  Community hospitals as we know them and as we are led to believe from the discussion document of Comhairle na nOspidéal on the role of the smaller hospitals will have no anaesthetist and no surgeon and will be attended mainly by GPs.  According to reports in Europe and here, no surgery will be carried out and consultants will only be called into these community hospitals to advise.  If the patient needs surgery he will have to be transferred elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In a report in the <i>Medical Times</i> and in the <i>Irish Independent</i> it is stated that Comhairle na nOspidéal were unhappy with some of the decisions made by the Minister and that he had by-passed their recommendations.  I have no doubt that in some areas he did by-pass them.  That is what I would call political manoeuvring.  Since this report came out, the people of Laois and some of the leading medical men in Longford and Westmeath are not all happy now because they see what they will get and&mdash;let us be honest about it&mdash;they will get nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is what the people get that matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and if the Department and the Government had decided that the region would have got a <Col N="739" /> general hospital which would be able to care for all the needs of the community and we would still have a large extern hospital accommodation.  In other words, patients that cannot be catered for in the local hospitals, those needing specialised treatment will still have to go outside the area to the Dublin hospitals.  Is that not what it means?</P>
      <P>I should like to elaborate on transport costs to which I referred earlier. It will now be very costly to bring patients from Longford to Portlaoise and from Graiguecullen to Mullingar which may happen because the Minister states that in the midland region they will be dealing with certain specialities.  This could mean a number of things.  I should like to know if both hospitals will work in co-operation with one another.  Will one have one service which the other has not?  Will there be overlapping of services?  These are some of the problems that arise.  If that is the case, we shall have enormous transport costs, as I see it. Let there be no doubt about that.  The people of Offaly have recently shown their anger and fury over the decision taken because they realise the service that particular hospital has given down through the years.  On 21st October last, when the announcement was made, they realised they were no longer going to have a hospital which would give specialist treatment because the hospital was being down-graded.</P>
      <P>There are two ways of killing a hospital.  When bad news breaks people decide to get out before things get worse.  The anaesthetist leaves and a replacement cannot be found.  The surgeon decides to go and the gynaecologist likewise.  That is only human nature.  No one will wait until the key is actually turning in the door and there is no longer a job.  At the moment I believe there are people trying to lure some of our personnel away.  In doing that they are doing Offaly a grave injustice.  I shall not be slow in naming them and bringing them to the notice of the people of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision made by the Midland Health Board to retain the hospitals <Col N="740" /> we have plus a general hospital was the right and proper decision to make. The decision made the following year will only result in putting the region back to where it was at the beginning of the 19th century.  That is how I see it.  We all know the financial situation of the nation.  We are almost bankrupt.  The Government are borrowing everywhere they can to keep the wheels just turning. In the light of that situation I cannot see any of this so-called plan being implemented for a long time to come. However, the hospitals that have a cloud over them are in trouble because, as a result of certain publicity, a serious situation could result.  There is need for clarification about Tullamore.</P>
    <P>Last week, in reply to a question, the Minister told me the decision in regard to the midland region was the final plan.  There would be no going back. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, now occupying the front bench, to convey to the Minister the views not alone of Offaly but of the whole midland region.  The situation at the moment is bad for morale because no one knows exactly what will happen and how soon.  People ask me if extra accommodation will be built in Portlaoise. There is nothing to that effect in the plan.</P>
    <P>Earlier I was dealing with political decisions.  In any area where there was a likelihood of controversy that area was put on the long finger.  The Minister said such areas would have to be reviewed again, areas such as Tipperary, Cork and Limerick.  However, as far as Laois-Offaly and Longford-Westmeath were concerned there was nothing to worry about but the people in the midland region are not prepared to accept the secondhand treatment being meted out to them under this plan.  How can I and my colleagues explain to our constituents why we are not getting a general hospital while other regions can get no fewer than four of them?  The midland region will be in a dire situation.  The horizon is black with clouds.  Nothing in the document holds out any hope for the immediate future.  As I see it, we will have an overlapping of services in the <Col N="741" /> two mini-scale hospitals, whenever they come into being.  I say &ldquo;whenever&rdquo;. The people of Offaly will not mind where a general hospital is erected provided it is in the midland region. The people I represent expect the best possible treatment wherever that is available and wherever the hospital is situated.  All the medical men seem to think that these central hospitals, where all the needs of the people can be looked after, are the most viable as far as patients are concerned.  That being so, I cannot understand the treatment we have received in the midlands region.  It warrants explanation. Possibly some of its motives were political. If they were, I say &ldquo;God help us; we have put politics before the health of our people&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We oppose this plan but, when one opposes something, one should be able to offer a constructive alternative. Certainly, we on this side of the House would not come up with the kind of plan now presented by the Minister and the Government.  That should be made known and further, the people of the midlands region would not expect us to introduce such a plan.  Any man who votes for that plan now will find when he goes back to his constituency that his constituents will deal with him in no uncertain manner.  The people of Offaly are not seeking charity from anyone; they are looking for the fairplay to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before this debate concludes I hope the Minister will clarify some points I put forward; also that he may be able to confirm that the County Hospital in Tullamore will not be down-graded in any shape or form.  Indeed, I should not like to see Portlaoise Hospital being down-graded or Mullingar either, and I presume my colleagues would not like to see that happen.  I want to place on record that the decision made in July, 1973, by the Midland Hospital Board was the correct one for that region.  It was not <Col N="742" /> stated in that decision where the hospital was to be erected.  That decision also stipulated that our present hospitals should be retained.</P>
    <P>In view of the current financial situation&mdash;and we must be practical about it&mdash;there is no point in introducing a plan if there are no financial resources with which to implement it, which there are not.  It is mere paper work.</P>

      <P>I worry about what will be the future.  Remember there is such a thing as morale.  When one's morale is shattered as it could be from a reading of that plan, where does one go?  It would be interesting to see how the Deputy would explain that.  This plan may not be implemented for anything up to 15 years.  What will happen in Tullamore where there is overcrowding in the wards, especially in the maternity, surgical and children's wards?  Since we have not now got the financial resources to do what we would like, we should be improving our existing facilities in Portlaoise, Mullingar and Tullamore. That would be of some help and could be implemented at little expense.</P>
      <P>Let us face facts on how we are faring out from a financial point of view in regard to all of this.  We had an old folks' home in Edenderry, for which we could not find the money. The same applied in Tullamore. Therefore, it is pointless for us to introduce marvellous paper plans if we are unable to implement them within a few years, not taking 15 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like some clarification of the present economic position from the Government and the Tánaiste in view of the fact that we are unable to put any of this plan into motion now in the Midlands region.  With the more acute needs existing in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and possibly other areas as well, they will absorb all of the finances, if any, available.</P>
      <P>Therefore the sensible thing for the Department of Health and the Government to do would be to improve our present facilities.  That could be done, let us say, every three years. Again, one might say that that is piecemeal.  But one must act in accordance with one's financial resources and one cannot promise hospitals&mdash;regional, general or anything else one likes to call them&mdash;if one has nothing with which to build them.  Let us be honest; we have not a &ldquo;tosser&rdquo; to build anything.  That is the situation.  We are not likely to have much finance available unless there is a change of Government, when the position will likely improve. Some improvement should be carried out to the three hospitals in the midland region to relieve overcrowding. The medical men in those hospitals know the facts better than I do and should be able to come up with a plan to meet the needs of the people there.  If something is not done there will be a steady slowing down and suddenly a person will be told he cannot go to a particular hospital because there is nobody there to operate on him and he must go to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that, because we are not able to go ahead with this plan, ten years could become twenty years and <Col N="744" /> there will be many changes.  We should go ahead with improvements to the three hospitals in the midland region&mdash;Mullingar, Portlaoise and Tullamore&mdash;so that we can give a service to the people.  We may not be able to deal with all the chronic cases but we will have to put up with that until more money becomes available. I hope the Minister will bear my remarks in mind.  I did not mean to be personal in any way.</P>
    <P>One can imagine how the people in the region feel because they see what they are likely to get.  I believe they will get nothing more than the existing hospitals maintained and a guarantee that they will be there.  If we were provided with a general hospital it would deal with everything, but what we are being given will continue to create a problem for the region and a large number of patients will have to go to outside hospitals.  I hope the Minister will look again at the Midland Health Board region to see if he can bring about a satisfactory solution to the great problem we have in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this to be a highly important debate.  It deals with plans for the hospital services for the country.  I believe I will be exchanging my ideas with the Minister's in regard to those hospital services.  I have read the Minister's statement very carefully and I have read his general hospital development plan.  I believe this plan has received wide approval throughout the country.  There has been widespread support for the Minister, with some exceptions, in regard to these proposals.  I believe my health board area is an exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall put forward some ideas which I ask the Minister to fully consider. I also ask every member of the staff of his Department to listen with the greatest interest to what I have to say and afterwards to consider in full what I have said.  Some reconsideration of the hospital services proposed for the Midland Health Board area should take place.  The Fitzgerald Report dealt with general hospitals and recommended that a general hospital would have, approximately, 300 <Col N="745" /> beds.  The report set out the type of services that would be provided in those hospitals.  Those services would consist of three consultant physicians, two pathologists, two radiologists, three physicians, three surgeons, two obstetrician gynaecologists and three anaesthetists and those consultants would have the support of the junior hospital staff.  There would also be participation by medical students and there would be a training complex for the nursing staff.</P>
    <P>The Fitzgerald Report decided on a general hospital for the Midland Health Board area at Tullamore. Once Tullamore was accepted it was believed that many services would be retained at their present level in Mullingar and Portlaoise.  The Midland Health Board unanimously passed the following resolution on 26th July, 1973:</P>
    <P>That the Board proceed with plans to build a general hospital and that the existing hospital complexes be retained and improved to meet existing needs.</P>
    <P>This resolution was unanimously adopted.  Subsequently the Minister decided to change the guideline and to bring the scale of distance from the hospital to within a radius of 30 miles.  Following this change a decision was taken by the health board which resulted in the original decision of the 26th July, 1973, being rescinded. This decision was rescinded on Tuesday, 29th January, 1974, at a meeting of the Midland Health Board held in the boardroom in Tullamore. This decision was carried by 19 votes to 7.  Following this on that day a decision was taken on the following resolution:</P>
    <P>That the Board accept the recommendation contained in the Working Party Report of 6th November, 1973, that two minimum-scale hospital units be located at Mullingar and Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>This resulted in 19 people voting for two minimum-scale hospital units to be located at Mullingar and Portlaoise. Nobody voted against the motion.  A number of people abstained, and it is recorded in the <Col N="746" /> minutes of that meeting of 29th January, 1974 that they asked:</P>
    <P>That it be recorded that the members who abstained from voting did so on the grounds that sufficient information was not available as to what constituted a minimum-scale hospital.</P>
    <P>We have since got some idea of what a minimum scale hospital is.  I believed at the time the Fitzgerald Report was published that it offered the best solution for the Midland Health Board area in that it provided a really large-scale hospital and all the services I have mentioned.  The health board decided that they would change and they did change.  The best possible decision may have been to have one general hospital.  Now two minimum scale hospitals have been proposed.  I am firmly of the opinion that a general hospital would be the best solution while retaining the existing services in the other two hospitals.</P>
    <P>I should like to go through the guidelines laid down by the Minister. I believe they are highly important. They were completed in September, 1973.  They modified the earlier recommendations and proposed that:</P>
    <P>The general aim should be to organise acute hospital services so that the population served would be within a radius of 30 miles of the hospital centre.</P>
    <P>In regard to this guideline I would ask the Minister to take special note of some of the areas which do not come within a 30 mile radius.  The town of Birr, where I reside, and the village of Shinrone, where I was born and reared, do not come within this radius.  The town of Birr is 45 miles from Mullingar and 40 miles from Portlaoise.  This is a town of 4,000 people.  Another guideline was that:</P>
    <P>The minimum staff of such an acute hospital should consist of two consultant surgeons and two consultant physicians with other consultant medical personnel and other staff as required by the caseload.</P>
    <P>The existing hospital in Tullamore has two surgeons working in conjunction with each other.  The same <Col N="747" /> situation obtains in regard to physicians and there are other consultant medical personnel.</P>
    <P>The population of the Midland Health Board area by 1986 is expected to be 215,000.  The Minister's third guideline is that:</P>
    <P>Where there were special considerations such as low density, a lower figure would be appropriate, ranging down to 75,000 in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the three hospitals are maintained and improved the situation will come within those criteria.  I would venture to suggest that we should have a federation of the three hospitals of Tullamore, Portlaoise and Mullingar in the area at present, such as is proposed for Ballinasloe and Roscommon.  I believe this would satisfy all the criteria laid down in the Minister's guidelines.  It would mean that we would be within the 30 mile radius, we would have the appropriate staff and we would have the minimum population density. There are exceptional circumstances in regard to the Slieve Bloom Mountains, very bad bog roads and low population density in many areas. Therefore, the area would qualify under all three headings.</P>
    <P>In order to show clearly that we would not be any different from any of the other health board areas I want to point out that the other health board areas all have a number of general hospitals which will be working in conjunction with one another.  The South Eastern Health Board area comprises the counties of Carlow, Kilkenny, south Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford.  The projected population in 1986 is 399,000 and there will be four general hospitals: a general hospital in Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford and south Tipperary. This represents less than 100,000 population per hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>80,000, to be exact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important figure to bear in mind.  The North Western Health Board area comprises the counties of Donegal, Sligo and <Col N="748" /> Leitrim.  The projected population in 1986 is 188,000.  There are two general hospitals proposed for the area, one at Letterkenny and one at Sligo.  That represents 94,000 people per hospital.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Barry, dealt with the Western Health Board in some detail.  That area comprises the counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  The projected population for 1986 is 345,000.  There will be a general hospital in Castlebar, a regional hospital in Galway and a federation of Roscommon and Ballinasloe which to all intents and purposes would be a general type hospital for the two areas.  That means there will be three general hospitals and a regional hospital for a population of 345,000, representing 86,000 persons per hospital and four hospitals for three counties.</P>
      <P>Another region worthy of mention is the north-eastern region which comprises the counties Cavan, Louth, Meath and Monaghan.  The projected population in 1986 is 304,000.  This population will be serviced by a general hospital in Dundalk, a general hospital at Dundalk, a general hospital at Navan and there will be the retention and development of the orthopaedic unit at Navan, which will approximate to a very large hospital and is regarded as being in the same category as a general hospital.  This means that there will be four-largescale hospitals in the north-eastern region.  This represents a ratio of 76,000 persons per hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures help to emphasise that the Midland Health Board area should be able to utilise the services of three general hospitals.  There are very long distances involved over the four counties, running from Longford through Westmeath, Laois and Offaly. On those figures it is possible to prove that the Midland Health Board area should qualify for the retention of the three existing hospitals and their being updated to the category of general hospital.  This is a reasonable argument because the projected population in that area for 1986 is 258,000.  This comes within paragraph 3 of the guidelines as laid down by the Minister. As I said earlier, at present, with <Col N="749" /> the staff working in conjunction with one another, the retention of Tullamore Hospital for the present unit is merited.  I have explained that with the two hospitals as proposed there will be a very large number of persons who will not be adequately served and who will not come within the 30 mile radius laid down by the Minister. In my view the area qualifies for three general hospitals under all of the guidelines laid down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's proposals and his general hospital development plan there is one item which has been causing some worry to me personally and to persons situated in the Midland Health Board area.  I refer to the Minister's statement where he says:</P>
    <P>The difference in the range of work which could be done in one hospital at Tullamore as against two at, say, Mullingar and Portlaoise would not be very great.  If these two hospitals are retained and developed, it would be expected that they would work together and that each would concentrate on certain specialities.</P>
    <P>The point I wish to make is that these two hospitals, 44 miles apart, are expected to work together.  What specialities will be carried on in Mullingar and in Portlaoise?  It appears that there will be an exchange between the two hospitals but I do not see how that will be possible.  It will be difficult for the two hospitals to work in conjunction with each other being that distance apart.  It would present unbelieveable problems for the medical personnel and hardship in the long term on the patients and those wishing to visit them.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister informed us that a federation had been arranged between Roscommon and Ballinasloe hospitals but he also told the House that they are but 23 miles apart.  He also informed us that this federation would be for a trial period of two years.  There appears to be some doubt in regard to the federation of Ballinasloe and Roscommon hospitals and if there is a doubt about hospitals 23 miles apart being able to <Col N="750" /> provide a proper service it appears that it would be nigh impossible for hospitals 45 miles apart to work a federation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of my thinking in this regard and he will take due cognisance of my contribution. He will weigh up everything I have said.</P>
      <P>I suggest a federation of the three hospitals involved, Portlaoise, Tullamore and Mullingar.  The Portlaoise hospital is 22 miles from Tullamore and Mullingar hospital is 22 miles from Tullamore.  It should also be remembered that the Midland Health Board have their offices in Tullamore.  The ideal solution would be to have a federation of the three hospitals and this would be in accordance with the guidelines.  We have the nucleus of an excellent service for the people served by the Midland Health Board.</P>
      <P>In Tullamore hospital there are 227 beds and the Fitzgerald Report recommended that that hospital should be a 300 bed unit.  It would not cost the taxpayer very much to enlarge that hospital to cater for 300 beds.  I believe the Minister will bear this important factor in mind when considering this matter again.  Tullamore has the largest hospital outside Dublin catering for surgical, medical, maternity, paedriatic and geriatric cases.  We must also consider the difficulty involved in relation to traffic accidents.  People involved in such accidents will be placed in an impossible position because they will not know which hospital to go to for treatment.</P>

This figure represents 8.47 per cent of the FEOGA money received by Ireland in respect of that period.  I should point out, however, that the figure I have given does not represent the full amount of the MCAs charged because in a number of cases the MCAs were offset against export refunds and accession compensatory amounts due to traders.

      <P>The present United Kingdom variable premium arrangements are authorised up to 29th February next only and it is not possible to say at this stage what premium arrangements will apply in the 1976-77 marketing year.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that I am very conscious of the possible risks of trade distortion that are inherent in the United Kingdom and other premium systems and I shall be keeping these fully in mind during the price-fixing discussions in the Council of Ministers in the coming months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the main reason for the stability of the cattle trade in Ireland at present is the very existence of the British variable premium? Since the variable premia are payable on exports of meat from the United Kingdom to the mainland of Europe would he also not agree that they would militate against exports of Irish lamb to France because of the domestic support given in the United Kingdom to the production of lamb? Ideally, would it not be best for the Minister to seek a continuation of the application of the variable premium to Ireland on the same terms as the United Kingdom, including exports to France and the EEC generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to pick one's steps as selectively as this when these decisions are being arrived at.  It suits us to have this variable premium as far as our exports to the United Kingdom are concerned.  Some distortion can occur when they have an extra subsidy over and above what we have when exporting to the Continent. At the same time, we have to agree that our exports to the Continent have been very satisfactory for some months past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that our sheep meat exports to the Continent during the past 12 months have been completely upset by the fact the British exported more than four times as much lamb to the <Col N="755" /> French market as we did?  All that 20,000 tons of British lamb which was put on the French market was supported by the variable premium. Would the Minister not agree that the British Government were only allowed by the Commission to maintain the variable premium on condition that it applied to trade between Britain and Ireland?  Is it not logical that it be extended fully to Irish as well as UK exports?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of lamb, there is no common organisation of the market and the British are free to do more or less what they like in that area.  There is not an awful lot we can do about it because it does not come into price-fixing arrangements the same as beef.  We are trying to iron out the lamb problem, regrettably with not a lot of success.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that there is very little interest, apart from that of Ireland, in a common organisation of that market and any member State can veto any proposals we put forward.  Therefore, we have to depend on goodwill and neither the French nor the British are interested in a common organisation of the market.  The French used to be but that outlook has now changed.  My reason for trying very hard for a bilateral arrangement with the French is that I see little prospect of getting a satisfactory common organisation of the market except as part of a price packet that we might have to pay too much for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, having regard to the fact that the European Commission is currently conducting an assessment of the relative value of the existing intervention system and a possible system of deficiency payments, he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Experience over the past couple of years has shown that the existing beef intervention system is not fully effective in supporting producer prices when the market is over-supplied.  A deficiency payments system would be more effective in this respect but it would give rise to very considerable administrative difficulties for most member States, and from the Community point of view would be likely to be far more costly than intervention. In view of the very high proportion of our beef production which is exported, a vital consideration for us is, of course, that any support system should be fully financed by the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the intervention system as far as cattle are concerned has been, from our point of view, a total failure, especially last year?  For that reason, would the Minister not agree that the development of our cattle trade, especially, is absolutely dependent on the producer, and the producer alone, being compensated for depressing drops in the market price, and that the British system, or something like it, in regard to agricultural produce throughout the Community would be better?  The practice and the experience gathered by the UK in the last decade must be of great value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply indicates that a deficiency system would be preferable to a system of intervention if it were paid for totally by the <Col N="757" /> Community.  That is where the big snag exists.  A big snag also exists if in one country you have an intervention system and in another deficiency payments.  The Commission indicated at one stage that if there had been a deficiency system last year the burden would have been intolerable.  If the bottom fell out of the market, as it did in 1974, FEOGA would not be able to meet the cost from the budget provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish cow-herd in June, 1975, was provisionally estimated to have fallen by 4.9 per cent.  No corresponding figures are available for Europe as a whole.  However in EEC countries total cow numbers have declined each year since 1973.  This year the estimated fall is 2.5 per cent.  In the United Kingdom, West Germany and Denmark the percentage decline was 5.6, 2.1 and 2.0 respectively.</P>
      <P>The decline in Irish cow numbers was due primarily to the culling of older animals, large numbers of which had been retained beyond normal herd life during the build-up of the national herd to the record June, 1974, level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fall in the cow herd in Western <Col N="760" /> Europe has been largely due to a rise in the relative prices of feed grains coupled with poor pasture conditions.</P>
    <P>The current market prices for calves, store and fat cattle, the price for milk and the outlook for the next few years justify further expansion of the national cow herd and I am confident that in this situation our farmers will take full advantage of their opportunities.</P>

If a similar scheme were introduced here it would be necessary for the producers to retain the calf for 12 months in this country.  If the Minister did that it would be no longer possible for multi-national companies that are producing tens of thousands of cattle with subsidised maize in northern Italy to come to Ireland and raid our cattle herd as they are doing?</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that the Italian arrangement was for one year only and has to be reviewed at price-fixing time in the coming year. I have given as my opinion&mdash;and I have not given it lightly; I have given it as a result of a good deal of discussion with farmers and farm organisations&mdash;that farmers would not be prepared to accept in substitution for all other aids a calf subsidy similar to the Italian subsidy.</P>

And surely the Minister will be able to point out to <Col N="762" /> the Commission that the very future of the Irish cattle herd is at stake and that the decimation of the Irish herd that is taking place is in no way comparable to what is happening to the herds in the rest of the Community?</P>

      <P>Can the Minister confirm or deny the allegation that has been made that large quantities of Irish beef, having been put into intervention storage in Ireland by Irish firms, were subsequently purchased by the same firms from intervention at a very large discount and thereafter sold to third countries against an export refund?  Is not this the sharpest of sharp practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything wrong about this.  I think we are unnecessarily putting our processors in the dock.  Any country was free to buy this beef out of intervention and if an Irish processor gets a benefit that any European processor would get why deny it to him?  In the long run, will not these benefits come back to Irish producers in the main?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the number of certificates issued to Irish firms for the export of beef to third country markets for which no export refunds were claimed; the quantities for which these certificates were issued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>Applications for the transfer of beef EXIM licences held by various Community traders, including certain Irish meat exporters have been made to my Department and have been acceded to in conformity with Community regulations.</P>
      <P>Since June, 1975, 137 import licences have been issued under the EXIM arrangements to Irish firms which have sent beef to third countries without export refund.  These licences authorised the import of 8,428 tonnes of live cattle and 5,182 tonnes of beef and veal into the Community.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is a common commercial practice in the Community that these transfers should involve payments between the parties concerned. I consider that it is preferable that the benefits of these EXIM transactions should accrue to the Irish meat industry and Irish producers rather than to other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the sale of EXIM <Col N="765" /> licences by Irish firms necessitates the importation into the Community of third country beef which will then go into competition with Irish supplies?  Does he not also accept that there is no question so far as the producers&mdash;of whom I am one&mdash;are concerned of the passing back to the producers of the profit being made from this peculiar practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, is it in the Deputy's eyes preferable that these exports should be taking place in other EEC countries and by other EEC traders rather than Irish traders if there is an advantage to be got from them?  I cannot see that argument at all.  I think it is a good thing that Irish exporters were able to take advantage of the arrangements and export to third countries at the same time and I understand they have made contacts for beef sales in Italy as a result of these arrangements.  It is, I think, fair to say this has enabled them to increase their prices to producers and perhaps the firms which have involved themselves in these arrangements are the firms paying the higher prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is not realistic for the Minister to say the benefits of these transactions are being passed back to the consumers when in the last week the Irish reference price was 2 per cent below that of the United Kingdom and it was only 67 units of account per 100 kilogrammes as against 110 units of account in Italy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In regard to the first part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave on 30th October to similar questions by Deputies Kitt and Leonard.</P>
      <P>The proposals put to the EEC Commission relate, <i>inter alia</i>, to the method of fixing the comparable income and of calculating the earned income of the farm.  These are designed primarily to bring an appreciably greater number of farmers into the development category.  Other changes proposed are aimed at introducing a greater degree of flexibility in applying certain aspects of Directive 159/ 72 and at an improvement in the Community's financial contribution to measures undertaken under the directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

There are the <Col N="774" /> same number of combers employed now and there were 396 removed in the present year.  The Minister has to give his approval within six months to institute proceedings.

I gave very clear and specific instructions to the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture that there were to be no exceptions made whatever.  What the Minister is trying to evade is this, that there is now widespread, wholesale use of scrub bulls.

      <P>Protocol 18 to the Accession Treaty authorises the United Kingdom to import diminishing quantities of butter and cheese&mdash;but not of skim milk powder from New Zealand each year up to and including 1977. The quantities actually imported from <Col N="777" /> New Zealand to date are considerably less than the authorised quotas and I see no prospect of these agreed quotas being modified between now and the end of 1977.  The question of continued access for New Zealand butter after 1977 is, of course, at present under consideration by the Council.  The Irish dairy industry is fully aware of this situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been the practice to give the names of individual recipients of grants or subsidies.</P>
      <P>As regards grants paid direct to farmers, the records kept by my Department do not provide the information sought except in the case of the beef cattle incentive scheme and the extension to the mountain lamb subsidy scheme.  In the first ten months of 1975, the number of persons who received grants in excess of £500 under these two schemes was 703 and 70 respectively.</P>
      <P>In the case of the land project and sheep subsidy grants the task of providing the information sought would involve the examination of a very large number of applications and, as the Deputy will appreciate, would be time-consuming and expensive.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme of cattle headage grants to farmers in severely handicapped areas, the maximum grant payable to any individual applicant is £300.  No grants have so far been paid in respect of joint investment projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payments in respect of storage, freezing, and so on, do not involve grants but represent charges arising <Col N="779" /> out of market intervention.  Subsidy on phosphatic fertilisers is paid to manufacturers, importers and main wholesalers and not direct to farmers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday afternoon I was referring to the impact which this Bill, if it becomes law, will have on the nation and on the people, on the minority in the North of Ireland <Col N="787" /> and, indeed, throughout the world.  I referred to the Sunningdale Agreement and said that this was the only surviving remnant of Sunningdale. The most original and important idea to come out of Sunningdale was the idea of the common law enforcement area.  This envisaged a situation in this island in which every person, regardless of his religious or political beliefs or whether he lived in Belfast or South Kerry, would be guaranteed the same basic civil and religious rights.  It also envisaged that the European Convention on Human Rights should be made a part of the domestic law in Northern Ireland and, indeed, in this Republic and that the police forces in Northern Ireland and in the Republic would operate under the same basic control and that violence and the injustices which gave rise to it would be eliminated side by side. The concept of the common law enforcement area also envisaged the closest possible co-operation between the police force in Northern Ireland and the police force in the Republic, the bringing to justice of perpetrators of outrageous deeds both North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parties at Sunningdale, I believe, were not agreed as to how the common law enforcement area should be established and for that reason a law commission was established to investigate the various alternatives.  Included in the alternatives, I believe, was a proposal to set up an all-Ireland court of justice and with this I would fully agree.  In fact, the commission never considered, nor was advised to consider, the full implications of the establishment of an all-Ireland court. It certainly accepted that the all-Ireland court was a very constructive idea but it declined to consider it on the grounds that it would require an amendment to the Constitution of the Republic.  I believe that such an amendment, if necessary, would be well worth while.  The result is that the commission had to choose between extradition and a scheme proposed in this Bill, neither of which can realise the concept of the common law enforcement area or the all-Ireland court of justice.  Without the <Col N="788" /> court, the whole concept of a common law enforcement area is destroyed and cannot be got off the ground.  It is tragic that the all-Ireland court was dismissed because of the time that would be required to carry through an amendment to the Constitution of this State and yet we have been spending months of Government time in the Seanad and in this House debating this petty and futile Bill which will achieve none of the objectives hoped for at Sunningdale. This I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an all-Ireland court of justice is the real answer to this Bill.  I should like to pose the question I posed last night and I hope the Minister will mention it in his reply to the debate.  It is proposed under the Bill to extend the criminal law of the State to certain acts done in Northern Ireland.  I would ask, why Northern Ireland?  Is it not a fact that if a person from this State should kill a British soldier in Northern Ireland prosecution can be brought within the ambit of this Bill but that if such an event should occur in England the person would not be brought within the ambit of the Bill and, certainly, should such an event occur in any other country in the world the person would not be brought within the ambit of the Bill?  This does not add up.  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about section 11 of the Bill which contemplates that under certain circumstances evidence may be taken in Northern Ireland for the purposes of a trial in this State.  If an accused person is charged in the State with an offence committed in Northern Ireland, all the witnesses, apart from witnesses to matters of procedure such as arrest, will be in Northern Ireland.  In many cases it would appear that all the evidence will be taken outside the State under procedures and rules of evidence which may differ considerably from the procedures and rules of evidence applicable in the Republic. It also appears that the accused will have the right to go to Northern Ireland and be there in the custody of the RUC while evidence against him is being taken.  What person <Col N="789" /> accused on any charge in this State would want to go to the North and hand himself over to the custody of the authorities there while evidence is being taken against him?  It is unlikely that a person charged with a crime of violence committed in Northern Ireland or charged with escaping from custody in the North will voluntarily go to Northern Ireland and place himself in the hands of the authorities from which he may have escaped.  It is extremely unlikely.</P>
    <P>It is not sensible on the part of the Government to suggest that events such as are suggested in the Bill could take place.  It is obvious from the Bill that the accused has the right, with a big question mark after it, to attend the taking of evidence on commission in the North provided that he gives himself up in custody to the Northern police.  To appear to confer a right and then to make it impossible to exercise that right is not to confer a right at all but to impose certain disability because the failure of an accused person to exercise the alleged right may lead to the comment that he had his chance to exercise it and that he failed to do so.  In such circumstances his latter position is far worse than his first.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that should the Bill become law, in these circumstances, all the vital evidence in any case will be taken in the absence of the accused and I suggest that this is entirely contrary to what the people of the country or the people of any country in the free democratic world would want and what the people in this country and in the vast majority of countries would regard as a fair criminal trial. This Bill must fall on that score alone.</P>
    <P>I am also very worried in case the Bill, if enacted into law, would have the effect of reducing respect for our criminal law and might have the opposite effect to the effect the Minister thinks it may have.  It may have the effect of strengthening the hands of those who want to bring all the institutions of Government in the Republic and the North of Ireland into contempt.  This could well be the case.</P>
    <P>I suggested this yesterday afternoon and I have considered the matter very <Col N="790" /> carefully since then and I am still convinced that this could be the effect. I suggest that it is a very serious matter to interfere with the people's respect for the criminal law of the State and this Bill could very well have that very effect.</P>
    <P>We must also recall and bear in mind the fact that while the police force in Northern Ireland remain unreformed and while the harassment of the minority population there continues, judges from the Republic hearing evidence in Northern Ireland for the purposes of section 11 of the Bill will be placed in a very compromising position, a terrible position.  The judges from the Republic will have no power to exercise in the court in Northern Ireland.  They will just sit and listen and will keep their mouths shut.  All they can do is sit in silence and watch while the taking of evidence is conducted by another judge, perhaps, and as I believe, in 99 per cent of cases in the absence of the accused.</P>
    <P>Should such a Bill be introduced in any other country, particularly in the House of Commons in England, there would be an uproar because it would be contrary to the concept of legal justice in England and in the vast majority of the free democratic countries in the world where from time immemorial the Governments of these States have passed laws which applied to the citizens within their own territories and, apart from a few well-known exceptions which are not relevant to this debate, never attempted to make crimes committed outside their own territories offences against the laws of their own countries.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the reasoning behind this tradition was, and is, that it would be unfair and unjust to try a man under, say, English law for an alleged offence committed in a foreign country where conditions might be very different, perhaps a corrupt and dictatorial regime where the accused as a member of a minority was discriminated against because of his religious or political views or where the police force proved to be a sectarian force using inhuman methods of torture to obtain information or a confession or where internment without <Col N="791" /> trial was carried out on a religious basis, or where the majority were allowed arm themselves and assassinate members of the minority.</P>
    <P>To Britain, of course, the existence of such a state is a mere supposition. To us in Ireland it is a reality and comprises six countries under British rule.  The Fianna Fáil Government on numerous occasions pointed out to the world the way in which the legal system there discriminates against the minority.  They went even further and brought a case against the authorities in Northern Ireland to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg alleging the use of torture and inhuman treatment. There is no doubt that these allegations can be proved.  Yet, if this Bill becomes law it can only work if our courts accept evidence obtained by members of the RUC or the British Army operating the same techniques which we are now condemning, and which we are trying to prove in Strasbourg were committed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is drafted on the mistaken premise that all the violence is caused by the minority in the North and that the Republic is crawling with IRA members who are guilty of bombings and murder throughout the North. Both these suppositions are incorrect. A look at the latest assassination figures, particularly during the last six months, will clearly show that the members of the minority are getting a severe belting by the majority supporters. The figures also show that very few of the majority who were involved have been apprehended.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister say that the passing of this Bill will bring those killers to justice?  I would remind him that if there are members of the IRA who are guilty of very serious offences at large in the Republic the Government are to blame because they have powers under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act to arrest and charge members of illegal organisations. The Minister himself, as well as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, opposed to the bitter end the passing of that Act.  Now the Minister for Justice is introducing legislation which I believe is contrary to the <Col N="792" /> Constitution and to legal justice.  This Bill would not be accepted in any parliament of any free democratic country in the world today.</P>
    <P>Will the scope of this Bill enable the Government to deal with members of the British army or the RUC suspected of having committed serious offences in this State?  I remember the case of a young man who, some time ago, was shot by a British soldier for no apparent reason.  The circumstances clearly pointed to murder but a Northern court let the accused off scot free.  Will the passing of this Bill prevent such a thing happening again?  Perhaps the Minister will refer to this in his reply.</P>
    <P>Will this Bill make it any easier to bring to justice the people responsible for the bombing in Dublin Airport, if we know who they are, if we have an idea of the organisation to which they belong, if they are resident in the North and arrested there?  If I read the Bill correctly, such people cannot be tried here unless they consent to such a course.  What man in his right mind will consent to be tried here when he knows he can have a trial before his own judge in the North and get off scot free?  This is very relevant to this debate.</P>
    <P>This is bad legislation.  It is unconstitutional. I am surprised at the Minister and the Government introducing such legislation.  It would have been better if the Government had, when the strikes in the North wrecked a democratically elected assembly there, openly condemned them but the Taoiseach or the Government did not do that.  They should have told the world that we wanted a democratically elected institution operating there and we did not want the strikers to bring it down.  Where was our great liberal, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, at that time?  The Taoiseach appeared to be afraid and kept his mouth shut. What he was afraid of I do not know. The Minister for Justice, too, was afraid to speak openly and tell the world that we wanted a democratically elected institution operating in the North.</P>
    <P>I believe this Government have no interest whatsoever in the people of the six north-eastern counties and this <Col N="793" /> Bill proves it.  The actions of this Government during the past two-and-a-half years show clearly that they have no interest in the minority in the North nor in the majority.  Fianna Fáil are interested in the minority in the North and in the majority.  We believe the only way to unite this country is to reunite the people.  This is the policy we will pursue.  It will not be fulfilled by implementing and putting on our statute book this legislation which I believe is unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>Before remarking on certain disturbing aspects of this Bill, I should like it to be understood that my raising these doubts should not be taken as an indication that I have moved even one inch away from my consistently negative appraisal of the activities of terrorist groups.  I maintain, and have always maintained, that these mindless acts of terrorism and indiscriminate violence serve only to expose the perpetrators of these deeds as depraved fanatics.  They debase their ostensibly noble and lofty ideals by resorting to these sub-human attacks on individuals.  These men of violence have displayed a sub-human understanding of the basic human right, the right to live, and as such I could not and never will condone their attacks.  I remain unconvinced of the political nature of these acts and I continue to condemn them as anti-social expressions of primitive people regardless of the fact of whether they occur on our own doorstep, in Northern Ireland or in Britain.  So, I would expect and hope that my comments on this Bill will be given a calm and a rational evaluation on their own merits.</P>
      <P>I do not subscribe to the rather questionable assumption that there are only two sides to an issue and that if you voice any criticism of one position your support must obviously lie in the enemy camp.  This sort of &ldquo;you are with us or you are with them&rdquo; mentality, I think, is corrupt and demagogic especially when it is used to attack the credibility of reasoned and constructive criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking in an attempt to draw the attention of the Chair to <Col N="794" /> some doubts that have arisen in my mind about this Bill.  These doubts do not place me in the camp of the violent extremists whose decadent activities I unquestionably condemn nor do they put me in the position of being disloyal or blind to the security requirements of this State. I think we would all agree that the primary obligation of Government is to safeguard the democratic institutions of the State and the rights afforded to our citizens under these institutions.  Any measure which might seriously curtail these rights should undergo the most rigorous&mdash; what I might term&mdash;cost benefit analysis.  This analysis should take place in an atmosphere which would allow Deputies, who may agree fully with the general concern and purposes of this Bill, to express their concern about the effectiveness and the cost in terms of individual liberty of certain sections of this legislation.  We must be able to voice our concern without fear of appearing to give solace or support to extremists.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the argument put forward by Members of the Government that a democratic State has the right to initiate extraordinary and even at times undemocratic legislation to guard the State against the activities of those who are opposed to its very survival or existence.  I accept this but it is a very difficult and dangerous argument because if a democratic State falls into the habit of passing undemocratic legislation for security reasons, what is to prevent that State from evolving into a State with totalitarian characteristics? Where is the objective criterion for the necessity of national security? And without such an objective criterion, who will be able, in the end, to draw the fine line between the necessity for national security and the police state?  If legislation is pushed through in times of panic and national stress, will the time come when voices of reason will no longer be able to mount credible objections to the continuous extension of the State policing authority without appearing to be enemies of the State?</P>
    <P>It is suggested to me that this may well happen.  I admit that it is a rather <Col N="795" /> extreme projection and I would not maintain that we are living in a police state.  But I am maintaining that it is necessary to examine closely the effect on civil liberties of each Bill which extends the policing authority of this State.  We cannot allow the gradual erosion of our civil liberties under the ambiguous requirements of the security of the democratic institutions of the State.  After all, of what use would be a secure State with no democratic institutions to protect it?  Any measure which will restrict citizens' rights to protection of their person and premises from unwarranted search and seizure as well as protection from unreasonably harsh and prolonged imprisonment and their right to due process of the law must undergo very sharp investigation.  It is incumbent on those proposing such measures to offer an impressive case for both the necessity for and the probable effectiveness of such measures. They must convince us of the fact that the benefits accruing from such legislation will far outweigh the cost in curtailment of individual rights under the law.</P>
    <P>It would be great if we could all know that this measure would be applied only against bombers and murderers; in other words, only against the guilty but no such assurance can be given.  If such assurances were obtainable, there would be no need for the process of the law which was instituted to protect the innocent.  Our obligation in a democratic State is to guarantee the effectiveness of our laws over those guilty of criminal acts while at the same time guarantee to the best of our ability that those innocent of such acts will have the best of opportunities to clear themselves.  We would also make sure that the punishment will fit the crime because if not the credibility of our judicial system is at stake.</P>
    <P>First, I should like to address myself to changes in the substantive law contained in the Bill.  I do not understand the intent of including these changes in a Bill the purpose of which the Minister for Justice has indicated is jurisdictional, the prevention of criminals escaping the legal consequences of their deeds. However, the Malicious Damage <Col N="796" /> Act of 1861, the Larceny Act of 1916, the Explosive Substances Act of 1883 and the Firearms Act of 1964 have all been extended to cover a number of offences which may well have no connection with the terrorist activities of fugitive offenders.</P>
    <P>I am particularly worried about the imposition of a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for robbery and aggravated burglary.  The language of the section related to robbery is so broad in regard to the use of force that a strict reading of the section would fail to establish the difference between the force used to snatch a purse and that used to seriously harm or even kill an intended victim.  I am aware that judicial wisdom will play a role in seeing that the punishment fits the offence but surely the fixing of a maximum penalty of life for these offences will act as a criterion or guideline for determining the severity of any given act of robbery or aggravated burglary.  I am not convinced that the probably dramatic increase in the length of sentences for different crimes of this type will serve the cause of justice.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be seen in the position of coddling the criminal element. I am interested only in making sure that the severity of the punishment fits the severity of the crime. This is an essential element of justice under the rule of law and the wording of sections 5 and 6 relating to robbery and aggravated burglary leaves me with some concern and I should like to have additional debate on these matters so that my concern could be laid at rest.</P>
    <P>The Firearms Act of 1964 has been amended by section 8 of this Bill to put the burden of proof on the accused.  I should like now to quote from the explanatory memorandum:</P>
    <P>The essence of the offence will thus be the suspicious circumstances in which the person in question has the firearm or ammunition.  Where the defence is that the accused's purpose was lawful, the new section casts an evidential burden on the accused of proving this.</P>
    <P>Here we have an accused being guilty until proven innocent.  The presumption of innocence has always been the <Col N="797" /> mainstay of justice and I find it difficult to understand the reversal now of the evidential burden.  Has the burden on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a crime has been committed been removed for some reason of which I am not aware?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this point.  If it has been removed, I shall be very interested in hearing the reason for its removal and I will expect that reason to be of such magnitude as will justify tampering with the presumption of innocence which, to my mind, is the foundation of a just trial in law.</P>
    <P>Under section 19 (5) any member of the Garda Síochána may enter, if need be by force, and search any place where that member has reasonable cause to suspect a criminal to be.  My uncertainty here lies in the expression &ldquo;with reasonable cause&rdquo;.  Would this cause cover everything from hot pursuit to door-to-door searching? Reasonable cause could certainly be maintained in the case of hot pursuit, following identification of a fugitive, but could this clause sustain the breaking down of doors along an entire street if someone were following a hunch?  Without the requirement of a warrant, no man will be safe from intrusion in his own house.  Where similar provisions have been enacted in other countries plain clothes police have raided residences causing residents to resist and suffer injury in the process.  Such an occurrence might not be probable here but, if it is even possible, then the alarm must be sounded.</P>
    <P>There is too, the danger that &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; could be interpreted in a rather broad fashion.  I have always maintained that our police force has an excellent record and I do not mean to imply now that they would be likely to engage in Gestapo-like tactics.  My only purpose is to examine the possible results of this section and sound a note of caution if there is a danger of any loss of democratic rights.  These sections should not form any part of the revision of the ordinary law designed to deal with jurisdictional problems.  The Minister used the euphemism &ldquo;reform&rdquo;. I prefer revision.  These revisions <Col N="798" /> of substantive law are desirable in their own right and especially recommended now.  I feel their inclusion in this Bill may cause some confusion and limit the broad investigation and attention these revisions so obviously deserve.  Indeed, they should have been discussed at another time.</P>
    <P>The present atmosphere is not ideal for the discussion and defence of civil liberties but I believe we cannot forego our responsibility in this area.  I appreciate that my doubts concerning the incompatibility of some sections of this Bill with democratic liberty will place me in the role of devil's advocate.  The current role is one of law and order and it is a harsh rule. The recent bombing attack on Dublin Airport is bound to generate support for stringent measures.  In Britain the mood is moving closer and closer towards hanging as a solution.</P>
    <P>I understand the horror, revulsion and anger resulting from terrorist atrocities but, as a democratic politician, I have to raise the question of the importance of this measure from the point of view of civil liberties.  The Minister, in making his case, said Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution should be read in conjunction with Article 38.  Today, our jurisdiction has been confined to offences committed within the State.  Under this measure we will have jurisdiction over crimes committed in Northern Ireland. Doubts have already been expressed as to the validity of this procedure and the probability is that the matter will have to go for decision to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the purpose of the Bill is to deal with the fugitive criminal.  I am aware of the seriousness of the problem and I have no qualms on the Minister's broad outlines but one of the principal arguments has been the issue of extra-territorial jurisdiction, something recommended by the Law Enforcement Commission established as part of the Sunningdale Agreement.  One aspect of it which, I think, is important is the question of the integration into domestic law of the European Convention of Human Rights.  The implementation of this extra-territorial jurisdiction without the other essential <Col N="799" /> reforms in some areas undermines the legitimacy of the role of law in Northern Ireland.  This argument has an element of validity especially from the point of view of the reputation of the Northern Ireland security forces and the lack of a Bill of Rights.</P>
    <P>This is coupled with doubts as to the feasibility and legitimacy of taking evidence on commission, as is proposed by this Bill.  This Bill will fashion a formal link between our judicial system and that in the North and, under the scheme for taking evidence on commission, we will rely heavily on their legal institutions and procedures whilst, at the same time, being unable to exercise much control to establish their credibility.  Visiting judges from the South will be able to sit in at hearings.  They will be able to suggest questions, and only to suggest, to the presiding judge and he will be the one to decide whether or not a witness may claim privilege with respect to a given piece of evidence. Our judges will be forced to give judicial decisions on the basis of judicial procedures over which they will have no substantial control.  That poses a danger to the rights of an accused person.  The lack of control would not be so important, perhaps, were it not for the general lack of credibility in the judicial system there. I will quote now from the Cobden Trust Report issued in June, 1973:</P>
    <P>Nonetheless the surveys which we have been able to make of the working of the courts under the present emergency conditions in Northern Ireland, with all the imperfections which have been referred to, do suggest that there is a small but cumulative measure of sympathy with Protestants and Loyalists.  This applies particularly to the decision to prosecute and the selection or withdrawal of charges by the police and the prosecuting authorities.  It also applies to some jury verdicts.  The judges themselves appear to have gone some way to correct these prior inequalities through their powers to direct acquittals but there was some evidence of inequality in sentences for firearms offences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> The tentative nature of these findings was remarked upon by the Minister for Justice in the Seanad.  Certainly, the security precautions and the confidentiality of pre-trial proceedings will make the findings of this report tentative and, on its own, would not be sufficient to cast doubt on the credibility of the Northern authorities.</P>
    <P>We also have the Compton Report and the Gardiner Report on Interrogation. We have also the report of Amnesty International.  Even more conclusively, we have the Strasbourg indictments.  I should like to ask the Minister when we shall have a report on these indictments because our Government are taking the security establishment in the North before the European Commission on Human Rights on charges of torture and illtreatment. I wonder why this matter which to my knowledge had been finalised has not been reported upon. This is the time to have a report on it because we should be told what has happened during those many months. Remember, those charges were not brought against one or two lowly privates but rather against a number of those in the higher level of the Northern security establishment.</P>
    <P>It may be difficult to rely on any single report or analysis of partiality or abuse by the Northern authorities, but the accumulated effects of all the reports I have just mentioned, along with the Strasbourg indictments are very difficult to refute.  This Bill seems tacitly to recognise that certain security measures and procedures in the North are not exactly up to par, as was evident from what the Minister said about internment being excluded, where escape from lawful custody in Northern Ireland is an offence, and he excluded internment from this.  Therefore, the Minister is in fact saying that all is not right with Northern Ireland.  I wonder why he asks us then to support that system?</P>
    <P>The principal issue, with the extension of jurisdiction, is the adequacy of the taking of evidence by commission. The question then is whether or not the accused will be able to obtain his rights to a fair trial, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human <Col N="801" /> Rights.  This Bill allows the accused to be placed in the custody of the Northern authorities while the evidence is being taken.  I might say that the Minister has argued well that the right of the accused to be present at the taking of evidence, and also the right to cross-examine &mdash;two of the minimum requirements of a fair trial&mdash;are both protected by the provision that the accused, while in custody, will be immune from any proceedings, including arrest or detention, or questioning in respect of any other matter, civil or criminal, while in the jurisdiction where the evidence is being taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have established a case for the Bill upholding the letter of the law of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights but what he has not done is establish a case for the Bill's conformity to the spirit or real purpose of the Article, which is to ensure that the defendant will in fact have the opportunity to be present, to cross-examine witnesses, and that the State would place no barriers in the way of this opportunity because, realistically speaking, the accused may well refuse to go back into the custody of those from whom he has just escaped.  Given the record of the security forces in the North, he could claim that he would be placing himself in jeopardy. If there is even the possibility of his being placed in jeopardy the accused might be justified in refusing to return to custody in Northern Ireland.  At any rate, there is some question in my mind as to whether or not the provisions of this Bill for the taking of evidence by commission are compatible with Article 6 of the convention assuring the accused a fair trial.</P>
    <P>The point about this Bill being an integral part of the Sunningdale Agreement package is evidence here again because, if there were reforms in the police force, if there was a Bill of Rights for all the citizens of the North, as has been recommended, these objections would not be of any significance.  My concern with these provisions of the Bill has been <Col N="802" /> with their effects on the civil liberties of the accused.  My doubts are related to what might be termed the cost/benefit analysis I mentioned at the beginning of my speech.  I do not know for certain that the chief proponents of this Bill have made their case sufficiently strongly, that the probable effectiveness of this Bill will far outweigh any cost entailed in the curtailment of civil rights.</P>
    <P>Having read the Seanad debates, I noticed that the Adaptation Order of 1973 and the Offences Against the Persons Act of 1861 are the most recent measures which would enable people to be tried here for murders committed outside the State. Yet nobody has been tried under that order to this day.  Surely we must have a stronger degree of success for the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill if we are able to justify the enactment of legislation which poses even the slightest threat to existing civil liberties.</P>
    <P>I would have thought we might have our priorities wrong in introducing this Bill at this time.  Whether we like it or not the situation is that the minority in Northern Ireland do not accept the police force in Northern Ireland.  Those who represent the minority, the SDLP, have made it quite clear that the RUC, in their present form, are not acceptable to them.  I would have thought we would have been urging Britain to ensure that the RUC were reformed so that they would be fully acceptable to the minority in Northern Ireland.  Then, justifiably, we could have introduced this Bill and said, without any fear of contradiction, that we are co-operating with the police force in Northern Ireland; that we are sure that this force could assist any individual who is brought back or who returns to Northern Ireland to obtain evidence.</P>
    <P>We could ensure that such a restructured and reformed force would be there to guarantee the rights of the accused while in Northern Ireland.  We cannot do that at present.  Instead we are saying: bring in repressive legislation. That is not the answer to the problems of the North, to my way <Col N="803" /> of thinking.  Rather there should be a more constructive approach. The Government may be taking political initiatives on the North. If they are, there is no visible evidence of it.  I understand, and can appreciate, that a lot must be done behind closed doors.  But, if we are to give the people in the North some hope, if we are not to have despair rampant throughout the North amongst the minority, there must be some evidence that the Government are taking political initiatives, with Britain, to ensure, that there is a Bill of Rights, that there is absolute civil liberty restored up there and that the police force are reformed so that they will be fully acceptable to the minority there.</P>
    <P>That would be the proper approach to the whole problem of the North. If we could achieve a situation like that in Northern Ireland, the bombers, the madmen, the murderers would become irrelevant on the political scene in Northern Ireland.  There would then be an opportunity to build proper structures and institutions there.  We should be using our influence with Britain, asking them to ensure that Northern Ireland is reformed and put into proper shape so that it is a country acceptable to the majority and minority.  That is not the situation at present; it leaves very much to be desired. What has happened is that the IRA have destroyed all hope of the minority ever having their liberties and freedom restored because the support is not there for them due to the bombings that have taken place there.</P>
    <P>I would think&mdash;and I say this on behalf of many friends in the Labour Party&mdash;the Labour Party have always been to the fore defending the freedom and civil liberties of the people of this country.  We have been denounced for this and have been accused of consorting with men of violence in daring to stand up in defence of civil rights and liberties.</P>
    <P>I began to wonder if this procedure of having a debate here was a charade because one could have handed the speeches made by members of the outgoing <Col N="804" /> Government to the present Ministers because we had a complete reversal of 1972 when Fianna Fáil Ministers accused the present Minister and colleagues in Government of consorting with men of violence, of being terrorists and of encouraging subversives in the State.  We had this very operation in this House three years ago almost to the very day.  We now see the men who were defending civil liberties, defending the basic rights and freedoms of our people, who were talking about fascist legislation being brought before the House, defending a measure which to my way of thinking, will not serve the purpose for which it is intended.</P>
    <P>I could appreciate the Minister wanting to take action against terrorists and to ensure that this State of ours is not a haven for subversives, and I realise that he seriously, genuinely and sincerely wants to take measures which will not infringe on the liberties of the people, but I ask him now if he could not look at this Bill again and say that it is repressive legislation, that the situation at this time warrants it but that it must only be a temporary measure and he will ensure that it is a temporary measure by putting an expiration date in it and let it go for a year, and then if it needs to be extended, come back to the House and debate it again and justify its extension.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister very seriously, that this has happened, that there is a precedent for it, and I might say, in paying tribute to the Government of the twenties, that they brought in a number of Acts at that time, prevention of terrorism Acts, and they were only temporary measures, expiring as in the case of the 1923 Act after one year.  The Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act of 1923 remained in force for one year and the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act of 1926 was repealed in 1928, being due to expire in 1932.</P>
    <P>All these Acts had a time limit and I think that many people in this country who realise that stringent measures must be taken against terrorists would be happier if they knew <Col N="805" /> there was a time limit on this Bill and that it would expire in one year. If there is justification for reintroducing it, by all means come back here and debate it, but I have found that when measures go on the statute book it is very difficult to get them removed, and there is a great danger that in the name of safeguarding the institutions of this State, we might add to the weighty load of repressive legislation at present there.  We can do without repressive legislation.  It is not going to help our democracy and in the circumstances, I would ask the Minister seriously to give consideration to what I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to comment on the speech by Deputy O'Connell, except to say that it is interesting to note that at least one Deputy on the Government side accepts that opposition to the Bill does not align those who oppose it with men of violence.  We on this side abhor and repudiate violence in all its forms, by whomsoever that violence is committed, and no matter what the motives may be.  There should be no need for me to make this point.  Our record, both in Government and in Opposition, is proof positive that what I have said is true and I would not have felt it necessary here to reiterate our stand on law and order, were it not for the fact that efforts were made and continue to be made, particularly after the publication of our statement on our policy on Northern Ireland, to align us with violence and terrorism. The shocking, and to me the sad, part of this campaign was that it was in the main carried out by those who were only too well aware that the Fianna Fáil record on law and order is second to none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reaction immediately after the issue of our statement on Northern Ireland&mdash;and I say this in the most charitable way&mdash;could be attributed perhaps to too quick comment after a superficial reading of the document, but the motivation for the campaign at a later stage was quite clearly for the purpose of achieving short-term political advantage here at home, and the motivation for that particular campaign abroad could be a simple <Col N="806" /> repetition of the type of propaganda used here at home, but I might also add that in many instances, and particularly in certain sections of the British Press, the campaign was motivated by deliberate malice.  Whatever the reasons for the campaign, let me say to those responsible for it that they did and are doing a very serious disservice to the cause of peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We heard much after the publication of that document about the alleged breach in the so-called bipartisan approach to Northern Ireland problems in the Republic and the damage which it was said would ensue.  Let me say again that whatever harm might be caused by differing approaches by the various political parties here to the Northern situation, the damage resulting from such, if indeed any damage would result, and I personally do not believe it would, would be as nothing compared with the damage which would result from a situation where the political parties differed in their attitudes towards violence or were believed to differ in their attitude towards violence.  In my view even to suggest that such a difference obtained when in fact it does not obtain is an act of the highest irresponsibility.  To state that such a difference, that is to say, a difference in regard to attitudes to violence, obtains among political parties here is an absolute untruth and is deliberately mischievous and the repercussions of such statements, if believed in certain quarters, could have most serious consequences.</P>
    <P>The Minister yesterday found it necessary to express his indignation at the statements which were made in the British Press and he pointed out that these statements could have very serious repercussions.  I suggest that he might say to his colleagues that some of the statements made by them in relation to the matters I have referred to can also have very serious repercussions. I am not concerned with the purely party political aspect of this campaign.  I am concerned with the effect that such statements by prominent Members, particularly of the Government, can have on the people who are living in such a shocking situation <Col N="807" /> in the North of Ireland.  Coming as I do from a Border constituency, I am only too well aware of the problem and difficulties they face and the need for care in relation to statements which can have this type of repercussion.</P>
    <P>It was sad to find the Minister for Health, when speaking at the Labour Party conference, following the lead given by the more irresponsible Members of the Cabinet, such as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, whose hatred of Fianna Fáil causes him to use the tragic Irish situation without any concern for its consequences.  It was sad to find the Minister for Health questioning our law and order attitude simply to produce a balancing factor for the faithful at that conference who were shattered by the disclosure of the shocking financial mess we have now got in the country as a result of Government mismanagement.  No responsible politician, particularly one in high office, should allow petty party considerations to draw from him statements which he knows to be untrue and which could cause untold damage in the present circumstances in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Those opposite, particularly some of the Ministers, should try to act in a more responsible manner when dealing with a situation of such delicacy.  They would do well to try to emulate the Leader of this party in following the line taken by him in his very excellent speech on this Bill.  We abhor violence but we are in agreement, as has been stated by the Leader of this party, with the objectives of the Bill but we are opposed to the Bill because it is unworkable, unconstitutional and divisive. The Labour Party and many members of the Fine Gael Party, including some Ministers, violently opposed the law which was passed by us to control violence and those responsible for it.  That Act is still in operation and the strong opposition once evinced by the present Government to it has disappeared.  Whatever their objections to that very necessary piece of legislation, I doubt if they would now agree that because they opposed it they were on the side of violence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> We oppose this Bill because we believe that it will do nothing to contain the violence in the North of Ireland, that it is as the old Irish proverb says, an sop in ionad na scuaibe, and that the disillusionment which its ineffectiveness will produce in the minds of all Irish people will result in a proloagation of the violence rather than in its cessation.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government, the British Government, representatives of the loyalists and the nationalists in Northern Ireland met at Sunningdale.  At this meeting it was decided to set up a power-sharing executive and a Council of Ireland.  This was Fianna Fáil policy while in Government and had been developed by them during their term in office.  A third decision made at Sunningdale related to the setting up of a common law enforcement area. There was much with which this side of the House did not agree in relation to the communiqué issued after Sunningdale but we agreed with the two major decisions which had been our policy.  The third matter I referred to, the common law enforcement area, depended to quite an extent on the first two.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach spoke on the Sunningdale agreement communiqué, he stated that Sunningdale had got to be accepted as a package.  In the event of a Council of Ireland being set up it would naturally follow that an all-Ireland court would evolve to try certain offences committed in any part of Ireland.  This, too, would have been acceptable to us.  The situation we find ourselves in today is entirely different. Two very important developments of Sunningdale, power-sharing and the Council of Ireland, have passed into oblivion and we are now offered the rump of that agreement in such an emasculated form as to be offensive to a large proportion of the people of the country.  I am not referring to the Fianna Fáil Party only but to many supporters of the Coalition, particularly in the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>In ordinary circumstances when a Bill is brought before the House it is debated, amended, passes into the law of the land and is respected by all the people of the country, including those <Col N="809" /> who oppose its passage through the House.  Our opposition to this Bill is basic.  It can never be amended to the extent where we would be satisfied with it.  Therefore, when it is passed into law by the Coalition majority in the House, it will not be good law because the opposition to it here is not the opposition of a tiny minority. It is not the opposition of a sectional group.  It is not the opposition of a fanatical group.  It is the opposition of more than half the population of this country.  Fianna Fáil represent approximately 50 per cent of the Irish electorate and, as I mentioned earlier, there is also opposition from quite a considerable section of the support of Fine Gael and very particularly the support of the Labour Party.  Whatever public representatives on the Coalition side may do in the event of votes in the House, the fact is that the majority of the people of the State are opposed to it and, therefore, it will be very difficult to operate the measure if and when it comes into law.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that I do not say this in any provocative sense.  My record here and my speeches on the subject of the North show me to be entirely against violence, to be very much in favour of the unity of my country because I believe the unity of this country will result in a better living for all Irish people, irrespective of class or creed and it also shows me as recognising that Ireland cannot be united by force. I am simply pointing to the fact that no government can pass laws through the House against the wishes of the majority of the people and hope to have them accepted as we all desire our laws should be accepted and respected.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divisive.  It is dividing the people of the Republic and it is dividing the people in the North of Ireland because it is on record that the SDLP are also opposed to this Bill and certainly never wanted it.  It is further dividing our people North and South. We should ask ourselves how such a Bill can achieve what we are all so anxious to achieve&mdash;peace in the North of Ireland, an end to sectarian <Col N="810" /> murders and an end to death and destruction so rampant in the North of Ireland and spreading to this State and also to Britain.  How can we hope that a Bill, which is divisive, can bring about the very basic, essential changes which are necessary to ensure peace when in essence it is creating further divisions among the people of Ireland rather than creating the unity of purpose which is so essential if we are to make a common approach to the solution of this very great problem?</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to rethink this matter, to withdraw the Bill and seek an agreed solution to reach the objectives we have all got in mind. There are much better ways in which reconciliation can be brought about. I feel that far from reconciling the people of this country this Bill will further divide them.  I am convinced that an all-Ireland court which is our alternative to the proposals and suggestions in this Bill can help to bring about the necessary framework which will ultimately result in peace and eventually in unity.</P>
    <P>The purpose of paragraph 10 of the Sunningdale communiqué was the creation of a common law enforcement area in which an all-Ireland court could have jurisdiction.  All the worthwhile parts of the Sunningdale agreement have now passed into oblivion and we are left in this Bill with an emasculated paragraph 10 of the communiqué dealing with law enforcement. There is no mention in the Bill of an all-Ireland court.  We have instead a cumbersome system of exchanging offenders from one area of the country with the other, without any overall common law enforcement area and, indeed, without any effort made towards some kind of common police force.  This party had in mind an all-Ireland court with a police force responsible to it.</P>
    <P>When one considers the fact that the present police force in the North is totally unacceptable to the minority in the North, one begins to appreciate the problems which face us in any effort to reach a just and workable solution.  Perhaps in this respect some people on this side of the Border, <Col N="811" /> because we have a police force here which is very highly respected by everybody, may tend to think that all police forces, including the Northern Ireland police force, have the same high standards and code of behaviour. Such an acceptance, in fact, appears to be the position in Government circles if we are to judge by this Bill. There is no general support in the North for the police force and while some reforms have been introduced, there is no support at all among the minority for this force.  That was made crystal clear at the SDLP convention recently.  The minority are unable to identify with the police force and for good reason.  Yet we are dealing with a Bill here which, if it becomes law, will grant full acceptance to that force in so far as we in the Republic are concerned.  The law enforcement commission which was established as a result of Sunningdale did not discuss in any detail the setting up of an all-Ireland court although they did recognise that it was, perhaps, one of the best proposals put forward.  This quite clearly happened because they were told that the whole matter was one of extreme urgency and that as it would be necessary to have a referendum here before such a court could be set up and as time was precious, they could not wait.  The result was that only the alternatives to the all-Ireland court were discussed.</P>
    <P>It would be amusing were it not so gravely serious, to look back on the Government's expressed extreme urgency of the time and to remember that that is well over a year ago.  Is it not clear that a referendum could have been carried out in that time? Even now, the urgency which the Government claim to attach to this Bill is shown to be false if we have regard to the very tardy manner in which time was made available for discussion of this Bill.  It was only because of pressure from this side of the House that extra time was made available for it.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Government have designed this Bill is unfortunate in view of the fact that much real work should have been put into the preparation of a worthwhile <Col N="812" /> acceptable Bill had the Government the wish to do so.  I do not pretend to have a great deal of competence to deal with the legal aspects of trials under the Bill but I would be interested to know how it is proposed to bring witnesses down here in the case of a person who committed a crime in the North being apprehended here or, indeed, how evidence of certain types of witnesses can be accepted here.  The reputation of the forces of the Crown in Northern Ireland, in so far as the nationalist population is concerned is at zero level.  How do the Government react to this in circumstances in which, through this Bill, they are putting these forces on the same level as our forces here who have the highest respect of all our people?  I wonder how the Government propose to concern themselves with the general antipathy of the nationalist population in relation to the Crown forces there, whether they are going to simply accept the evidence produced by the RUC or by the British Army as they would accept the evidence of our own Garda and Army.  Can we be certain, in any case, that witnesses from the British Army and the police force in Northern Ireland will be willing to give evidence in our courts, where it would be possible to question this evidence?  I have no doubt they will not come and certain sections of the Bill presuppose that in any case.  In that case the evidence will be taken before a commission in Northern Ireland with our courts simply acting as observers while the evidence is taken before a Northern Ireland judge.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister if the judges from our courts who will ultimately try the case will be able to cross question witnesses.  It does not appear to me that they will be able to do so.  In that case we will have to rely on the evidence taken down in writing.  I am aware of the fact that the accused will have the right to be present at the taking of evidence but we are well aware that the likelihood of this happening in present circumstances is almost non-existent. Witnesses, therefore, who appear without the defendant being present can claim privilege and there will be <Col N="813" /> nobody to challenge this claim.  The course of action then, as laid down in this Bill, cannot result in justice.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious aspects of the matter is that if the prisoner elects to attend the court in the North of Ireland he must do so in the custody of the Northern Ireland police. We have considerable knowledge already of the activities of members of this force and as has already been pointed out not only from this side but from the other side of the House as well, we have a case against the British Government before the European Court on Human Rights for acts of brutal treatment of people detained in custody in the North.  Does the Minister accept that this is a satisfactory procedure, that a man from the North being tried here for an offence committed in the North on the evidence of Northern Ireland police officers or soldiers of the British Army should, if he exercises his right to attend the taking of evidence in the North, have to place himself in the custody of the same police force?  As was mentioned by Deputy O'Connell, we have only to study the various reports, in particular the Compton Report, to get the picture of the procedures used by this police force in the interrogation of suspects.  They are reminiscent of methods used in countries which are under dictators and certainly are not methods which could be tolerated in a democracy.  It was on the basis of those reports that the Irish Government decided to bring the case before the European Court on Human Rights.  It is in the hands of such a force that the present Government would have us place people who are innocent until they are proved guilty.  Therefore, we will have a situation in which an accused person who does not wish to return to the North for the taking of evidence, and who has very good reason for adopting this attitude in view of the treatment which he would suppose would be likely to be meted out to him in custody there, will have no means by which he can confront witnesses. Surely nobody could suggest that in such circumstances the accused can have a fair trial?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy <Col N="814" /> has not read the Bill.  He is entitled first of all, to immunity when he goes North and even if he does not want to go North, he can be represented by a solicitor and counsel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has read the Bill.  I am referring to the fact that irrespective of what the Minister may say about immunity he will have to take into consideration the attitude and fears of the individual concerned and the likelihood of his going to the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that he will decide not to go.  In these circumstances he is being deprived of a fundamental right and with all the goodwill in the world it will not be possible for him to have a fair trial. If we take the case of a man who is taken into custody in the North of Ireland and charged with a particular offence, in the event of his escaping, if this Bill is passed, he will be charged with an offence here. While I know, as I said before, if he returns to the North after being allowed on bail here for the purpose of being present at the taking of evidence, he cannot be tried there for this particular offence.  Does anybody, even the Minister, believe that he would be willing to place himself once again in the hands of a force from which he had escaped originally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered also that there is no positive definition of basic human rights in the North. Therefore, the offence for which the accused was originally tried in Northern Ireland might not be an offence here.  In other words, the wording of an offence on both sides of the Border could be the same but the interpretation here and in the North could be quite different. In such circumstances we will be trying the person concerned for committing the offence of escaping from custody and, if found guilty, sentencing him for that particular offence, while at the same time the original offence for which he was arrested in the North of Ireland might not be <Col N="815" /> an offence here at all.</P>
    <P>The problem we are trying to solve here is a political problem.  In my view it cannot be solved by any attempt to provide solutions which do not place political considerations to the forefront.  We have had over the past sixty years a regular occurrence of violence, first, because the country was partitioned against the wishes of the big majority of the Irish people and, secondly, because the statelet set up by Act of the British Parliament was governed for over fifty years for the benefit of one section of that community and the remainder of the community was relegated to the status of secondclass citizens, so much so that a situation had been reached in the North of Ireland where that state of affairs had come to be accepted as the norm, when the loyalist population believed that they had the God-given right to all the helps towards a civilised living and the nationalists had come to the stage where they almost recognised that they had to accept the crumbs.</P>
    <P>The British Government were very well aware of the situation over all this period of time but they did not want to know about it, nor did the much-vaunted, much-acclaimed British sense of justice and fair play show itself in the least concerned that within what they termed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland there were people who came a poor second when, for example, jobs were being filled and houses were being allocated, to name but a few of the disabilities under which a section of the community suffer.</P>
    <P>I stress this because in recent times we find, to some extent at home but more particularly abroad, statements which appear to claim that the root cause of all the difficulties here lies in the physical violence which has for some years besmirched the fair name of this country.  Physical violence there is and I deplore and condemn it without reservation.  We must, however, keep in mind that the physical violence which has escalated to intolerable <Col N="816" /> proportions has its roots deep in 50 years of violence of another nature, that is, institutional violence the basis of which is political and which permits of political solution.  I make this point so as to stress the fact that only through a fair and agreed political solution can we hope to overcome the problems facing us and that attempting to deal with this matter by concerning ourselves only with relatively peripheral matters which are simply a consequence of the underlying malady will achieve nothing.  Even if this Bill, should it pass into law, were workable, which I am convinced it is not, I doubt very much if it would achieve anything.</P>
    <P>It was because the former Fianna Fáil Government kept clearly in its mind that an equitable political solution was the only hope for the future of the North and, indeed, for the future of the Republic and of Great Britain as well that that Government developed the ideas relating to power sharing and the Council of Ireland. To the uninitiated and to those who do not wish to see, majority rule in the North of Ireland would appear to be reasonable.  The loyalists constantly express their devotion to democratic principles and demand government on a majority vote basis such as that prevailing in Britain but we must continue to emphasise and re-emphasise the fact that the Northern Ireland area is one which was cut off from the remainder of the island by deliberate act of the British Government and with the specific intention of ensuring that that part of Ireland would have a majority which would remain a majority forever.  The majority in the North is a minority in the country as a whole, whether the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs likes it or not. We in this country know that this is so but the spate of propaganda from loyalists and from the media in Britain would have us believe otherwise.</P>
    <P>I would just like to refer further to this particular aspect of it because it is important.  I am not referring to this question of the majority in the North in a narrow sense but from some experiences I had in dealing or helping to deal with the Northern Ireland question <Col N="817" /> in the Council of Europe I found that it might be necessary that I should say a couple of words on it here.  The majority and the minority are a permanent fixture in the North of Ireland as things are.  It is a contrived majority and a contrived minority, deliberately designed for a particular purpose.  There is not in the normal, ordinary sense a democratic majority in the North.  Because of British propaganda the attitudes of people outside Ireland, many of them very favourably disposed towards Ireland, are coloured by the fact that they regard this majority as a normal democratic majority and, therefore, they feel that the <i>status quo</i>, which they feel is there because of a normal majority situation, should be maintained and that every effort should be made to avoid doing anything which will disturb the unionist majority.  This approach is very similar to the approach which existed for far too many years and which ensured that the nationalists in Northern Ireland continued for 50 years to have only second-rate citizenship and nobody wanted to know about it. When we raise matters designed to improve the lot of the minority in the North, we are still being met at international level with the attitude that is concerned at all costs to mollify the unionist majority even though it should be clear that this can often mean a refusal to face up to the fact that the nationalists are in consequence being deprived of a right.</P>
    <P>As things are at the present time, there can be no alternative to power sharing in government in the North. The unnatural, deliberately designed, partitioned area demands such a solution but, of course, the loyalist leaders are aware that former loyalist leaders perished on that particular rock and, in fact, they themselves were responsible for the political destruction of former leaders.  So they are now caught in a situation which allows them little room for manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>What I have said may not appear to be relevant to the Bill.  I suggest it is highly relevant and that we are proceeding along highly dangerous lines by pretending that this Bill, which is dividing the people of the Republic in <Col N="818" /> a fundamental way, which is also dividing the people of the island as a whole, can effect any worthwhile improvement in the horrible situation which is confronting us.  Far from improving the situation, it is, in effect, ignoring the basic problem.  By doing that I feel it can do nothing but harm.</P>
    <P>Had the proposals in the Sunningdale Agreement been implemented, had we got a power-sharing Executive and a Council of Ireland with some authority so far as the police are concerned, and following on that the ending of internment, we would be well on the way towards achieving the end we all desire&mdash;peace. We would then have got an acceptable and workable package with the necessary safeguards for both sides on which progress could continue to be made.  We have not got that package and the Government are pretending that this minute element of the Sunningdale Agreement is a worthwhile effort.  This appears to be the only policy this Government have.  Here I agree with what Deputy O'Connell says that if there is a secret policy, he is not aware of it.  As I said, the only policy this Government appear to have is to introduce this type of Bill.</P>
    <P>We must try to get back on the rails.  If for the moment we find it impossible to proceed with the power-sharing arrangement under the Council of Ireland, at least we can insist on an all-Ireland court which even the Government have accepted as being the best solution, if one is to judge by the statements made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  To say that this cannot be achieved because of the present situation is to accept that failure is inevitable.  We have under this Coalition Government not only in relation to the Northern problem but with regard to every other national issue as well, backtracked at the first sign of opposition and by so doing we have left this nation leaderless and rudderless.</P>
    <P>An all-Ireland court, to my mind, is an achievable objective but it would need a constitutional referendum. As I said earlier, the need to have such a referendum to put <Col N="819" /> to the people and the time it would take to do so was the excuse the Government gave for proceeding with this Bill.  Well over a year has since elapsed and we have not yet passed any legislation on this matter.  I have no doubt that we can afford a little more time to clear the way for an effective instrument.  A referendum would pass quickly.  The people have experience of them.  If we were honest and told all the people of the North who are so anxious for peace that the present Bill will not ensure peace&mdash; and if one were to judge by the Unionist papers from the North, they also believe that&mdash;but we would have a much more effective structure and be much surer of results with an all-Ireland court, then I think we would get support for it.</P>
    <P>The Law Enforcement Commission saw considerable merit in an all-Ireland court proposal and they were concerned too with the time factor. As I said already, the time factor has been shown not to have the great importance which the Government tended to give it some time ago.  The really important factor in my view is to ensure that the legislation is effective and obviously, with such deep-seated opposition in principle to this Bill, it cannot be effective.</P>
    <P>I would like again to refer to situations which could arise here in the event of this Bill being passed.  If a person escaped from custody in the North, was arrested here and charged with the offence of escaping from legal custody, the difficulty facing our courts, bearing in mind the pressures on witnesses, the unreliabilily of the witnesses from the Crown security forces, would be so great as to be insuperable.  We have the case where the British authorities claim that a certain individual had committed a series of offences on specific dates when, on the basis of independent witnesses, including our own security forces, that person was proved to have been in the Republic and under constant surveillance at the time the offences were alleged to have been committed.  If we were to suppose that that individual returned to the North, was arrested there and <Col N="820" /> charged with the offences, that he then escaped from custody and fled to the South and was arrested here on the grounds that he had, under the terms of this Bill, broken the law by escaping from lawful custody, what would the position be?  The court would be aware that he had not committed the original offences with which he was charged but they would not be trying him for these offences; they would be trying him for escaping from lawful custody.  If he was found guilty I assume he would be convicted and sentenced.  Surely we could not regard that procedure as justice.</P>
    <P>Then there is the case mentioned by Deputy O'Leary of the young man who was cruelly shot to death by the British army.  He was the sole support of his parents and was not involved in any unlawful or political activity.  We saw what passed for justice at the trial of the soldier accused of his murder.  Under this Bill, members of the British army, some of them willing to act as the army witnesses acted in this case, will be the same people who will be called here as witnesses in many instances.  At the taking of evidence, members of the Irish court present in Northern Ireland at such cases will have no power to question these witnesses in order to elicit the true facts.</P>
    <P>How can this type of legislation gain the confidence of the people which is so necessary if it is to be effective?  The Bill is divisive and will be impossible to operate.  Its worst feature is that the pretence that it can be effective is there, and that it is getting to the root causes of the problem, when we all know that it is only tinkering with it.  Again I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this Bill and to endeavour to re-establish a joint judicial commission representative of North and South and to reconsider the whole matter of the provision of an all-Ireland court.</P>
    <P>For reasons which I have already mentioned, this aspect of a possible solution did not get the attention it deserved when the problem was being discussed by the Law Enforcement Commission.  It must be remembered that that commission did not reject <Col N="821" /> the idea of an all-Ireland court.  The Government, through the voices of some of their Ministers, regarded the all-Ireland court as the best solution. It was only because of the time factor in each case, a factor which could now be regarded as vital, that further efforts were not made to establish it.</P>
    <P>We are asking that a recommendation which was envisaged in the Sunningdale Agreement be made, that is, an all-Ireland court incorporating in some way the police authorities from both North and South.  This court would have a positive function.  Not only would it be concerned with ensuring that those who broke the law were brought to justice, but it could be given the task of ensuring that basic civil rights are assured.  There must be basic acceptance of the law and those who operate it, otherwise there would be no respect for it and it would be impossible to administer. What we appear to be doing here is taking certain action without first ensuring that human rights are safeguarded. In an all-Ireland court where there would be a certain element of control of the police we would have an institution which would have the respect of all.  We would be laying the foundation stone for peace.  If we do not concern ourselves with the positive human rights approach, and instead confine ourselves to the rather negative approach of bringing the offender to justice, then we are unlikely to make progress along the road to peace and we will continue to face the shocking situation that we have. Dealing piecemeal with problems of this sort has had little success to date. Rushing legislation of this type through the Dáil will not solve anything. Patience and care and positive thinking are necessary.  The process will be slow but in the end it will pay a worth-while dividend in bringing peace to our nation.  Giving the country the tail-end of the now defunct Sunningdale package is worse than useless and no solution at all.</P>
    <P>I sincerely ask the Minister to reconsider the situation and to set up a commission, give them the terms of reference relating to an all-Ireland court and give them time to find a <Col N="822" /> reasonable solution.  Only in that way can the people of Ireland have hope for the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill is unconstitutional.  The case for this belief has been made by the Leader of this party and other speakers. The Minister himself, despite his protestations that the Bill is constitutional, has now stated that if he were satisfied with the arguments put forward by speakers in this House he would be willing to refer a case to the courts.  As pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition, it is the duty of the Government to produce legislation which is constitutional and it is positively not for any Government to have legislation passed about which there are doubts as to its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divisive.  Not only does it divide the Government and the Opposition but it also divides supporters of the Government here and throughout the country.  The whip which was cracked by the Tánaiste at the Labour Party Conference when he said that defeat for the Bill would mean a general election will probably have the effect of ensuring that Government Deputies will support the Bill and ensure its passage but the fact remains that forced prayers are no devotion. Government Deputies who have shown by their actions and frequent statements that they are opposed to the Bill will, while walking in one direction, undoubtedly continue to hold their views and the followers of the Coalition who feel as these Deputies do and who do not suffer from the same constraints will continue to voice their views publicly and we will have a situation here where expediency will prevail to the detriment of our democratic system.</P>
    <P>Opposition to this Bill is much more widespread than the number of Deputies on this side of the House represent. We all have the same objective; we all want peace.  We want to lay the foundations of what will result in bringing to a close a frightening chapter in our history.  We can only succeed by facing the problem as a whole, by adumbrating and following the policy we believe will bring about the conditions which will result in peace. Attacking the problem piecemeal as has happened too often in the past, will <Col N="823" /> fail to achieve our aim.  It is time that we legislators tackled the problem in a realistic way.  Failing to do so can result ultimately in our condemnation in the eyes of posterity.</P>
    <P>The nationalists in the North will not go to the RUC for protection because in the past they know there has been collusion between some members of the RUC and the loyalists.  They will not go to the British army for protection because they see for themselves that the army regard the loyalists as &ldquo;us&rdquo; and the nationalists as &ldquo;them&rdquo;. The vast majority of the nationalists do not want the men of violence nor do they desire to be associated with them in any way but they do need help and protection and support and they expect all these things from us.</P>
    <P>What is this Government doing by way of policy to uphold the morale of these people and strengthen them in their time of need?  The simple answer is nothing.  The people in the North of Ireland who expect some sympathy from us in their travail are caught between the hostility of the forces of the Crown and the bomb and the bullet of the extremists of all shades.  They are being offered nothing by this Government except a negative Bill.  This will not do.  What is really needed is a framework which will ensure civil liberties for all the people of the North, which will ensure that each citizen, whether Protestant or Catholic, rich or poor, will have full and equal rights with his fellow citizen.  The softly-softly policy of the Government in regard to the North is just an excuse for doing nothing: it is not a policy.  One has only to talk to the ordinary nationalist in the street in Northern Ireland to know that he has absolutely no faith in the policy of the present Government&mdash;if you may call it a policy. All it does is make available this Bill which, as we have said on many occasions in this debate, is unconstitutional and divisive and unworkable.</P>
    <P>I make a final appeal to the Minister to withdraw the Bill and reconsider the whole situation so as to try to introduce substance for the shadow he is presenting here.  On the matter of such fundamental importance, <Col N="824" /> when people's lives are at stake, he can be assured of the seriousness of our approach and if he takes cognisance of this I think he will feel the need to make a more positive and more fundamental approach to this very great problem.</P>
    <P>Finally, let us remember that the Sunningdale Agreement was presented to this House as a package which the Taoiseach then said had to be accepted in its entirety and which Government spokesmen claimed at that time could only be effective if accepted in its entirety. The same people are now proposing that the Irish people should accept an infinitesimal part of this agreement or rather a substitute for the original agreement.  This will not do. We have a duty and responsibility as legislators to produce an effective Bill which will be a milestone along the road to peace.  We are not doing that here.  I believe that if the proposal put forward by us as an alternative were to be adopted by the Government we would be doing something worth while.  I should like to know from the Minister who is objecting to an all-Ireland court.  It is not the Government, if one is to judge by the statements made by some of the Ministers; it is certainly not Fianna Fáil.  Is it the British Government?</P>
    <P>The British Government have the power to help set up such a court and to co-operate with the Irish Government in doing so.  I am convinced that if we were to set about this matter in a proper, constructive manner we could produce something acceptable not only to Deputies but to our people in general.  It would help us to achieve what is so badly needed in this country, and that is peace.</P>

      <P>Last night I was challenged by two Ministers to state what they should do now that they find themselves in a position of their own making because of their lack of effort in the past in order to avoid increasing postal charges now.  The Minister for Finance threatened, as did his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that the alternative was to lay off workers or reduce the services, services which are already chaotic.  I assert that neither of these is necessary.  Had the Minister made the necessary provision in the last two-and-a-half years the Department could now be working excellently without any increases in postal charges.</P>
      <P>We were told that these increases were due to increased pay.  I saw a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning signed by the secretary of a trade union which accused the Minister of wrongfully putting them in the position of being the cause for the increases and pointing out that these increases will be of no benefit to them.  That letter was signed by a secretary of a trade union in the Post Office service.</P>

      <P>This desperate device of increasing charges will not improve the position.  The Minister is in breach of his own undertaking to do something to unwind the inflationary spiral and his own action now in complete contradiction of what he has been preaching in recent times in regard to the necessity to call a halt to increases which will in any way aggravate the situation, is eroding the competitiveness of people engaged in production.  It is also in breach of the statement by the NESC who say there must be no further loads added to what industry is already carrying.  The latest newsletter from the Confederation of Irish Industry makes it quite clear they have gone as far as they can in the load that has been put on industry, a load which has resulted in the laying off of workers, in liquidations, in eroding competitiveness and putting industries in the position in which they are unable to continue exporting.  This is a negation of what is regarded as essential in aiming at some form of recovery or holding the serious situation in which the onward march is towards 130,000 unemployed.  It is difficult to understand the Government deliberately taking part in this kind of action at a time when they are calling on everyone else to do just the opposite. The Minister asked what we would do.  If we were in power, the situation would not occur.  The Minister accused Fianna Fáil of not borrowing sufficient in their time.  If I remember correctly, the Minister last year announced a huge loan for the development of the telephone service. I think it was £60 million.  This year a further £7 million is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy talking about telephone capital development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Money for developing the telephone service.  If I remember correctly, the accounting in the Department is in three sections: the telegraphic service loses heavily; <Col N="827" /> the postal service about pays its way and the telephone service makes a profit.  It is the best money spinner of the Department.  It carries the other services on its back.  Huge amounts have been borrowed and there is no sign of any rapid development.  Surely the Minister should be in a position now to carry out the proper development of this service.  He has the nucleus of a trained staff in installers and technicians and the remainder of the staff required are unskilled workers.  He has 107,000 people from whom to select in order to develop the telephone service to the point where profitability can be increased tenfold.  There would be many more applicants for the service if the price were kept at a reasonable figure and people could be assured of a satisfactory service.  If the Minister uses the money available to him to develop the most profitable wing of his Department, surely he need not be afraid to allow the Department to run at a deficit for a year.  The Department is supposed to pay its way one year with another.  There were years in which it did not do that.  There were years in which it showed a deficit.  But there were also years in which it showed a substantial credit.  The Minister is in a position now because of the huge borrowing to develop rapidly one of the most profitable services in the whole economy.  He can do that because he has the staff available and he can use unemployed and the school leavers seeking jobs.  There should be no delay.  He has the money and the personnel.  The present employment in the Post Office could be doubled thereby taking people off the dole queue and increasing the potential income of the Department.  He would then be in a position in which he need not add one penny to any of the services.  That is the simple answer to the question he asked as to what we would do if we were handling the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not living in normal times. The country is undergoing the most serious recession it has experienced for a long time.  We have discovered that most of the trouble stems from within our own economy because lack of <Col N="828" /> action by the Government in relation to the inflationary spiral has brought about all of this.  Belatedly, we discovered that domestic inflation is the cause which, according to the Minister for Finance, if kept in check and with the proper constraints applied, could be reduced by half.  That is the Minister for Finance's own statement. I suggest that the Government are the first people who should show this example.  By this action they have once again set in motion another rise in the inflationary spiral which could be the beginning of a very serious situation indeed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to take this motion as the Minister for Finance described it, as a piece of political manoeuvring but rather take it seriously and adopt the advice his Government have been giving to the people, industrialists and others in this country, seeking to keep exports going. By so doing, he could make a substantial contribution to the effort the Government have asked people to undertake.  He could give great example by saying these increases will not now take place; that the potential for profitability in the Department can be doubled, trebled, by using the borrowed money available to them to carry out a huge scheme of development thereby obviating the need for any increase in the service.</P>
    <P>I expect that the Minister, in his wisdom, will announce that he is not now taking the action he proposed and of which our people, industry and workers, will be the victims in the final analysis.</P>

    <P>I hope we will have clarification from Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, the spokesman for Fianna Fáil in this area, when he comes to close this debate because, as I understood him in his opening remarks here, he agreed <Col N="829" /> that a deficit of this magnitude could not be tolerated.

      <P>There is one fundamental fact that many people who have spoken on this subject have failed to face.  That fact is the nature of the real alternative to increasing Post Office charges.  The real alternatives to that are just two.  One must either reduce the services and dismiss postal workers or heavily subsidise the postal services and pass the cost on to the general taxpayers.  Deputy Brennan appears to produce another alternative&mdash;one borrows the money to bridge that large deficit on these services which should pay for themselves during the year to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first alternative has been urged in some business circles, though not in all.  It is true that a reduction in postal services, especially in rural areas, could be made to yield savings but the consequences have to be clearly faced.  If a reduction in services is to produce savings in the here and now, it must be accompanied by a laying-off of staff on a massive scale, especially in rural areas.  This would mean a serious worsening of standards for everybody, not just for those in the rural areas.  Pay constitutes 80 per <Col N="830" /> cent of the cost of the postal services. There is no way of reducing these costs except by large-scale dismissals and/or pay reductions.  People who talk about large-scale reductions to be achieved immediately by unspecified productivity measures should consider a little seriously the actual nature of the postman's work and the intractable amount of leg work it usually entails.</P>
    <P>The other alternative means deliberately passing on to the taxpayer a large part of the cost of services of which he or she may, in fact, make very little use.  In its extreme form it would make taxpayers who have no telephone and who seldom use them pay a disproportionate share of the cost of running an expensive service from which others benefit substantially.  The Government oppose these alternatives and adhere to the principle always upheld heretofore by which the cost of Post Office services should be paid for by the users of those services. That general principle&mdash;there are time lags occasionally&mdash;has been upheld by all successive Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs.  I do not think any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has made the kind of proposal we have heard this evening from Deputy Brennan now in opposition.</P>
    <P>We still have to look forward to clarification from the Opposition&mdash; which we shall have, I hope, from Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick when he winds up the debate&mdash;as to what they are really at, whether they are proposing that this become a recognised deficit of £24.6 million for the coming year or whether they mean that, when they speak of a deficit in the Post Office this should be bridged by a subsidy from the Government or by general borrowing to finance a service which it has always been admitted in the past ought to pay for itself. Unless the Opposition can resolve the dichotomy opened up by the quite different approaches of Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Brennan, a heavy charge of simple opportunism rests upon it here.</P>

      <P>I expressed the hope already that time for these interruptions will come out of the side opposite because I have a limited time.</P>
      <P>As is noted in our amendment to Deputy Fitzpatrick's motion, the principle has been accepted by successive Governments, without exception, that Post Office services should pay their way and should not place a burden on the taxpayer.  This principle has not been absolutely strictly followed every year, as a glance at the accounts for post office services will show.  But it has been recognised that, in the long run, taking one year with another, the principle should be maintained.  In the period from 1922-1923 to 1965-1966 deficits were incurred in 22 years while surpluses were made in the other 22.  During that period also, with the exception of the first year&mdash;which was entirely exceptional&mdash;none of the deficits exceeded £1 million.  Since 1966-67 deficits have been incurred each year, apart from 1969-70, but the first deficit in excess of £1 million was incurred in 1970-71.  It is in the last few years only that such deficits have occurred to a substantial extent.  This has happened because the extra revenue from increases in charges introduced in 1970, and on two occasions since then, has not been sufficient to cover the extra cost arising from the exceptionally high rate of inflation in recent years.  This gives rise to a time lag on which, in the Government's belief, we have to catch up.  As a result, the following overall deficits were incurred: 1970-71, £1.707 million; 1971-72, £1.422 million; 1972-73, £3.556 million and 1973-74 £6.548 million. The overall deficit for the nine months ended 31st December, 1974 was about £7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> I am indicating the reasons why in applying the principle, taking one year with another, the charges have to go up now, unless the principle is to be abandoned that postal services should support themselves.  The deficit for the current year is estimated at £13.8 million and this would rise to £24.6 million in 1976, if corrective measures were not taken now.  The forecast deficit of £24.6 million for 1976 is made up of £8.1 million on postal services, £3.0 million on the telegraph service and £13.5 million on the telephone service.  The idea that the telephone service is automatically highly remunerative even if you keep the charges down, with which Deputy Brennan toyed is of course unfounded and it is also true that large amounts of money have to be borrowed under the telegraph development programme and high interest rates have now to be paid on those loans.  If money had been borrowed on an adequate scale, if investment on an adequate scale had been undertaken earlier when interest rates were lower, we would not have to do these things now.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Fitzpatrick that the 1976 figures allow only for the basic increases in pay applicable under the 16th round national pay agreement.  No provision is made for any increases which may accrue after the termination of the current agreement or for any special increases additional to the basic increases provided for under the 16th round.  I should like to make that quite clear.  The same sort of position applied at the time of the last increases when it was made clear that the charges then announced would not fully offset the prospective deficits on the services. Subsequent increases in pay and other costs are responsible for the deficit now expected in 1975.  It will, I think, be abundantly clear from these figures that the Post Office was facing a serious financial position and that urgent measures were called for.  To postpone taking remedial action would have meant charging rates which were hopelessly uneconomic, thus distorting demand for the Department's services and would have made it that much more difficult to put these services on a proper financial footing in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> Why are we facing the serious financial position I have described? The answer is quite simple: the Post Office is no more immune from the effects of inflation on its costs than any other business is.  Some newspapers have described the recently announced increases as huge, massive, cavalier, monstrous and so on.  The increases which are designed to yield extra revenue sufficient to cover the estimated deficit of £24.6 million in 1976 will average 30 per cent for postal and 35 per cent for telecommunications services.  Admittedly, some charges will go up by 40 per cent, as mentioned in the Fianna Fáil motion.  It is worth remembering, however, that a Fianna Fáil Government increased the basic inland letter rate by 50 per cent, from 6p to 9p, from 1st October, 1970.  People who criticise the size of Post Office increases usually overlook the fact that there is normally an interval of a year or more between revisions of these charges.  For example, 15 months will have elapsed from the date of the last increase in postal charges until the new charges are introduced.  The average increases of 30 per cent for such charges therefore represents an increase of 24 per cent for 12 months which is not seriously out of line with cost rises since the present postal charges were introduced. Pay rates have increased by over 30 per cent in the past 12 months and as staff costs account for about 80 per cent of postal expenditure an increase in such charges of more than 30 per cent might reasonably be expected 15 months after the last increases under these conditions.</P>
    <P>In the past, Irish postal charges have been compared unfavourably with British rates.  In recent years, British rates were fixed at an uneconomic level by deliberate choice.  For example, when our present basic inland letter rate of 7p was fixed the corresponding British rate was only 4½p.  However, in accordance with the decision of the British Government that there should be a phased return to economic prices by the nationalised industries in Britain, a decision quite contrary to the policy urged by <Col N="834" /> Deputy Brennan, British post office charges have been raised twice this year by very substantial amounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Still lower than ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In some respects they are and in some respects they are not.  The basic letter rate in Britain is now 8½p, an increase of almost 90 per cent in a period of 12 months and only a half penny less than the rate which will apply here from 1st January next.  Other Irish postal charges from 1st January will be generally lower, some significantly so, than the British rates.  Our new telegram and telex charges will be considerably below current British charges.  The telephone charge structures in the two countries differ but generally the new charges here are below the British level.  I do not wish to labour the comparison with British charges because conditions in the two countries are not the same.  I feel, however, that the particulars which I have given will help Deputies to judge whether our new rates have been fixed at an unreasonably high level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been asked why the deficits being experienced cannot be offset by improved efficiency and productivity. The Department are fully conscious of the need for extra productivity and of ensuring that the services they provide are operated with the maximum economy.  There is a constant effort to improve performance by way of organisation and methods and the extension of data processing, in both of which fields the Department were pioneers in this country, and most recently by setting up a Post Office Users' Council and by accepting the survey of the National Prices Commission, the Department are introducing methods of inquiry into their work which are unusual in relation to the public service generally.  On the postal side, mail distribution and delivery arrangements are constantly being revised with a view to economy.  Rural delivery services are being motorised as quickly as staff vacancies permit and uneconomic marginal services are continuously being looked at critically. In telecommunications, advantage is taken of technological developments and improved working methods.  Costs <Col N="835" /> swings from year to year resulting from these efforts are substantial, but in comparison with pay increases and other cost increases arising from inflation, are very small indeed.</P>
    <P>This experience is not peculiar to this Department or to this country. I have already referred to the position in Britain.  All posts and telecommunications administrations in Europe have faced for some years, and are at present facing, serious financial difficulties arising from the effects of rising costs.  Inflation on the scale of recent years simply cannot be offset to any significant extent by higher productivity.  Through our membership of international organisations such as the Universal Postal Union and the International Telecommunications Union, the Department have access to the results of continuing expert studies into many aspects of postal and telecommunications services and these are available for our use.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat: the prospective financial situation facing the Department in 1976 could be dealt with only in one or more of three ways&mdash;by a reduction in the range and/or the quality of existing services, by subsidisation or by charging economic tariffs.  I have referred to these matters briefly already and I propose to discuss now the question of restricting services.  I assume that it is generally accepted that there should be no question of holding back unnecessarily on telephone and telex development or of deliberately worsening the standard of these services.  So far as I am concerned, the emphasis here must be very much one of significantly improving present standards rather than the reverse.  The Department are not providing telephones nearly as quickly as I or the Government would like or as the public are demanding.  The standard of telephone service to existing subscribers is deficient in a number of respects as it has been for many years, and the pressure from users is for the remedying of deficiency.</P>
    <P>The telephone and telex services form an important part of the national economic infrastructure, particularly <Col N="836" /> from the point of view of industrial development and the promotion of trade with other countries.  I am satisfied that the question of restricting these services does not merit serious consideration, nor is it being urged on us here.  There may be more in the case for restricting postal services, but again that case has not been made here and I do not propose therefore to linger on it as I am restricted in time.</P>
    <P>I am certainly not aware of any demand from users for severe restrictions in the standard of the postal services.  None of what I have said should be taken to mean that individual postal services should not be critically reviewed on a continuing basis, in the light of the financial position and of changing consumer attitudes. That will continue to be done but so far as the prospective deficits facing us in 1976 are concerned there are no conceivable reductions in standards, even if they were to be implemented with complete disregard for the staff affected and for the attendant social consequences which would have obviated the need for the increase in charges which have been decided on.</P>
    <P>The telegram service has run at a deficit since it began and for social reasons that continues.  The other policy alternative to charging economic prices in a situation of financial deficit is subsidisation.  I do not know if I understood Deputy Brennan rightly in suggesting that and, as I say, I do not understand the position over there in this area.  If charges are not to be raised to an economic level, the resulting deficit in the accounts must be borne by the taxpayers.  It seems more equitable that the cost of the services should be met by the users rather than the taxpayers because the public use the services in widely differing degrees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick waxed indignant about the fact that the Department, unlike private industry, are not required to submit proposed increases in charges to the National Prices Commission.  This indignation would be better founded if it were not for the fact that it was the Fianna Fáil Administration which incorporated <Col N="837" /> in the Prices Act, 1958, the exclusion from price control legislation of charges in respect of activities carried on by or on behalf of a Minister for State.  In October, 1971, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy P.J. Lalor, established by order the National Prices Commission whose powers did not extend to examination of charges for such services as the Post Office carried on by a Minister of State. The Press release concerning the establishment of the National Prices Commission stated that under administrative arrangements increases in prices or charges for trading services provided by the State, as well as some others, were already &ldquo;subject to the closest scrutiny and require Government and Ministerial sanction before they are implemented&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Prices (Amendment) Act, 1972, brought certain charges previously excluded for activities of semi-State bodies, except shipping and air transport, under the price control legislation but the continued exclusion of Post Office charges, as well as charges for some other services, from control legislation was a fully deliberate decision.  Speaking in the Dáil on 11th July, 1972, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy P.J. Lalor, said that he considered it would be inappropriate that the activities of the various Departments of State, local organisations, vocational education committees and harbour authorities should come within the scope of the Prices Act as that would lead to unacceptable confusion as to the functions and responsibilities of various Ministers.  He confirmed this view on 18th July, 1972, in the course of a Seanad debate on the Bill when the question of control of postal charges was raised there.</P>
    <P>A case can certainly be made for the exclusion of charges made for services provided by the State from legislative control in the knowledge that proposals for increases in such charges will be dealt with responsibly by the Government, and a case can be made for bringing these charges under review by the National Prices Commission, but you cannot have it <Col N="838" /> both ways.  It is a bit much to have Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick complaining bitterly of the exclusion of such charges, which were so excluded deliberately and after full consideration, from legislative control by the Fianna Fáil Administration such a very short time ago.</P>

      <P>As I said before, I hope there will be some allowance for the frequent and unchecked interruptions in relation to the limited time in which I have to contribute to this debate.  Notwithstanding the statutory position and the fact that the proceeds from charges for Post Office services form an integral part of the flow of funds into the Exchequer, the Government decided that the National Prices Commission should be given an opportunity of expressing their views on the proposal for increases contrary to the position adopted by Fianna Fáil, though you might think differently when you read this motion and amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was made clear, the commission intimated that the urgency of the proposals and the very limited time available precluded a detailed examination by them of the proposals. They recommended that the commission should have a consultancy study carried out in relation to the operations of the Post Office in order to provide background information for the examination of future proposals for increases in these charges. I intend to ask the commission to undertake such a study.  The chairman of the Post Office Users Council <Col N="839" /> has informed me that in his belief the council will be prepared to co-operate with the National Prices Commission in having this review carried out.</P>
    <P>I am not able at the moment to complete in as much detail as I would like my review of this matter because I am pressed by time, but there are one or two points which should be made.  The duty of the Department, which they are doing their best to fulfil, is to put themselves in a position as soon as possible to cater not merely for present unmet demand but also for future needs.  for historical reasons, the service is at present relatively underdeveloped and there is no doubt in anybody's mind that it needs to extend at a faster rate than ever before to meet the demands of commerce, industry and agriculture over the coming years.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 27th November the chairman of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, who has been critical of some aspects of these increases but who, in relation to telephones says this, which I consider is basic. Mr. Bambrick said:</P>
    <P>The extra cost for telephones seems unavoidable if the necessary capital equipment is to be provided so that our creaking system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I agree with him.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;can be brought up to modern standards.  The financial load would now be less if adequate expenditure on modernisation had been made over the past decades.</P>
    <P>That is so.  In brief, it would be retrograde and in the long run financially unwise to cut back on telephone development.  I would say this also.  If in raising capital for telephone development one of the most important things to show is that the Government are determined that the telephone service and the postal services shall be made to pay their way.  The proposal just now made by Deputy Brennan, &ldquo;Oh, do not mind about a deficit of £24.6 million next year, just carry it&rdquo;, would mean that it would be harder to <Col N="840" /> borrow money, harder to develop the telephone services and harder to provide this basic structure.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to quote two paragraphs from a letter I have just received from Aleck C. Crichton, the chairman of the Post Office Users Council announcing to me the coming of the Post Office Users Council's report which I hope to receive before the end of the year.  He makes two points which I would like to put on record, and I do so by agreement with him.  One point is this:</P>
    <P>The public must be told and must appreciate that the development of a national telephone system is analogous to forestry in its long-term nature.  One cannot get in and out of the business of telecommunications as a farmer can do in the business of say turkey-rearing or pigbreeding. Our present position results from lack of determination years ago to develop a telephone system comparable let us say to the ESB which gives its service virtually to every hamlet.</P>
    <P>At another point he says:</P>
    <P>It is probably impossible for the public to value now the telecommunications service which they should get in ten years time, because it is a feat of imagination. But I think the Council expects you and the Department to persuade the Government and the public that a telecommunications service comparable to that of our neighbours is a pre-requisite to maintaining a reasonable standard of living; and that expenditure on telecommunications is an insurance against the effects of rapidly rising costs in the postal sector, by providing an alternative means of communication.</P>
    <P>He adds then that he hopes the council may be able to play some part with the prices commission in furthering the interests of the public.  We recognise that this increase in charges bears heavily on sections of business and on the public though the extent of that should not be exaggerated.  We are talking, after all, of an increase in the CPI of 0.24 per cent which we may regret but at least the figure should put into perspective some of the <Col N="841" /> strongest language that has been used. The fact is that this increase in charges is necessary, unfortunately, in conditions of inflation, in particular wage inflation, for the sound development of the postal service and particularly the further development of the telephone service, part of the infrastructure of our whole future economic development.</P>

      <P>I am very worried about the closing of sub-post offices in rural Ireland, doing away with the <Col N="842" /> postal services, the delivery of letters, the very bad telephone service we have.  There has been a reduction in the bus services for children going to primary, secondary and vocational schools.  There are no amenity grants this year.  The Minister said that we on this side had no solution to the problem with which he is faced of a deficit of £24 million.  We have a solution to it.  Our spokesman, Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Dublin Central)</i>, is a businessman.  Because he is now a politician he has had to hand over his business to a manager and staff.  He knows how to run a business.  He would not run a business by subsidising it all the time and by increasing prices.  There are people waiting for telephones in this city, in every town and every part of rural Ireland.  Why does the Minister not supply them? In that way he would get in more revenue.  Why does he not borrow money for capital?  I am not suggesting that he should borrow money for the current account.  Already the Government have borrowed £650 million and are running into a deficit of about £300 million this year but that is being paid out in social welfare benefits and so on and there is no income back from it.  The Government can go to the European Bank again and borrow money to give the people the services they require and the people will pay their rental charges.  I was a businessman before I became a politician.  This is the one Department that could be run as a business.  Here is an area in which people are asking for a service and cannot get it.  Why not borrow money to give the people their telephones and then there will be a revenue from that?</P>
      <P>The Minister glibly asked us to compare our postal and telephone charges with those in Britain.  He admitted that they are higher here. I think it is 8½p in Britain at present and it will be 9p here in January. I will probably table a question on this subject in January.  The Minister also said that we in 1970 increased the price of the stamp by one penny. Nobody worries about one old penny.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, before the Labour Party conference, made a statement to the effect that we must not increase prices, we must not ask for more wages and so on.  Of course, the Taoiseach was undermining the Labour conference at that time.  It is a good political ploy by the leader of one political party to undermine the conference being organised by the other party and on the newspapers, radio and television the next day he got more coverage than the Labour Party conference.  At the same time, the Tánaiste, the Leader of the Labour Party, also called for restraint. Then we have the one business in government increasing postal charges by 30 per cent and telephone charges by 35 per cent.  How can the Taoiseach ask for restraint while at the same time the Government go mad with a 30 and a 35 per cent increase?  The Minister said this should not affect the cost of living. I know, as a businessman, that a medium sized firm sends out, say, 100 invoices.  A week or two later they send out 100 statements and may be after that they send out reminders. They may have to use the telephone frequently.  The cost of the business is increased by 30 per cent in respect of postage and 35 per cent in respect of telephone charges.  How can the Minister suggest that this will not affect the cost of living?  These costs will affect the baker, the supplier of tea, butter or sugar.  Profits are so small that the increased postal and telephone charges will have to be reflected in the cost of the goods they sell.  The Minister may say what he likes but these increased charges will have to be paid for by the public. He might as well put one penny on VAT or 2p on the packet of cigarettes or on the pint or a penny on a half glass of whiskey.  It is the public who will pay the increased charges.  A man said to me that he was not very worried about the increased charges as he writes only one letter a month.  He does not realise that these increased charges will be reflected in the cost of his bread and butter and so on.</P>

    <P>I come to a very important point as far as persons in public life are concerned.  It is a matter that Members <Col N="844" /> of the Oireachtas should consider. I am thinking of county councillors, urban councillors, town commissioners, members of corporations who are voluntary public servants elected by the people.  People may not realise that these people have to pay for their postage and telephone calls, that they do not get one penny in respect of these expenses although some people think that they do.  Before I was elected to Dáil Éireann I was a member of a county council and a member of a town commission. Members of county councils know the problems they have had in the past and will have in the future when asked by a constituent to help in some particular problem.  This involves using a telephone or writing letters. It may cost the councillor about 25p for one little bit of voluntary work, for which he gets very little thanks.  I do not think Members of the Oireachtas have the facilities that they should have but at least they can send 30-40 letters a week in official envelopes and possibly make local telephone calls.  I do not think the public realise that when I make a long-distance call to a constituent in Carlow or to the county council I have to make it from a coin box in this House and have to insert the necessary number of shillings.  In this House, in 1975, Deputies have to do this.</P>
    <P>The people I am talking about are members of county councils.  Nobody knows better than the Acting Chairman, Deputy Pattison, and myself how difficult it would be for these people to continue to give the excellent service they give to the people in their electoral areas and outside them in face of these massive increases in postal and telephone charges.  The day will come when they will say that they should be entitled to free postage and telephone service.  These people should get some recognition now because of the great cost involved.</P>

      <P>I do not query your decision.  I accept it.  I thought the situation was that if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said that he would give free postage to county councillors the Minister for Local Government would not object.  It may be that the Ceann Comhairle would decide differently.  There is one point to which the Minister did not refer. May I ask why the Minister did not borrow money in order to provide telephones for all the people who have applied for them at a time when there are 107,000 unemployed?</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will borrow more money in order to provide this service.  I do not want him to borrow money in order to give free postage or anything like that.  I want him to borrow it for capital purposes, in other words for the erection of telephone poles and everything else that is necessary in order to provide people with telephones.  In this way employment would be created and the number on the unemployed register would be reduced and, in addition, a service would be provided for which people will pay.  In my constituency there are hundreds of people who have applied for telephones and who will give the Minister not only this year's rent but five or six years' rent.  That would be the ideal solution to the problem the Minister has.  If the Minister did that there would be no necessity to come back to the House at the end of 1976 and glibly state that he requires a 30 per cent increase in postal charges and a 35 per cent increase in telephone charges.  On 1st January the increased charges will apply.  I hope that during 1976 the Minister will think of borrowing and borrowing.  I do not want the Minister to quote me somewhere as saying that we should borrow more money.  I want the Government to borrow money for capital investment as we <Col N="846" /> did in the past, and get a return from it. The money should be invested in housing, in providing a telephone service, and so on.  I do not want the Government to borrow money in order to pay Deputies or civil servants or anything like that because that is current account expenditure.  Where would we get that money next year?  I want to be on the record as saying that the Government should borrow for capital expenditure by this Department.  That would solve all the Minister's problems at the end of next year.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This motion was not put down for political advantage.  The terms of the motion have already been read out in this House.  We said we deplored the increase and asked the Minister to submit his proposed increases to the National Prices Commission. That was the reason I put down this motion when the Minister announced the decision a week ago.</P>
      <P>Last night I listened to the Minister for the Public Service and this evening I listened with interest to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs justifying the increases.  I was rather disappointed that the Minister for the Public Service could offer no hope for curbing public expenditure which is part and parcel of the increases the Minister mentioned for his Department.  The only solution the Minister for the Public Service could offer was that there would have to be massive redundancies within the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I reject that policy in Government circles as I would reject it in the private sector, because that is the last resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In today's inflationary age, people's livelihood is of vital importance.  We should be able to guarantee them a decent standard of living.  The primary purpose of any Government is to create employment and to protect those already employed.  I reject the attitude of the Minister for the Public Service to this.  I would like to think <Col N="847" /> that this debate would help streamline a course for the future.</P>
    <P>There is a huge capital investment about to take place in the telecommunications world.  I welcome this development.  Over the next five years the Minister will have available to him £175 million to develop our telephone system.  This is an enormous capital investment and, as it is an investment of a capital nature, it will be the duty of the Minister to ensure that it will at least pay its way and that interest can be paid on it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This is a fact of life and I am sure I speak for my party when I say that we would not expect the Minister for Finance, much less the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to negotiate a capital loan in the region of £175 million and at the same time subsidise a service which can be made a paying proposition.  I agree that in the early years of capital borrowing <Col N="848" /> interest charges can be very heavy.  It must be remembered that this is a gradual investment.  The capital borrowed for last year, this year and probably next year, will be repaid by the Minister.  I do not think that that system operates for loans. The first repayment would probably fall due in five or six years' time. Therefore, the charges for the repayment of capital at this time would have no bearing on the capital invested by the Minister last year and to be invested this year.  Of course, this capital will have to be serviced. Interest rates on borrowings today are very substantial but this loan was negotiated by the Minister at a very reasonable rate two years ago.  If this rate can be held over the next five years, that will be a very satisfactory arrangement.</P>
      <P>I said before in this House that I believe if we had borrowed more on the capital budget ten or fifteen years ago we could have built houses, hospitals and so on, at a faster rate.  We should take up this loan as soon as possible and deploy it for the purposes for which it was negotiated.  This is simple economics.  If the Minister has the personnel at hand&mdash;and this is a big factor&mdash;if he can succeed in charting a proper course of development within his Department and if he can get as many phones installed within the next two or three years as possible, he will find he has effected considerable sayings having regard to wage rates in five years time.</P>
      <P>There is very little likelihood that inflation will be brought under control soon.  Wages alone will erode that £175 million if it is spread over eight or nine years.  We would get out of that loan, if it is fully utilised within the next two or three years, 25 per cent or even 40 per cent more than if it were invested in seven years' time.  We will find that the normal type of equipment, cabling and technical machinery, necessary for this development will be increased by 40 per cent in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity now which other Departments have not got.  He has two things going for him at this time.  First, he has this huge waiting list in the region of 40,000, <Col N="849" /> of people who want phones installed and are prepared to pay for them. Also, he could make a valuable contribution to our unemployment situation because if this project were expanded far beyond what it is today we would be able to reduce unemployment irrespective of whether it is manual labour or technical work.  I do not know what provision is made in the Department for recruitment of technical staff.  Must they be all trained within the Department as installers or technicians? May they be recruited from the private sector?  I was told by an electrician five or six months ago that there are many electricians unemployed who could be usefully employed in the Department. Other qualified people are also unemployed and the Department could absorb a certain number of them. I do not say the Minister would cure the unemployment problem completely but he could alleviate it if he embarked on this capital project.  Nobody would criticise him if he came back here in 12 months and said he had taken up 40 per cent or 70 per cent of the capital loan now allocated to him.  He would be congratulated on every side because he would have contributed to our economic development.  He would create the cash flow which is vitally important today right through the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister could utilise this situation fully if he develops the project along the right lines.  I accept, as the Minister said some time ago, that we may not get the full effects of telephone capital development in a short period.  It is a slow undertaking and you do not take decisions overnight and cancel those decisions 12 months later.  It is an on-going situation and must be developed on progressive lines which must also be business lines.  The telephone section of the Department especially will have to be so structured as to pay its way. When people are prepared to instal telephones&mdash;and that is how the pattern is developing&mdash;they must want them.  Seeing that the Minister has the money available and that it is desirable for economic purposes I think such development by the Minister has great potential in the next year or so <Col N="850" /> to help out on the economic front. Industry is facing very great difficulties because it has no customers and has high unit costs and low purchasing power.  Naturally, there is a contraction.  That cannot be said of the Department which is expanding. Looking through the figures supplied by the Department you find that business in the postal and telephone sectors has increased enormously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Because of that we argue that at least some of the increases the Minister is now seeking should have been absorbed by buoyancy.  The prices commission, no matter what applications are submitted, will always consider buoyancy.  If you submit accounts for this year seeking increases for 1976 the commission will take into account what buoyancy will exist in the following year and you find that of the applications submitted, the percentage sought and the percentage conceded are never the same.  That is a principle that has been expounded by various Ministers, that part of the increase sought should be met by buoyancy and economy.  We concede that there is buoyancy in every business.  That has to be so with inflation and increased GNP.  Increased GNP would probably be reflected more in the business sector than in the Department but it would still show in the Department. It has shown up there.  While I have not figures for previous years, it is noted that the Department in the year ending 31st December, 1974, spent about £54 million.  I have no doubt that was a big increase on previous years.  That is what is meant by expanding a business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Department is the only one I know that has this cash flow and it must be looked on as a business venture.  Down through the years, taking one year with another, it has succeeded in paying its way. Certainly, the telephone section has always had a surplus except in the past few years.  If the Minister thinks that we might criticise borrowing for that purpose he would be wrong; we <Col N="851" /> would welcome capital development. We have always welcomed it.  When we were in Government we went ahead with capital development of roads, schools and various other projects.</P>
    <P>If the present trend continues and a good hard look is not taken at the efficiency of the Department the Minister can work out what exactly the development of the telephone service will be like in the next three or four years.  Will we return in two or three years' time, after the Government have borrowed and spent something in the region of £175 million on the development of the telephone service, to find there is no improvement in the situation?  That would be simply intolerable.  If the trend for more telephones continues then the Minister will have to increase proportionately the cost of postal services to the public to meet the deficit that will result.  Increasing the cost of services is a bad thing.  I would like to encourage people to use the telephone. It will be a bad day for the Post Office if the time comes when the householder will only use the telephone in times of emergency instead of using it as a means of communication with relatives and friends.  That could very easily be the evolution if the cost of the service goes on increasing. I should like to see the telephone develop along the lines where there would be no hesitation in using it eight or nine times in the day.  That would bring a greater return and the telephone would be an important asset in every household.  It is along these lines the Minister should be directing his attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the current deficit and forecast that the deficit for next year would be £24 million odd.  That does not take into consideration any crisis that might occur in 1976.  It was not a matter of breaking even.  The impression I got was that this increase would bring in £24 million, the money necessary to meet the deficit next year.  If I were reading that balance sheet I would interpret it as meaning that this time <Col N="852" /> 12 months the Department would break even.</P>

The figures in the Book of Estimates are utter rubbish. I will not predict how wages will rise next year.  That is for the Government to decide.  With the way the cost of living is going I can see the Minister back here in 12 months' time showing another deficit if the present policy continues and the Minister fails to exercise some restraint in his own Department.  His colleagues in Government will also have to exercise restraint.  If restraint is not exercised the effect in the private and commercial sectors will be adverse.  The Minister said the figure was .204.  I should like him to check that out with the Confederation of Irish Industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Communication is all important in rural areas and I do not have to tell the Minister the difficulties the business sector has been experiencing over the past two or three years, that sector of our economy struggling for markets and operating on a very tight margin.  Their problems will now be increased and the Minister knows they may take more severe measures <Col N="853" /> than we are advocating here with regard to employment and production. I doubt if the Minister would like that evolution.  What the Minister is doing will create more unemployment.</P>
    <P>In a recent newspaper report our telephone service was reckoned to be one of the worst in Europe.  With the capital now available to the Minister may we hope in the not-too-distant future for an improved service?  A proper telephone service is of vital importance to the proper development of our economy, particularly since we became members of the European Community and people here are now communicating with Brussels and other European capitals every day of the week.</P>
    <P>I should like now to thank the Minister for the copy of his speech to the Chamber of Commerce which he so kindly sent me.  I found it informative. We tabled this motion in what we considered to be the best interests of the country and the State.  We ask the Minister to submit his proposals, to stand the test which the majority of businessmen have to do.  Indeed, I believe it would be good for his Department. I am not saying that some increases would not be recommended. In this day and age we are sufficiently mature to recognise that fact&mdash;that the <Col N="854" /> National Prices Commission would have recommended increases, when the Minister could have come into this House better armed than he is now but it is a bad practice, and a bad practice for business people generally.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a second reading to the Bill on the grounds that it contains no provision for an all-Ireland Court, is unworkable and is inconsistent with Ireland's obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights, and is repugnant to the Constitution, in that it contravenes Articles 3 and 38.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy J. Lynch.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to follow on the inevitable turmoil of a division, particularly when the subject matter at issue is one which evokes such a deep sense of feeling and almost of embarrassment.  I quote from memory Sir Charles Gavan Duffy when he left this country for Australia after the failure of the Independent Irish Party in the 1850s. He said, from memory, &ldquo;I leave Ireland like a corpse upon the dissecting table.&rdquo;  Addressing myself to the subject of this Bill, I feel a little in the <Col N="857" /> same mood as Gavan Duffy felt 100 or so years ago.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Labour Party, I followed Deputy O'Connell's contribution and to some extent I will be repetitive of some things he had to say but I hope that you, Sir, will be ready to allow me a little latitude for the reasons, first, the importance of the issue, secondly, that I rarely speak in this House and when I do speak, I have never been known to detain it unduly and, thirdly, that it is impossible to discuss the Bill before the House without discussing the implications of two other Bills, the original Offences Against the State Act introduced at the commencement of the second world war and the amendment of that Act introduced and passed successfully in 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one way I am going to make a very hawkish contribution to this debate.  For example, I disagree with Deputy O'Connell on one point, that is, his reference to the minority in the North.  As far as I am concerned, there is only one minority in this country and it is the minority which defies the aspirations of the vast majority of the people of this country for the unification of the island of Ireland and I am sick and tired of reference being made to a minority in the North of Ireland which is based upon historical accident or a Plantation in the middle of the 17th century.  I dissent from this point. This Bill to me presents a heartbreaking dilemma.  I have often been accused of parading my conscience in public, of &ldquo;agonising in public&rdquo;, as one political correspondent used to say. There is no question of that this time because I have made up my mind about what I am going to do about this Bill.  At the same time, I object to references, as I say, to a majority and a minority in the North, in that historic phenomenon, the Six Counties, which was forced on this country by the trickery, perhaps, of the most deceptive politician of the twentieth century in the British Isles, David Lloyd George. To speak in the context of that imaginary phenomenon, Northern Ireland, of a majority and a minority is something which I simply do not understand. Perhaps three degrees and a <Col N="858" /> professorship in Trinity College and a fellowship thereof do not qualify me, comparably, with some of my colleagues to speak about this Bill.</P>
    <P>I speak about this Bill with a profound sadness, a sadness greater than that I have ever felt in addressing any representative assembly in 25 years of political life. I speak of it with sadness because of its details, quite unnecessary details as far as I am concerned.  Burglary, for example, becomes a felony punishable with imprisonment for life.  I have no time for the burglar, but imprisonment for life is really ridiculous.  Housebreaking in or out&mdash;I am no solicitor, but I put this to the Minister who is a solicitor&mdash;having committed that felony the sentence is increased from seven years to 14 years maximum.  Attempted robbery, which under the Larceny Act, 1916, carries a maximum of five years does, as I understand it, carry a potential maximum of life imprisonment under this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said, I speak with profound sadness, but I am not trotting my conscience around asking others what I should do with it.  Ernest Bevin said of George Lansbury in 1931 that he was taking his conscience from one to another round the Cabinet table asking them what to do with it.  I do not attain to the eminence of the Cabinet table nor do I trot my conscience around.  The fact remains, nevertheless, that this measure seeks the extension and the solidification of two Acts. I say &ldquo;solidification&rdquo; deliberately because it institutionalises, as Deputy O'Connell correctly pointed out, on a permanent basis an Act opposed by the Irish Labour Party.  When at the beginning of the second world war the first Offences Against the State Act was introduced to this House, which is the progenitor of the Bill we are discussing today, the only party to oppose it was the Labour Party.  The tellers on that occasion were Deputy Thomas Kyne, who is still happily with us, and the late Deputy Richard Corish, father of the leader of the Labour Party and the only Labour candidate to stand in the 1922 election.</P>

      <P>I am afraid we will have to argue about that later.  The late Deputy Richard Corish, whose son is now Tánaiste and leader of my party, was the only person to intervene in the 1919 election.  In that election he stood as a republican, not on a socialist ticket, because the Irish Labour Party decided in their wisdom not to contest that election.  This may seem irrelevant but it is not so because it bears on the attitude I will take as an elected representative of the Irish people towards this Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill attempts to extend to Northern Ireland a previous Bill. When my party were in opposition they had no hesitation in their attitude to the Bill which they now wish to extend to people arrested in Northern Ireland.  I quote from the debate in the Dáil at that time. Deputy Desmond said:</P>
      <P>This Bill is essentially an exercise in internal political party power.  A golden opportunity was presented to the Taoiseach to screw the Fine Gael Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I apologise for this phrase.  It is not mine.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and have the Labour Party thrown in as a bolster.  Its purpose is to preserve Fianna Fáil in power for another four years.  One certainly must describe the Bill by saying it is Fascist in content if not intent.  It is certainly reminiscent of the denial of the opportunity for a fair trial, which one saw in Nazi Germany.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey, now Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, said:</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party are totally opposed to this Bill.  We realise that by doing so we will be misrepresented by Fianna Fáil.  We realise it will be misrepresented as encouragement and support for illegal organisations.  This Bill can only be described as a pollution of justice.  Instead of introducing legislation at this time we should be rallying to the defence of democracy, but this Bill goes a long way to undermining it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> The present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said:</P>
    <P>This Bill is a fraud.  The real objects of this Bill are (1) to refurbish the Government's &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; image, (2) to provide a retrospective alibi for the Government's inaction to date, and (3) to try to put the Opposition in a position where their responsible concern for the rule of law can be misrepresented as covert sympathy with lawbreakers.</P>

      <P>It is a quotation from <i>The Irish Times</i>.  This is the Bill which we not merely administer when in Government but which we seek to extend to the North.  It is, if I may be allowed a mild diversion from the subject, on all fours with the Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill.  I sat on the Opposition side of the House and listened with amazed adulation to the filibustering speech of the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs against the Forcible Entry Bill.  It, too, is not merely on the Statute Book but has been invoked within the last 24 hours.  Perhaps this reaction of mine to the idea that one should think one thing in Opposition and another in Government is an example of my innocence and my incapacity to take any active part in public life or in politics.  Perhaps the most honourable and decent thing for me to do would be to quit public life tonight as one member of what is now the Opposition once did.  I am eternally turned back to the quotation from Alexander Pope and again I speak from memory:</P>
      <P>To place and power all public spirit tends.</P>
      <P>In place and power all public spirit ends.</P>
      <P>This appears to be our attitude towards measures which, from those Opposition benches, we filibustered to a point where the closure had to be applied to allow them to go through. I begin to wonder what company I am keeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> I am, through a succession of accidents, an educated man, for what that is worth, educated in the academic sense, probably worth absolutely nothing.  I was brought up to believe that law should possess both value and validity.  I remember Sir Ernest Barker defining this in one of his greatest books.  Validity can be given to any law by an assembly like this but does it possess value?  In particular in a country which is predominantly Roman Catholic and dominated by the natural law concept of value does it possess value?  If we pass a law here that all redheaded men ought to be automatically executed, does that make that law good law at once, a law to be administered by the courts?  I do not think so.  The German judges did not take the message very well.  Eichmann pleaded that the administration of law as laid down by the State was his sole purpose and function.  The same argument was used in that remarkable film &ldquo;Judgment at Nuremberg&rdquo;.  This did not stop the outraged conscience of Western Europe from imprisoning the judges who administered laws which, in the view of civilised society, fell outside the purview of the normal human conscience.  The same applies here.  I think I was the only TD with the guts to attend the trials of Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Daithí Ó Conaill. The spectacle of people being sentenced to, in one case, six months imprisonment and, in the other case, 12 months, simply on the word of a senior policeman, reduced me to a state bordering on sickness.  Surely there is a time when a judge simply says: &ldquo;I will not administer this law because it is bad law&rdquo;.  In my view, this Bill is bad law.</P>
    <P>As I, at 40 years of age and a professor of political science, who has read some books, look at this Bill, I feel, perhaps, that I should burn every book I have read about justice and about the principle of being innocent before being proved guilty, forget about the whole lot, because this State seems to have defined a form of justice special to itself.  I also think this Bill is extremely regrettable because it has been shown in every <Col N="862" /> country of the civilised world that repressive legislation is counterproductive, that it only makes martyrs, and that making martyrs only breeds generations of more people prepared to indulge in violence.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure the other day at the European Parliament of talking to a very close friend of mine, a Conservative MP, Hugh Dykes, who sits for Harrow, who said that in no circumstances could he countenance the bringing back of the death penalty.  I thought this was a brave and courageous statement for an Englishman to make at a moment in time when the atmosphere between our two countries is so tense.  No one knows this better than I do because no one in this House catches more aeroplanes that go through Heathrow than I do.  Furthermore, in furtherance of this Bill we are being asked to take cognisance of the use of the bombs which have gone off at Dublin Airport.  That trick was tried before and it worked.  It did not work where the Labour Party was concerned.  I, for one, said straight out that I did not believe that the Provisional IRA were responsible for the use of the bombs in O'Connell Street on that famous day and I took the dangerous risk of ringing a senior contact I had in the Provisional IRA from this very House who gave me his word of honour that the bombs were not Provisional IRA bombs.  Nor do I believe that the bombs planted at Dublin Airport were Provisional IRA bombs.  Yet, to say this is to identify oneself with violence.  This is the infuriating thing to me.</P>
    <P>To attack a Bill like this because it is intrinsically, to me, a horrendous, appalling Bill, is inevitably twisted into a defence of violence.  I am sure, if the Government have not exhausted their store of speakers, they will rise one after another after me accusing me of associating myself with men of violence.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We have to face the fact that this State was born in violence, that the tradition of violence runs right through it and runs right through its history books and runs right <Col N="863" /> through its newspaper articles until very recently and I am not prepared to stand here and see history rewritten by some gentleman on the front bench who would have us believe that Redmond and Dillon would have attained all they wished if only Pearse and Connolly had not got in the way &mdash;and de Valera&mdash;I give you that.</P>
    <P>Labour was founded by a gunman who paid the ultimate penalty for his use of a revolver.  Fine Gael was founded by perhaps the most sophisticated assassin of his generation.  I am not saying that in criticism of him.  He is possibly the greatest hero in my entire life.  A picture of him hangs on my wall at home&mdash;a very rare picture&mdash; but he was an assassin.</P>
    <P>We cannot simply condemn the Price sisters, the rest, to eternal punishment because they have inherited a tradition which built us and I am not afraid to say that even though I know I am taking my life in my hands politically in saying it.  This is the tradition we were born out of and the Minister for Justice would not be sitting where he is sitting at this moment if Pearse had not stood aside and Tom Clarke had shot down the door of the General Post Office in 1916. Anyone who says anything else about Irish history I will take on in free historical debate, because I am an historian, and one of some repute.</P>
    <P>Of the Bill itself, as I have said, I detest it, I loathe it, I loathe the manner in which it is spread out to include acts which to my non-legal mind do not seem relevant.  I hope it will be declared unconstitutional.  If there is any fund got up to try to make it unconstitutional I shall be the first to contribute to said fund.  That does not make me a man of violence.  it just makes me a realist.  Lloyd George said he would never sit down with murderers. About two years later he was sitting down with Collins whom he called the greatest murderer in the British Isles.</P>
    <P>I want to give some of the background to this Bill and I am leading up, like a good actor&mdash;and I hope the sneer is evident in that remark&mdash;to what I finally want to say.  This Bill was never <Col N="864" /> discussed by the Labour Party.  A group of bewildered Senators was summoned by telegram from every art and part of Ireland to introduce the Bill in the Seanad after an unseemly squabble in the Dáil over the possibility of introducing it here.  The analogy was made, with somewhat unfortunate reality, by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach of the Preservation of Wild Life Bill which had similarly been introduced in the Seanad.  This was deemed a sufficient analogy to introduce this thing&mdash;this thing&mdash;which semi-recognises the Northern RUC and semi-recognises their methods.</P>
    <P>As a result of the meeting of those Senators a meeting was called by Deputy Desmond to discuss the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill.  No such meeting was ever held.  We were presented with a resolution in the name of the Minister for Local Government saying: &ldquo;If you do not vote for the Bill the Whip is automatically removed from you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Years ago&mdash;1964, I think it was&mdash; when I was a very young academic, I wrote an article in <i>Studies</i> called &ldquo;Ireland: The End of An Era&rdquo;, in which I said that apparently Ireland was governed on the principle of what the English would call Buggins's turn. As C.P. Snow would say, every man is entitled to quote his own clichés, and so it appears to be.  The clarion call of the Coalition to the nation seems to be: &ldquo;We stink but they stink more than we stink or they have been stinking longer than we have been. So, let us stink a little bit longer and then we will get our pensions and you can get them back again and have their stink all over again.&rdquo;  If that is democracy I do not know what I became a Professor of Political Science for.  That appears to be the clarion call we are sending out to the young people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am not a lawyer.  I do not fully understand this Bill.  Thank God, I am not a lawyer.  I object to the principle that citizens of the Republic are delivered into the custody of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.  I do not understand if evidence will be taken from informers.  I do not understand if they will be identified.  I do not <Col N="865" /> understand if they can claim privilege. I do not understand if they can be interrogated.  Certainly following upon Deputy O'Connell here, if by any tests like that of the Compton Report, we are to judge the techniques of the Royal Ulster Constabulary then to deliver citizens of the Republic, no matter how heinous their crimes&mdash;and I regard the placing of bombs in public places as a heinous crime, a heinous and indefensible crime&mdash;at the same time from what little I know of the Royal Ulster Constabulary I would not wish that any citizen of my country should be delivered to their tender mercies.</P>
    <P>I am almost finished.  I have gone on longer than usual.  Finally, this Bill seems to me to copperfasten the 1972 amendment to the Offences Against the State Act into the legal system by the use of the commissioner.  I object to this.  I do not know what role this commissioner plays.  One commissioner is a personal friend of mine, a man I admire greatly, and I wonder what role he is expected to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>As I say, I have left the last point to the end, like a good actor.  Again, I hope the sneer against myself is relevant.  I intend to vote for this Bill.  Hugh Gaitskell said on a different occasion on a different issue that he would stay in the Labour Party to fight, fight and fight again to change its views on a certain issue. There is nothing that would please certain people in the Labour Party more than that I should ride off into the sunset on a white horse like John Wayne, only slightly shorter and slightly fatter, so that they could get on with the business of manipulating the nation.  No, I am made of sterner stuff than that.</P>
    <P>My friends in Fianna Fáil have listened to me with a great deal more attention than the Coalition Members. There are only three Deputies, including the Minister, on the Government benches but Fianna Fáil Deputies have paid me the courtesy of listening to me with attention.  I admire the unity of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I admire the way it has never broken its ranks really definitively since it was <Col N="866" /> founded in 1926.  I admire its solidity. I have been told from time to time since 1945 that it was about to disintegrate. I have never believed that to be so, and I do not believe it to be so now.</P>
    <P>I would remind Members of the Fianna Fáil Party that there was an occasion when a Deputy, whom I shall not name, went through the lobbies to vote confidence in a Government, a Member of whom he had been very personally abusive about.  That night there was a lot of invective and unpleasantness about that Member and about the Member of the Government.  It did not come from me.  In the same way, I am wedded to the Labour Party.  I believe it to be the repository of socialism in this country.  I regret the Redmondite drift which is developing in it as evidenced by this Bill.</P>
    <P>It was Martin Corry of the Fianna Fáil Party who once said to me when I was a very young man that you can say what you like but what you do with your feet is the important thing and &ldquo;my feet&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;will always go into the Fianna Fáil lobby&rdquo;.  In the same way I feel bound in all honesty to vote for a Bill which I detest and despise and I hope it is found unconstitutional.  There will be no more reluctant pair of feet going up those steps than mine.  I crave your indulgence in that I could have invented a diplomatic illness or a visit to Strasbourg and save myself the agony of making this speech today, and declaring my position outright.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset what has been said in this debate previously by the Leader of this party and a number of other speakers on this side of the House, but, nevertheless, I think it bears repetition having regard to what we heard from the Government side.  As far as this party are concerned, we fully and unreservedly support the objective of trying to ensure that there is no corner of the 32 counties of Ireland in which there is sanctuary for those who are engaging in bombing, knee-capping and worse crimes. From whatever side they come, whatever <Col N="867" /> alleged political objective or aim they claim to be serving, that is an objective we want to see accomplished. This Bill will not accomplish that.  Unfortunately, I rather suspect that the Government know that.</P>
      <P>If one examines the statements of some Members of the Government, not least the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, it is almost impossible to escape the suspicion and, indeed, the conclusion that the real purpose of this Bill has nothing to do with the arrest and trial of what are called fugitive offenders but rather with internal politics in this part of the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice introduced this Bill in a reasoned, moderate way but even he found it impossible to avoid this tainted approach towards the end of his speech.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs speaking in this Bill and reported in the Official Report, 20th November, 1975, at column 1734, said the following:</P>
      <P>At the beginning of his speech Deputy Lynch said that he supports the motives behind this Bill.  I accept that in a rather gingerly way regarding Deputy Lynch personally...</P>
      <P>When you hear the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs saying that, it will be agreed that it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the purpose certainly of that Minister and probably of the Government as a whole in bringing forward this Bill has nothing to do with the arrest, trial and punishment of the kind of offenders at whom it is purported to be aimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole effort on the part of the Government appears to be to paint the Fianna Fáil Party as an anti-law and order party and to paint the Coalition as the defenders of law and order here.  There could, of course, be no greater travesty of the truth than that, and very well the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and most of the other Members of the Government know.  If they had any tendency to want to forget, the evidence is there for all to see.  Deputy Thornley to whom we have just <Col N="868" /> listened reminded them of the occasion in December, 1972, in this House when their attitude to law and order and the very necessary measures being brought before this House revealed their approach.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any further misrepresentation in this regard, I want to draw attention once more to what was said in the recently issued Fianna Fáil restatement of policy in regard to Northern Ireland, a matter that was very largely ignored by many commentators in their references to that statement.  I would remind the House that twice in the first paragraph of that statement the question of violence was dealt with and repudiated.  The first sentence sets out as a central aim of Fianna Fáil policy the achievement of the unification of Ireland by peaceful means.  The next sentence refers to the fact that we totally reject violence in the achievement of this aim.  It should not be necessary in this House to have to say that or to have to say it in this country but politics in recent years have been reduced to a level at which the truth and reality find it difficult to shine through the fog of distortion and misrepresentation which is daily emanating from sources on the other side of the House or friendly to the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>That is unfortunate.  This Bill is one of very great importance, one that deserves detailed discussion and debate. It is regrettable that discussion should be clouded by this alleged issue of whether or not Fianna Fáil are supporting law and order and whether or not the Coalition are doing likewise. That is unfortunate and regrettable but it has not happened by accident as the record shows.  It is a deliberate policy decision on the Government side to present the matter in that way.  There can be short-term advantage in approaching matters of this kind in a way that distorts reality and conceals the truth but it can only be short-term advantage because in the long run the ordinary people who vote all of us into or out of office and into or out of this House will not be fooled by that kind of approach.  This is the great virtue of democracy put so well by Abraham Lincoln.  His saying has become a <Col N="869" /> cliché but nevertheless true for all that, that you cannot fool all the people all the time.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage when the policies in general being adumbrated by the Government have been changing in character in their general approach to the whole problem of Northern Ireland and, of course, that approach colours their attitude in bringing forward this Bill.  I have to qualify that statement to make it fully accurate.  It would be more true to say that the attitude of the Taoiseach has been changing and, perhaps, the attitude of some members of the Government has been changing with him. The attitude of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of the Minister for Foreign Affairs has not changed&mdash;I grant them that: it has been consistent; what they are saying now they said on these benches in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I recall, in the course of the last general election campaign, taking part in a radio programme with the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the present Minister for Foreign Affairs and the question of policy in regard to Northern Ireland came up.  The question was put to me as to whether, if the Coalition were elected, Fianna Fáil would support the approach of the Coalition in their policy regarding Northern Ireland. My answer to that question then was that if the policy followed by a Coalition Government were to be the one which had been consistently advocated in this House by the present Taoiseach as leader of the Opposition then we in Fianna Fáil would certainly support it because the line he was taking basically in regard to Northern Ireland was the line we were taking and it was one we agreed with and it seemed to be the one that represented the general consensus in this part of the country.  I went on to point out that the two gentlemen present with me, the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, had been advocating policies different from those of the leader of the Opposition at that time and I said that if their policies were to be followed by a Coalition Government, <Col N="870" /> Fianna Fáil would not support and would not agree with such policies.</P>
    <P>For some time after the Coalition took office, although there were some members of the Government who had policies to the contrary, the policy generally being followed was that which had been enunciated by the present Taoiseach as leader of the Opposition.  But gradually a change took place and we went through such phases as those when the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said that he was not actively working for Irish unity and when we had the statement from the present Minister for Defence that under no circumstances, no matter what doomsday situation occurred in the North, would the Irish Army ever cross the Border.  But the most telling development as far as I am concerned was the speech made by the Taoiseach at Blackrock in which he said that the Irish Government and the British Government had made their efforts in regard to the North and the time had come to leave the matter to the people of Northern Ireland.  That was totally contrary to what he had always been saying before and to the line we had always taken and continue to take.</P>
    <P>I confess that I have amazed at the number of times that I have read in newspapers references to Fianna Fáil reaction to that kind of statement ending up with &ldquo;it is believed that this development will put some strain on the bi-partisan policy but it will hold.&rdquo;  What bi-partisan policy?  How could you expect to have anything that could be even remotely called a bi-partisan policy&mdash;or a unified approach as the leader of this party would prefer to call it&mdash;on the grounds that we have never been, as an Opposition, involved in the formulation of policy?  There cannot be a unified approach in this House if that is the kind of approach we get from the Government because we totally repudiate the concept behind that, a concept which places the control of events in Northern Ireland in the hands of those who have consistently shown that they are unwilling <Col N="871" />&mdash;even if they are capable of doing so&mdash;to agree to any arrangement whereby reasonable fair play and justice will be given to all the people living in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I say this because I think it is important that we should understand the way policies have or lack of policy has developed in the last few years.  We should not be under any illusions about what has been happening.  I would find it difficult to pay a great deal of attention to very much that was said by Deputy Thornley but I could not disagree with him when he said that at the moment the policy of the Labour Party in regard to Northern Ireland appeared to be very much on a Redmondite line.</P>
    <P>I could not disagree with that. Whatever one may think about the approach of Fianna Fáil in this regard it is not a Redmondite line.  But the stage has now been reached, I believe, where the line being advocated by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has now taken over and is accepted and publicly expounded by the Taoiseach so that there is no longer any room for doubt that it represents the policy of the Government. That policy appears to me to be one of giving the people a choice between, on the one hand, the approach of the Provisional IRA or fringe organisations of a similar mentality and, on the other, a kind of West Briton approach which is primarily concerned with keeping things as quiet as possible and not with trying to make progress towards not alone Irish unity but peace with justice in this country, a policy prepared to sacrifice any possible advance along that line to the short-term political advantage of presenting itself as standing for peace against those who would take the Provo line.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that as far as we are concerned and, I believe, as far as the great majority of the people of this country are concerned, we reject totally the approach of the Provisional IRA and all that it connotes. Equally, we reject the Redmondite West Briton approach enunciated by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="872" /> and now Government policy.  As far as we in this Party are concerned, our approach as enunciated in that recent restatement is the right approach and the one which is in the great tradition of Irish nationalism and Irish republicanism, that approach which will never concede that this country has not got the right to unity and to independence, an approach determined to ensure that unity in that sense means unity and not something imposed by force, not an imaginary unity achieved by the creation of political structures and the abolition of the Border but a unity of all the Irish people.</P>
    <P>In that approach, we believe it is vitally important not only to the achievement of national objectives and aspirations but vitally important to the ordinary people North and South in their day-to-day lives that they be given some prospect of being freed from the incubus of self-appointed paramilitary groups taking it unto themselves to have the power to condemn people to death, or to maim them, or to blow them up at random.  If there is one thing the ordinary people North and South are united on I believe it is that they want to get the paramilitary bombers and maimers off their backs and I would be very surprised if they are not prepared to go a very long way to achieve that aim and, if they are to achieve it, one of the things that has got to be done is what I said at the outset was one of the objectives that we fully support, and without reservation, and that is to bring about a situation in which there is no corner of the 32 Counties in which the bombers and maimers and knee-cappers can find sanctuary.  If we are agreed on that on both sides of this House, then the question is how do you achieve it.  What is the most effective way to achieve it?</P>
    <P>I think it is very unfortunate that the Government should have got itself into the situation in which it is in regard to this Bill.  I suspect members of the Government know in their hearts that this Bill will not work and that it is largely window dressing.  I think the members of the Government have been subjected to a <Col N="873" /> great deal of pressure and propaganda. The Minister for Justice knows just what the British propaganda machine can do.  He has learned that in the last few days.  As far as I am concerned, I fully support his efforts to refute and repudiate the false British propaganda we have been getting in the last few days.  This is nothing new to me.  The Fianna Fáil Government was subjected to this time after time and I regret to say that the British propaganda machine at that time was aided and abetted by one person who is now a member of the Government.  I am referring to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the Minister for Justice of the articles written by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when he was on this side of the House.  They were published in <i>The Observer</i> newspaper and they were used all over the world by the British propaganda service.  If I found an article or a speech of mine used by the British propaganda service, I would examine my conscience.  It is possible for a clever propaganda service to so misrepresent one as to be able to use something once but to be able to use it more than once is different. I hope the Minister for Justice when he is trying to deal with the propaganda machine and when he knows the reasons why it is in action at the moment, knows what it is doing and how unscrupulous it is, will bear in mind the dangers attaching to misrepresenting the position of the Opposition in this House, the dangers not only of providing propaganda material for the British machine but the much more serious danger of representing to loyalist paramilitary groups an excuse for further outrage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall conclude on this aspect of the matter by pointing out that some time ago, and again in the course of the debate, I challenged any spokesman on behalf of the Government to point out what was wrong with the Fianna Fáil statement in regard to Northern Ireland.  Nobody has taken up that challenge except the Minister for Posts <Col N="874" /> and Telegraphs who I think could fairly accurately be said, when pressed, contended that what was wrong was its timing.  That is a fair enough comment. Anyone can have his own views on timing.  But no amount of disagreement with the timing of that statement can justify the allegation that our opposition to this Bill is based on sympathy with the Provos or with an anti-law and order attitude.</P>
    <P>I would further point out that for hundreds of years in this country the aim of all national opinion was to get the British out.  If any member of the Government does not share that aim now, he should say so.  Nobody, and certainly not this party, wants to see the British get out and leave a Congo situation behind them but we do want to see the British encourage the unity of Ireland by agreement, and take the necessary steps to bring about and encourage such agreement in the interim.</P>
    <P>The Leader of this party set out a number of objections to this Bill.  One of them fell under the heading of its doubtful constitutional validity.  Some people have suggested that we should simply say: well, in our view it is unconstitutional and leave it at that; that this is ultimately a matter for the courts.  It is true that it is ultimately a matter for the courts, but it is the duty of a Member of this House, and I would submit in particular of the Opposition, if it believes that a measure coming before the House is of doubtful constitutional validity, to say so and to spell out the reasons for that.  We have spelled out the reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice in his speech introducing the Bill, presumably based on what he had heard in the other House, tried to anticipate some of the arguments.  Subsequently the Attorney General spoke in this debate and dealt with some aspects of the objections put forward.  With due deference to the Attorney General, I would suggest that his approach was rather simplistic.  He quoted various authorities to show that every sovereign state can have extra-territorial jurisdiction, a proposition with which, of course, we would not <Col N="875" /> quarrel.  Further to the argument put forward by the Minister for Justice, he referred to certain pieces of legislation passed by this House in the past&mdash;the Foyle Fisheries Act, the Air Navigation and Transport Act and the Extradition Act were amongst those referred to.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister for Justice that there may be a misunderstanding here.  I have read and listened to the speech of the Minister for Justice.  I have read the speech of the Attorney General and it seems to me that the argument here is at cross purposes.  We are not arguing on this side of the House that this State has not got, and cannot have, any extra territorial jurisdiction.  I put it to the Minister for Justice that none of the legislation to which he referred involves what is entailed in this Bill, that all of that legislation envisages persons who are accused of offences under that legislation, offences, perhaps, committed outside the jurisdiction, being tried in our courts, the whole of their trial taking place in our courts and, being in custody, where they were in custody, in the hands of the Garda, were answerable to this House through the Minister for Justice.  Nowhere in any of that legislation referred to by the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General will there be found provision for persons having to put themselves in the custody of a police force not subject to this House in order to exercise their right to be present at their trial or their right to cross-examine witnesses.</P>
    <P>Nor is there, in any of the legislation referred to, any provision for the conduct of the trial concerned in courts which are not set up under the Constitution outside the jurisdiction. It is very possible to envisage, and, indeed, it is very likely to occur if this Bill is passed and implemented, a situation in which somebody arrested, say, in Dublin and accused of an offence under this Bill, committed in Belfast, is tried where the only evidence given here would be evidence of arrest, say, by the Garda and the rest of the evidence given on commission in relation to the whole of the alleged <Col N="876" /> offence in the North, in a court not under our jurisdiction, with judges present from here unable to take any part in the proceedings by way of putting questions but merely suggesting questions to the Commissioner in the North.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there is no precedent whatever for that in any of the legislation to which he referred&mdash;the Foyle Fisheries Act, the Air Navigation and Transport Act or the Extradition Act.  I suggest it is rather simplistic of the Attorney General to talk, as he did, and not to advert to the provisions of this Bill which require the kind of things I have outlined and, indeed, other things for which there is absolutely no precedent.</P>

      <P>Perhaps this is where some confusion may have arisen because we do not contend, and could not contend, that there could not be, in any circumstances, extra territorial jurisdiction in regard to the commission of offences.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, I think a matter as I and other people have said which ultimately the courts will determine, but it seems to me that in regard to the kind of things involved, some of which I have outlined, the most fundamental principles of the rights of an accused in criminal law are being breached in this and there is no precedent for that kind of approach.  However, I do not propose to dwell unduly long on that aspect of the matter, but I do want to make it quite clear that as far as we are concerned, the case put forward by the Minister in introducing the Bill and subsequently by the Attorney General does not deal with a very fundamental issue which is involved here.</P>
      <P>There are some other aspects of the provisions of the Bill that give considerable cause for concern.  One of them has been referred to by a number of speakers but I think they bear a little repetition anyway, and it is this question of the RUC as at present constituted. It has been pointed out that the RUC is the subject of torture allegations in Strasbourg.  It is true that those proceedings were initiated by the former Government but they have been continued by the present Government who must, therefore, be assumed to know the nature of the allegations and the details of what occurred.  It is also true that the SDLP has found itself unable to give support to the RUC as at present constituted, and yet the whole structure envisaged in this Bill involves persons who want to maintain their right, if they are arrested in this jurisdiction and if evidence&mdash;perhaps the great bulk of it&mdash; at their trial is being given north of the Border, placing themselves in the custody of the RUC if they are to exercise their right to be present when the evidence is being given or to cross-examine the witnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in introducing the <Col N="878" /> Bill referred to the right to crossexamine&mdash;I am quoting from pages 17 and 18 of the Minister's script on that occasion&mdash;and said:</P>
    <P>It is quite true that one of the fundamental requirements of a fair trial is that the accused should have the right to cross-examine the witnesses against him.  This was made clear by the then Chief Justice Ó Dálaigh in giving the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case to which I referred earlier.  The case is in the matter of the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann (Privilege and Procedure) Act, 1970, and in the matter of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, and in the matter of Pádraic Haughey.  It is reported in (1971) Irish Reports at page 217 and the relevant section of the Supreme Court's decision begins at page 256.  On page 261 the Chief Justice said:</P>
    <P>As to the disallowance of cross-examination, an accused person has a right to cross-examine every witness for the prosecution, subject, in respect of any question asked, to the Court's power of disallowance on the grounds of irrelevancy.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>However, in fact both the Bill and the British Act expressly provide that an accused shall have the right to be present at the taking of evidence on commission and the right to cross-examine the witnesses. The latter right of course means that the accused's counsel or solicitor may cross-examine the witness on his behalf and that the accused, if unrepresented, may himself do so....</P>
    <P>That is all very well in theory, but what is the practice envisaged here? It is that the accused person must place himself, if he is to avail himself of that right, in the custody of the RUC in respect of whom, as I pointed out, there are outstanding charges of torture and the SDLP is unable to find it possible to give support to it. That is so whether the person is wanted on other charges or not, although it is true that an attempt is <Col N="879" /> made to give a degree of immunity on other charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is being unfair to himself.  It is not an attempt&mdash;there is a specific guarantee of immunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that he can give no guarantee in respect of immunity from arrest by the RUC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reciprocal piece of legislation and if it is not reciprocated in the letter and in the spirit, that is an end of it.  It is, if you like, the muscle of the thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I suggest to the Minister that this kind of thing is all very well in theory, but if he or I were in the position of being wanted by the RUC on some other charge, we would hesitate, to say the least, before we would rely on that guarantee and the strength, or the muscle as the Minister suggests, given to it by the threat to withdraw the whole operation if it is dishonoured?  I certainly would hesitate and I suggest that the Minister would hesitate if he found himself in that position.  Furthermore, the Minister has made reference to the right of the accused to be represented by solicitor and counsel, but it is also true that in order to be represented by solicitor and counsel, a man may find himself unable to have the solicitor and counsel practising in this jurisdiction whom he would want to have representing him.  He may find it impossible to have them acting for him at his trial.  Would the Minister accept that that is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that solicitors and counsel from this side of the Border have not got a right of audience at a trial in the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct, but they would have a right of audience at a commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But not at the trial. Does the Minister appreciate that in the kind of situation I have described where somebody is arrested here, <Col N="880" /> accused of an offence in the North, that the whole of the evidence other than the evidence of arrest here may be evidence of commission in the North, at his trial?  The judges concerned go along, hear this evidence and then presumably come back and give their verdict here.  That is not an impossible situation to envisage and that being so the bulk of the trial is taking place in the North and the bulk of the evidence is being given in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The solicitor and counsel engaged to represent the accused at his trial in this jurisdiction would be entitled to have a right of audience at the hearing of the evidence on commission in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister enlighten me in what circumstances they would be excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not be excluded at all in those circumstances. If the situation arose that the Northern authorities found in the North a fugitive offender from the South and his trial was to take place in the North he would have to be represented by people practising at the Northern Bar because there is no reciprocity in that regard, but the person found in the South, whose trial is taking place in the South, and where evidence may be on commission in the North, in that instance there is full right of audience for solicitor and counsel from the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but it is true that the judges concerned, the judges from the South, can be present, can listen to the evidence being presented but may not put questions themselves. They may suggest questions to the commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Which the commissioner has to put.  Of course, as the Deputy knows, in practice undue questioning from the bench is very often not appreciated by defending counsel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but nevertheless I am sure the Minister would agree also that sometimes the putting of questions from the bench and observation of the demeanour of the witness in response to the questions can be a vital matter in determining guilt or innocence.  I imagine the Minister can only regard as second best&mdash;I am putting it no worse than that&mdash;the procedure envisaged here for the purpose of obtaining evidence for criminal trials under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that it is not the same thing as putting the question oneself.  I do not know how the mechanics of it would be worked out, whether they would give a list of questions first or give a question and then one that would arise out of it, that they would suggest that and then that there would be a long interval before it would be put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the questions will arise from the proceedings. They cannot be anticipated in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but one might hear the witness decide on certain questions one wanted to have put, say, put three questions to the commissioner to put them.  I think the Minister would agree it is not the same thing as putting the questions oneself, and perhaps arising out of the answers putting another question that was not on the list of three that was already submitted.</P>

      <P>I suggest that this Bill is largely a window dressing operation, a whitewashing operation.  It is known it will not work and that it is on a par with the action that was taken by the Minister for Justice. When I say the Minister for Justice he was the Minister concerned but it was taken by the Government, not by the Minister for Justice on his own. This action was taken by him in regard to the Offences against the Person Act, 1861.  The Minister will recall that he made a statutory order under that in 1973 and we learned with great interest through all the official and unofficial hand-outs from the Government Information Services that this was a very special move by the Coalition to ensure that anybody accused of murder in Northern Ireland could be tried for it and convicted here in the South.  Not one single person has been tried under that provision and we know that that is not because no murders have been committed in Northern Ireland since. Unfortunately, that is not the explanation. It could be that the explanation is that no persons accused of such murders have come South within our jurisdiction.  If that is so, that would suggest that the great need for this Bill which we have been hearing about is not what we were told.</P>

Deputy Desmond at least was consistent in his opposition until his party went into Government but the Parliamentary Secretary was one who when the bombs went off shifted his ground very fast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous legislation is, of course, very relevant to consideration <Col N="886" /> of this matter, as Deputy Thornley pointed out.  I do not wish to pursue it and if the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to repudiate the approach of his party on that occasion, that is his business, not mine. We were told that this was a matter of extreme urgency.  The Minister for Justice in introducing the Second Stage of this Bill said&mdash;and I am quoting from his script:</P>
      <P>However, as I said at the outset, this argument imposes on those who raise it the duty, because of the urgency and the seriousness of the problem now facing us, to propound another solution that is immediately available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and on the following page he said:</P>
      <P>I would go so far as to say that those who criticise the Bill and condemn it run a serious risk of placing themselves on the side of the terrorists unless they can show convincingly and wellnigh conclusively that there is an alternative remedy immediately&mdash;and I emphasise immediately&mdash;available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does it strike anybody as odd that this immediate&mdash; emphasised immediate&mdash;necessity suddenly arises now?  Sunningdale was two years ago.  The report of the Law Commission, I think, was prepared in February and published in April, 1974.  The Bill was published in November of 1974.  This is December, 1975.  But, last week, how much time did this vitally urgent measure get in this House?  Two hours.  How much time was it getting this week until the criticism finally got home to the Government as to what they were doing?  Two hours or less; maybe it would not have been reached at all and then the Whip changed the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that this emphasised alleged urgency that we heard about from the Minister for Justice does not stand up.  Yet, according to the Minister for Justice, unless you accept this and produce an alternative which can be produced and operated immediately&mdash;emphasised&mdash;then one is in danger of being placed in the same camp as the terrorists.  That is a very revealing comment from the Minister for Justice and those who suport him, very revealing indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out that there is an alternative, that it was put forward and, strangely enough, the alternative was put forward originally, admittedly, from this side when we were in Government, but it was adopted by the present Government and it was put forward at Sunningdale and they believed in it then and it was rejected by the Law Commission on the grounds that it could not be immediately implemented because it would need a referendum in this country.  Is anybody seriously suggesting <Col N="888" /> that it could not have been implemented by now, as far as that kind of delay was concerned, that it would all be over now?  Of course not.  The Minister knows that.  If it was good then, it is good now.  What has changed?  I suggest that the Government did not try to sell that.  They did not try to put it across.  Perhaps they wanted to and they were conned &mdash;I do not know&mdash;or maybe their heart was not in it.  One thing is certain that anybody who genuinely wants to ensure in this country that there is no corner in the whole 32 counties wherein people who will engage in bombing, knee-capping and all the other appalling atrocities that are going on in this country will get sanctuary&mdash;if that is what the real aim is&mdash;will do his damndest to bring about a common law enforcement area in the whole of the 32 counties and you do not have to prejudice the political position of loyalists in order to do that.</P>

To the delight of at least one person in the House, if not more, I am coming close to the end of my speech.  I want to point out that the concept, not just of an all-Ireland court, but of a common law enforcement area which would not involve the prejudicing of political aspirations by people North or South, but which would, as I said, guarantee to a Protestant in west Cork the same rights as a Catholic in east Belfast, enforced by the same tribunal, with police forces operating to the same standards of control, could be one that would be not only really effective in dealing with the problem with which this Bill purports to deal, but one that would be accepted by people North and South.  Because, as I said earlier, if there is one thing all the people have in common, it is the wish to get these paramilitary self-appointed groups off their backs.  Here is a way that they can really do something effective about it.</P>
      <P>I suggest that it is worth trying and putting it to the people in the North and South to vote on that proposition, because if that is done nobody will have any excuse to get out from under, to say that there is not a mandate there. It is a proposition that could be worth-while if we are trying to do what this Bill purports to do.  Let us not throw it out as being impossible.  We have not tried it.  I agree it is a radical proposal but at this stage, after all this country has gone through and all the people who have been killed and maimed, surely it is worth trying a radical approach, giving people an opportunity to say yes or no to it rather than this Bill which will not work and, even if it did work to a limited extent, will not achieve what can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> I suppose it is politically unreal to appeal to the Government to withdraw this Bill.  I suppose they have committed themselves to the extent that it would not be possible for them to do that.  Nevertheless, I want to suggest that the problem is so grave that unusual and radical approaches are needed.  It would be a radical approach for the Government to say: &ldquo;Right, we will try the other and if it is rejected we will come back and try this method&rdquo;.  But try it because at least if they try it, it will be possible to establish genuinely who are the people in this country who are for and favour the bombers, the maimers and the knee-cappers, and who are against them, because I suggest that if anybody rejects the kind of proposition we have put forward that in shorthand we call an all-Ireland court but which we have tried to spell out in greater detail, at least he or she is clearly demonstrating that he or she would rather have the kind of activities in which the various paramilitary groups have been engaging than that concept.  I have yet to be convinced that the people in the North or in the South would make that choice.  I may be wrong but I think they should be given the chance to make a choice.</P>

      <P>The most insidious aspect of this debate, particularly articulated by Government speakers and more particularly by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and also, of course, evidenced by the Labour Party conference ovation at Dún Laoghaire two weekends ago is that those who oppose this piece of legislation are in some way associated with the men of violence.  Those who make these statements are adding confusion to an already confused and confusing piece of legislation now before the House.  If there is one person who has been consistent on the whole question of violence and the abhorrence of violence by this party it is the Leader of our party, Deputy Lynch.  He has been consistently articulate and he has articulated on many occasions Fianna Fáil's position in relation to violence and the men of violence.  I should have thought those consistent statements quite clearly set <Col N="894" /> out our attitude to violence and its consequences.</P>
      <P>Those who would accuse those who oppose the Bill of being in some way associated with the men of violence also suggest that the Bill itself is the cure-all for violence, North and South.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Fianna Fáil's attitude to violence has been articulated over the years by its leaders and I wish to quote it because Deputy Cruise-O'Brien attacked the recent Fianna Fáil restatement of its position on the North.  It is interesting to note that as far back as 1921 Mr. de Valera wrote to Premier Lloyd George saying:</P>
      <P>As regards the question at issue between the political minority and the great majority of Irish people&mdash; that must remain a question for the Irish people themselves to settle. We cannot admit the right of the British Government to mutilate our country, either in its own interest or at the call of any section of our population; we do not contemplate the use of force.  If your Government stands aside we can effect a complete reconciliation.</P>
      <P>In his speech made in Seanad Éireann in 1939 Mr. de Valera said:</P>
      <P>We came deliberately to the decision that force was not going to be effective and it was not going to be appealed to as a means of solving this particular problem.  Asking them (the British) to use coercion (against Unionists) and asking them not to maintain, by active effort, the present division are quite different things.  I think we could ask them not by any action of theirs to help to perpetuate a division which is dangerous to us and dangerous to them.</P>
      <P>This is an effort, once and for all, to lay the lie that in some way Fianna Fáil in their opposition to this Bill are Provo-liners or Provo-leaners or leaners towards violence generally.  We reject these allegations and my effort here is aimed at indicating to the House these clear statements of Fianna Fáil policy over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in 1949 Mr. de Valera speaking <Col N="895" /> on the Ireland Act of that year said:</P>
    <P>Partition is the result of an action of the British Parliament and Britain should undo it.  Furthermore the British Government should make a declaration to the effect that they want the Partition of the country to end.  Through that Act (1949) they want to pretend that they do not have the responsibility to end partition and to pass it off and to hand over to us the task that they themselves have made practically impossible.</P>
    <P>Another great Leader of this party in 1959, Mr. Lemass at a meeting of the Oxford Union said:</P>
    <P>Our goal is the reunification of Ireland by agreement.  It would be difficult to overstress the magnitude of the improvement that would take place in the whole situation in Ireland if the British Government would now reiterate, in 1959, the hope that was expressed by King George V in 1921 and indicate that they would welcome the advent of the day when the Irish people, North and South, would work together in common love of Ireland upon a foundation of mutual justice and respect.</P>
    <P>To conclude these quotations, in 1971 the then Taoiseach, now Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Lynch speaking at the Garden of Remembrance, stated:</P>
    <P>The Government has stated many times our view that Ireland should be united.  We have made it clear that the unification we seek is one obtained by agreement.  There is no threat in this way to any fair demand of the national minority.  In these circumstances and in the light of the friendly relations which exist between the people of Ireland and Britain we consider it unwise to continue the kind of guarantee to the North which makes intransigence a virtue and silences reason.  It would take nothing away from the honour of Britain or the rights of the majority in the North if the British <Col N="896" /> Government were to declare their interest in encouraging the unity of Ireland by agreement, in independence and in a harmonious relationship between the two islands.</P>
    <P>My reason for placing those quotations on record, as a continuing and consistent statement of Fianna Fáil policy is to show that the Leaders of this great party of ours&mdash;and it is still great despite the wish and the will of those who would like to bury it&mdash;have been consistently opposed to violence. These three Leaders had the support of that party over the years and had the backing of that party for the statements they made at the time they were made. It is, indeed, unfortunate that the suggestion has been made by, as I said, the anti-national Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who is antipathetic to the ideal even of the reunification of this country.  It is also unfortunate that he should introduce into one of the most important debates here in recent years this attempt to suggest this side of the House is in some way associated with the men of violence.  Another insidious innuendo is the argument that those who do not support this Bill are in some way thereby trying to foster the continuation of violence in the North and give succour to those who cowardly flit across the Border to the South.  Nothing could be further from both fact and truth.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has taken upon himself the cloak of law and order.  If one examines the Fianna Fáil record, one finds that Fianna Fáil had to take extremely unpopular action at certain times in its history in order to protect and preserve the institutions of this State.  Fianna Fáil were never wanting in that respect.  We had to take action in the forties, in the fifties, in the sixties and as recently as late 1972. What is most offensive about the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and his pals is the fact that they were literally bombed into voting for the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill at that particular time.  If my memory serves me correctly, I had the honour at the time to be Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and the people who were most <Col N="897" /> vehement then in their denunciation of that Bill stated that, on their return to Government, not thinking for a moment they would return and become the Government some few months later in early 1973, they would repeal the Bill.  Their silence now on this measure is not understandable. One would have thought that those who violently opposed that Bill then, a Bill brought in to deal with a certain situation obtaining in this State&mdash;we had no wish to bring in such a Bill but we saw it as our duty to bring it in&mdash;would be loud in their condemnation now of this measure.  They have their opportunity. They also have the opportunity of repealing the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act and removing it from the Statute Book.  They will do that if they are sincere.  We believe they are not sincere.</P>

      <P>What I was endeavouring to do was expose the insincerity of this Government, the Members of which were in Opposition in 1972.  As I said, Fianna Fáil throughout its history was never wanting in doing its duty in the interests of the democratic institutions of this State.  The attempt by this Government now to don the mantle of law and order is spurious in the context of their then opposition to legislation essential to the preservation of law and order.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into in detail what must be regarded as one of the finest speeches ever made by a Member of this House, namely, the speech by our party Leader on this Bill, but it is important to restate the main grounds of our opposition to this Bill.  There are four grounds.  The first is the unconstitutionality of the Bill.  The Minister said he may&mdash;I am not quite sure about this and I do not want to assign to him words he may not have used&mdash;consider the possibility of sending this Bill elsewhere.</P>

      <P>By introducing this Bill the Government wished to suggest that they are concering the market on law and security and that they alone support the institutions of this State, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Our record is there.  During a certain situation with which this Government were confronted recently Fianna Fáil gave support for their action.  We valued the actions of the Government on that occasion.  We were not slow in coming forward in support of the Government's action.  However, <Col N="902" /> during the years of Fianna Fáil Government we were harried, hounded and had our legislative heels snapped at by the people who are now representing themselves to be the great law and order Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The unconstitutionality of the Bill is well settled.  The Attorney General read a short brief to get on the record of the House that the Bill was constitutional and to refute the arguments of the Opposition in this regard.  That was the extent of his contribution. The second reason why we oppose the Bill is that it would be politically disastrous and it will not help in bringing about peace and reconciliation. By peace I mean that the men of violence who carry out knee-capping, car bombing and murder in the name of Ireland should get off the backs of the people as a matter of urgency.  Those who represent their similarly heinous, foul and cowardly crimes as being done in the name of the link with Britain should also get off the backs of the population.  That would be the prerequisite to peace in the first instance, and then let the democratic process take over.  The corollary to that is reconciliation&mdash;let the politicians from all sides, in the first instance in the North and in the second instance North and South, come together because it is very easy to engage in political shouting matches from a distance but when politicians, we are privileged to be politicians, representatives of the people, can be got together around a table, no matter how at variance their views, and when they begin to recognise each other as human beings with a common concern for the body politic, then progress can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> If these men of violence do not abandon their violent campaign and the pursuit of whatever perverted ideals they are pursuing, if these vicious murders being done in the name of Ireland or in the name of some other cause do not cease, God help us and God save Ireland from the people who would wish to engage in such barbaric practices.</P>
    <P>It is for those reasons that this party believe this is a politically disastrous Bill.  We do not for a moment believe that the Bill will achieve the objective put forward for it: that the violence will end and that this Bill will be a panacea.</P>
    <P>The third main plank in our platform of objection to the Bill is that even if it is constitutionally valid it could bring the whole criminal law into contempt and make a sham of our adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is as well to make it clear that as I understand the proposed law propounded in this Bill, it is the abandonment of the very basic concepts of natural justice, the concept that a person should be heard in his or her own cause and in the presence of his or her own accusers.  It is abandoning the right of every citizen, every accused person, to defend himself in person or through legal assistance and if he cannot pay for that assistance it should be given to him free.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to continue with his interruption because I am anxious to get the Minister's views on this.  Does the Minister say I am wrong?  My authority for the statement I have made is no less than Article 6.3 (c) of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Minister cannot fly in the face of that article or of paragraph (d) of the same article which provides that each accused has the right to examine or have examined for him the witnesses against him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to distinguish between principles and details, and with great respect I suggest I am putting forward very important principles.  Under Article 6 of the Convention on Human Rights an accused person has the absolute right to be present during all proceedings in a criminal trial against him.  To bring the Parliamentary Secretary back to the Bill, under section 11 and section 29 an accused person is given that right as an option but he will be delivered into the custody of the police in Northern Ireland.  That is irrefutable.  It is interesting to note that under Article 5 of the convention an accused person is entitled to a trial within a reasonable time and may be released conditionally under guarantees to appear for trial.  Does the Bill provide for those guarantees? It is very doubtful.  Consequently, we suggest that the criminal law of this country is being brought into contempt, as is also the European Convention on Human Rights.  There is no gainsaying that.  This Bill flies in the face of that convention, files in the face of our criminal law, and, if it flies in the face of those two elements of our democratic State, then it is bad <i>ab initio.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth reason that we suggest the Bill is impure, wrong and unjust is that it compromises our judicial system in the South.  Thankfully, we have a very fine courts system in this part of the country.  Our judges have dispensed justice impartially over the years. Those two elements are an instrinsic part of the judicial system.  We believe this Bill will bring that system into disrepute.  There can be no doubt about that and nobody has suggested otherwise. Indeed, the Minister for Justice himself has not even suggested it.  The minority in the North, since the foundation of that artificial State, have been subjected to a different interpretation of the law from the majority and the police force, the RUC, have been <Col N="906" /> found wanting in the context of impartiality, one citizen as against another.  The courts themselves have been found wanting also&mdash;the law has not been applied so much as misapplied; the colour of one's card determined whether or not one went to jail.</P>
    <P>In my opinion and in that of people far more versed in judicial matters the system which has persisted in the North of Ireland has been a bad one. It did not subscribe to any democratic tenet known to countries that subscribe to such democracy.  What this Bill asks us to do now is to associate ourselves with that system. We believe&mdash;and it has been stated by speakers in this House on a number of occasions&mdash;that the only answer to that problem is the common law enforcement area and an all-Ireland court.  This Bill does not provide for that situation and, because it does not so provide, it is bad.</P>
    <P>We support the objectives of the Bill, the coming to grips with the violent men.  We believe there should be no refuge anywhere in this country for men of violence and that the damage they are doing, in London, any other part of Britain or on this island&mdash;and more particularly in Britain in the context of the harm they are doing to our people living there &mdash;is reprehensible.  We have said on this and many other occasions that there should be no refuge anywhere on this island for such men of violence. We part company on the questions of the operation of this Bill, its constitutionality and the other reasons already stated.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Bill which is of grave concern to us and involves a principle to which we adhere very strongly.  I refer to the rights of the accused person under the European Convention on Human Rights which, again, is not provided for in this Bill.  Under Article 6.1.d. of that convention an accused person has the right to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as have witnesses against him.  There are no provisions in this Bill for that fundamental human right under the convention <Col N="907" /> to which the Governments of this country and of the United Kingdom are signatories.  We believe it is not difficult to foresee the almost impossibility of the accused being able properly and fully to exercise the right guaranteed him under Article 6.1.d. of that convention, having regard to the procedures set out in that article.  Article 14 of that convention states:</P>
    <P>The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the position in the North of Ireland is that there has been naked discrimination in the application of the rule of law as we understand it to be applied down here. Again, this Bill asks us to be associated with that system.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude my contribution by stressing again the total rejection of this party that, because we oppose the Bill, we support the men of violence. That has been given the lie on a number of occasions.  It is important that people who oppose this Bill for the same reasons that we oppose it should continue to say that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> I think it was in the course of the Seanad debate on this Bill it was stated that the approach of those who supported the Bill was that only the men of violence opposed the Bill and there were clearly stated expressions of opinion that only Provo and cryptic or crypto Provo supporters were obstructing the passage of this Bill.</P>
