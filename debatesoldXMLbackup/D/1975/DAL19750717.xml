    <P>SECTION 16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26c:</P>
      <P>In page 18, subsection (2), line 46, after &ldquo;Commisisoners&rdquo; to add &ldquo;within two years from the date of delivery to them of the return on which the assessment is based or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If one considers 26 (c) and 26 (d) together one will see that the object of these amendments is to provide a time limit of two years from the date of a return being made to the Revenue Commissioners within which the Commissioners may review an assessment but that there would be no time limit in the event of fraud or material nondisclosure. Therefore in dealing with genuine cases the taxpayer would be entitled to some degree of certainty as to his liability.  That is the object of these two amendments taken together. I would hope that the Minister would find it possible to agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> Like the Deputy I propose to deal with the two amendments together.  To deal with the first sentence of subsection (2) of section 16, with the addition of the two amendments the subsection will read as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2081" /> An assessment of tax may be reviewed by the Commissioners within two years from the delivery to them of the return on which the assessment is based or at any time in the event of fraud or material non-disclosure in the making of such return.</P>
    <P>This compares with the section as drafted:</P>
    <P>An assessment of tax may be reviewed by the Commissioners at any time.</P>
    <P>In effect, therefore, the purpose of the amendment is to limit the Revenue Commissioners' right to review an assessment to a period within two years of a delivery of a return.  I appreciate the Deputy's reasons for proposing this amendment and in normal circumstances I would go a long way to meet his wishes.</P>
    <P>However the circumstances are not normal.  We are dealing with a new tax and its introduction will present problems for practitioners and the Revenue alike.  This fact has been kept in mind in the structuring of the tax which is designed to take a straightforward and uncomplicated approach to the various problems it presents.  Illustrative of this approach are the following: (1) the intention as far as possible to make an assessment of tax on the basis of the returns as presented by the parties; (2) this necessarily involves that the taxpayer will require to know at some stage later whether his valuations are accepted.  It may be remembered that under section 12 (2) he cannot have a determination of his valuations until after two years from the date of assessment.  However, as I think I indicated on the debate on that subsection it is hoped to reduce this twoyear period later when the initial teething problems of administration have been sorted out; (3) as a corollary, therefore, the Commissioners would be unable to complete the review of all cases within two years of assessment.</P>
    <P>While I understand and appreciate the purpose of the amendment I doubt whether it would be all that beneficial to a taxpayer at this stage of the tax.  If the Commissioners were <Col N="2082" /> to be restricted in time in their review the practical result would be that the initial examination of returns would be more critical and protracted with little over-all saving in time in the long run.  However, I think the question should be reviewed after some experience of the working of the tax to see whether something on the lines of the Deputy's amendment might be done.  In the meantime I would ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment so that administration is not tied to a time limit in the early and difficult years of the tax.  In fact, the matter is academic for another two years even in the terms of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and appreciate the difficulties to which the Minister has referred in the early years of operation of the new tax, with difficulties for the Commissioners, the taxpayers and the practitioners involved.  That is a very valid point.  On the other hand, the Minister has indicated his agreement in principle with the idea of having some time limits or some degree of certainty.  In the circumstances I wonder if, in order to have some degree of certainty, there ought not to be some period put in even if it seems a very lengthy period, but a period which would not place undue strain on the Revenue Commissioners in the manner indicated by the Minister which I accept but at the same time would impose some limitation. There is under the income tax code a limitation of ten years.  It seems excessive to me but nevertheless I would prefer to see some limitation, however long, than as the section stands where there is no limitation and it says &ldquo;at any time&rdquo;.  Would the Minister consider an approach of that kind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Deputy appreciates that it is absolutely academic for two years anyway even in the terms of the Deputy's amendment.  If a person wants to know exactly how he stands in regard to his assessment and his liability he can resort to section 20 which provides for giving receipts and <Col N="2083" /> also a certificate of discharge from wealth tax&mdash;something similar to the old discharge from death duties.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment 26 (d) not moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 26 (e):</P>
      <P>In page 18, subsection (2) (b), line 55, after &ldquo;any&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 16 which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>require any accountable person to deliver to them, within such time...</P>
      <P>I am seeking to insert after &ldquo;any&rdquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;primarily&rsquo; accountable person to deliver to them...&rdquo;.  The reason I put down this amendment is that the requirement of a return from a person who is not primarily liable can produce some pretty ridiculous situations. For instance an estate agent who collects a small rent for a millionaire can be, under the section, required to furnish a return of the total wealth of the millionaire and be subjected to a heavy penalty if he fails to do so.  I know the Minister is likely to say to me that that may be so but that is not the intention, that is not what the Revenue Commissioners will do.  Nevertheless, if it is not the intention, ought we not try to ensure that the legislation does not provide for it?  That is the object of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I consider the amendment unnecessary and I do not propose to accept it.  Where, as a result of a review of an assessment which has been made, an amended assessment is necessary, the Revenue Commissoners may under section 16 (2) (b) apply to any accountable person to deliver an additional return, together with the required particulars to enable them to make an amended assessment. The amendment which seeks to limit the application to any primarily accountable person is not acceptable. To so limit the provision would mean that delivery of an account could not be enforced in certain circumstances if the person primarily accountable were outside the jurisdiction, ill or incapacitated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons secondarily liable for payment of tax&mdash;trustees, agents, and <Col N="2085" /> so on&mdash;would not be liable to deliver additional returns, if the amendment were accepted.  The situation would be incongrous.  A person secondarily liable for the delivery of the first return would not be liable for the delivery of an additional return.  The amendment would be ineffective because the Revenue Commissioners could make an amended assessment themselves on an additional return and apply to a person secondarily liable for payment of the tax.  A position could arise where the original return was delivered not by the person primarily accountable but by a person secondarily liable.  If the amendment were allowed, the additional returns could not be sought from the person who furnished the original return.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will see, therefore, the difficulties which, if the amendment were accepted, would be produced. He speaks about the agent who is collecting a small rent from a millionaire. Of course, he would only be required by the Revenue Commissioners, in practice and in common sense, to furnish such information as he had in relation to the property with which he was dealing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two observations I would like to make on that. First, the position is&mdash;and I think the Minister referred to this&mdash;that the Revenue Commissioners have power to make an estimated assessment, even with no return at all.  Therefore, strictly speaking, they are not limited in the exercise of their powers and responsibilities if they are prevented from making somebody who is secondarily liable furnish a return of this kind.  In practice, the Minister says, they have to confine that to a return of such information as was in possession of the person.  I would expect that is how it would be operated in practice, but that is not what the Bill says.  In view of that being the intention of the Revenue Commissioners, if this amendment is not accepted, ought not there to be a provision which would limit the return and the obligation in regard to a return from a person who is not primarily accountable to such <Col N="2086" /> information as is in his possession or power of procurement?</P>
      <P>I know it would be difficult if such a person did not give information, which he did not have, to make him liable for the penalty that is provided at the end.  It would be difficult but not impossible.  We would not legislate for that kind of situation, as I said earlier, if we can avoid it.  I am suggesting that it is not beyond the ingenuity of the Minister and his advisers to devise a method which will not impose that obligation on somebody who is not primarily accountable and will confine his obligation to such information as he has.  If he must, for the reasons the Minister gives, be obliged to make a return in certain circumstances, should not his obligation be clearly delimited and not leave him in the position of being, at the very least, theoretically liable to a substantial penalty because he does not give the information which he does not have?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> If the Deputy refers to section 14 (5) he will find that the person who is asked for this information is only required to give such information within his possession or power.  It would be absurd to ask an agent here to give information about a principal for whom he was only transacting one item of business in respect of one item of property.  I am sure the Deputy from his experience will know that the Revenue Commissioners have literally volumes of powers at their disposal which run right across the whole field of operations of people, and if they were to use those exhaustive powers against people for whom they were never intended it would be ludicrous.  The Revenue Commissioners are indirectly responsible to this House through the Minister for Finance and the matter would be raised in this House.  If we were to write into a Bill of this nature every protection that could be thought up, it would be so unwieldy as to be just not understandable.  Deputy de Valera is satisfied, I think, generally speaking, that the Revenue Commissioners behave in a reasonable way.  Their business is not to harass people: their <Col N="2087" /> business is to do a job, to collect tax and to get money.  I do not think they harass people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that but, nevertheless, I am not at all happy about a situation in which we give powers which we do not intend to be used and that, in effect, is what the Minister is saying.  It may be true that the Revenue Commissioners have many powers which they do not exercise because to exercise them would be ludicrous, but the suggestion that it is so is often used as a reason for giving additional powers and not going to the trouble of delimiting precisely what powers this House is giving. That is what is sought to be done here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are giving powers in this Bill which both sides of the House agree would be ridiculous to use and it would be contrary to the intention of the House if they were to be used. Yet we are giving the power, because no effort is really being made to delimit that power in the way it is intended to be used.  I do not accept that it is not possible to delimit that power so as to spell out what is intended and what is not intended.  In my view, it is a certain degree of laziness and sloppiness in doing the work that is leading to this situation.  I am blaming everybody concerned on both sides of the House when I say that.  We ought to make a greater effort to spell out precisely, if we are giving powers, what they are and not to say casually: &ldquo;This gives a whole lot of other powers we do not want to give, that it is not intended to exercise, but it is too difficult to spell out.&rdquo; That is a bad approach. We should not acquiesce in that kind of approach.  That is what we are being asked to do in this section.  I am not tying myself to the amendment but to the idea that we <Col N="2088" /> should delimit clearly what we intend to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has correctly described my attitude to the matter.  I wish to come back to something I was adumbrating during the debate for a specific reason: firstly, the question of discretion to the Revenue Commissioners which I am in favour of; secondly, possible constitutional issues.  Because of our Constitution the Revenue Commissioners are more constrained in their discretion that their counterparts on the other side of the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Deputy is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are constantly in the position of having to ask the question: Are we exercising judicial functions?  From my own experience I have no hesitation in giving the Revenue Commissioners all the powers and discretion necessary.  In legislating as we are, we may cause them to multiply their administrative machinery to the extent that the maintenance of the standards we are accustomed to may be difficult.  That is a factor to be taken into account.  This will not be the fault of the Revenue Commissioners or the staff heretofore.  The more an organisation is multiplied&mdash; this legislation will do that&mdash;and made complex, the more difficult it is to retain standards.  That is universal experience.  Couple that with the constitutional position where one has to watch constantly whether a judicial function is being exercised or not.  It is unwise in this legislation to confer what may amount to judicial discretion.  That nets a lot of what has been said on this side of the House with reference to constitutional points.  The Minister asked me last night to come down from the heights in dealing with one matter, but this is something more than the heights.  There is a difficulty here for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been very little acrimony and very few appeals to the court, beyond the normal reaction of people who do not want to pay any tax, about the administration of the taxation <Col N="2089" /> system by the Revenue Commissioners and their officers.  That is an excellent record.  It should not blind us to the fact that if we multiply legislation and administration, the Commissioners will not be able to maintain their standards.  The only difference between Deputy Colley and myself is that while I would agree that the effect is sloppy I do not think that sloppiness is the result of lack of attention to the job or lack of diligence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As I see it, Deputy Colley's concern is to ensure that an agent is not asked to give information which he has not got, and to ensure that an agent is not penalised for not supplying information which is not within his control. That is already covered.  We cannot read section 16 without also reading section 14.</P>
      <P>Section 14 (5) reads:</P>
      <P>An accountable person ... in possession of information relevant to the taxable wealth of an assessable person shall disclose to the Commissioners or such officers as the Commissioners may appoint such information within his possession or power as they may require in writing for the ascertainment of liability to, or the collection of, tax ...</P>
      <P>An agent is only required to furnish information within his possession or power.  If you look at section 16 (1) (b) it can be seen that the draftsman had in mind the provisions of section 14 (5).  Section 16 (1) (b) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>require any accountable person to deliver to them, within such time, not being less than 30 days, as may <Col N="2090" /> be specified in the requirement, an additional return on form provided by the Revenue Commissioners of all the property (or any part thereof) comprised in the taxable wealth of the assessable person...</P>
    <P>Those two sections taken together make it clear that the accountable person will be required only to deal with the wealth of the assessable person about which he has information. That is clear enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest in reference to subsection (5) of section 14 that it may not be as helpful as the Minister thinks.  This amendment deals with the demanding of a further return, not the original return, as is required under section 14.  If that is so and the Minister made that point, I do not think it is open to him to bring section 14 into this.</P>

The provisions of section 16 are standing on their own.  The only indication of what the Minister has in mind is the words in brackets &ldquo;or any part thereof&rdquo;.  That could be stretched to mean that that is all the Revenue <Col N="2091" /> Commissioners will seek.

I do not want to go back over what we did but we had a fairly detailed discussion last night on another aspect where I contended that it was not clear and the <Col N="2092" /> Minister is to look into the situation. These are not isolated instances.

What guarantee have we got that the brief of the parliamentary draftsman&mdash;by that phrase I mean a number of people over a number of years, I am not referring to a particular man&mdash;includes the protection of the rights of individual?  Is it not a fact that his brief is to translate into legal terms the heads of a Bill as approved by the Government?  If we are to approach it on the basis of &ldquo;leave it to the expert&rdquo; we are simply abdicating our responsibilities in this House.  I do not accept that we should approach it in that way.  I am not going to continue to discuss this matter <i>ad nauseam</i>.  We are working under a time limit and I have made my position clear on this.  I just want to reiterate that the attitude I am taking in this is not one that I am adopting only in Opposition.  I took exactly the same view on the other side of the House, though it is more difficult to do on the other side of the House.

      <P>Perhaps I could put another point to the Minister.  I have seen this phrase interpreted in a way <Col N="2097" /> that I think is stretching much too far although the interpretation does seem to favour the goodwill of the Revenue Commissioners.  I think it is stretching it and it is this, in a later section there is a provision that you cannot appeal without paying 75 per cent of the assessment and the interpretation I saw on this was that the purpose of saying &ldquo;withdraw&rdquo; here was to enable the Revenue Commissioners in certain circumstances to withdraw the assessment and thereby enable a person to appeal without having to pay 75 per cent.  I think that is interpreting it in a very extreme way.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> There is nothing involved here.  The Commissioners may withdraw the assessment and raise another one. They are obliged to do it but I think it is in the interests of promoting the best relationships possible between the taxpayer or his advisers and the Revenue Commissioners.  People do not like to have <i>ad hoc</i> assessments raised without any return being made and if a man gets such an assessment he runs to his adviser with it and the adviser says &ldquo;That is all right.  I will get in touch with them&rdquo; and he is able to tell him then that that assessment will be withdrawn and that he will put in a return for him if he gives him the necessary information and it runs along more smoothly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 20, to delete subsection (3) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest shall not be payable upon tax which is paid within three months of the valuation date upon which it becomes due and payable and, where tax and interest thereon (if any) are paid within 30 days of the date of the assessment thereof, interest shall not run for the period from the date of the assessment to the date of payment:</P>
      <P>Provided that interest shall not be payable upon tax which is paid before the 5th day of October, 1975.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2099" /> The main purpose of this amendment is to extend the interest-free period for this year in view of the fact that this is the introductory year of the tax.  This is done by the addition of a proviso to the original subsection (3).  The subsection itself is being slightly amended to make the position more clear where tax is paid within 30 days of the date of assessment.  As the House knows, the valuation date in this year is 5th April, 1975, but due to difficulty in processing this legislation through the House, this amendment is brought in to provide that the interest will not be payable on tax which is paid on or before 5th October, 1975, and we availed of the introduction of the amendment to make it clear that interest will not be payable for the period beginning on the date of the assessment and ending 30 days after that.</P>
    <P>In the House last night when dealing with another amendment on another section which was in some way related to this topic, it was suggested that an extension of the interest-free period in this year should be extended beyond 5 October, 1975. The suggestion was made that it should be extended for a period of three months but Deputy de Valera did say&mdash;I think I could paraphrase him in this way&mdash;that if there were difficulties in extending the period to three months, some extension should be considered and given.  I have considered the matter since then and I feel that if I were to extend this interest-free period for three months beyond 5th October, 1975, I would be coming very close to the valuation date for 1976 and would be likely to create chaos in the Revenue Commissioners' office.</P>
    <P>However, as I said, this Bill will be through the Oireachtas shortly and I understand that most of the people, if not all of them, who will be concerned with the Bill are people who are likely to be represented by professional consultants and that most of these professional people are already preparing to make returns.  It will be open to anybody to make returns as soon as the Bill becomes law and, of <Col N="2100" /> course, they can make a payment on account if they like.  Having said all that, I am prepared to extend the interest-free period beyond 5th October, 1975, and I am prepared to go as far as 5th December, 1975.  That is a genuine effort to meet the wishes of the House and of the people.  The amendment would then read as it stands with &ldquo;5th December&rdquo; being inserted in the last line for &ldquo;5th October&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly would agree with that amendment of the amendment.  It is a distinct improvement on the position that was being presented under the amendment as tabled.  For that we would like to express our appreciation.  Nevertheless, the whole position arising here is totally unsatisfactory and that there is a patching-up effort having to go on in order to get some degree of reasonableness, and I say only some degree, into the situation.  As the amendment was tabled it was designed to deal with the situation as it arises but the position is that this Bill is likely to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas about 20th August and if one took the date in the amendment as tabled, 5th October, that would have left about one and a half months in which to peruse the final form of the Bill, to assess oneself correctly and to pay tax.  Otherwise, one would have been liable to interest and that interest would be at 18 per cent per annum from 5 April to the 5th of the month following payment.  I would regard that as a most iniquitous and penal provision.  What the Minister has announced is a considerable improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that all of this tinkering with the dates for 1975 arises, not because, as is sought to be suggested from the Government benches, of filibustering or unreasonable opposition on this side of the House.  I would venture to suggest that the Opposition's performance on this and on the other capital taxation measures will be shown from the record to have been detailed and conscientious effort on the part of the Opposition to deal <Col N="2101" /> with what are very difficult and complex Bills.  The real problem arises because of two things: one, that the Government were very dilatory in bringing forward the Bills.  They should have been produced much earlier than they were.  I do not think that the Minister can contest that statement.</P>
    <P>If some kind of charge analagous to the 18 per cent interest rate were to be imposed on Members of the Government in respect of their dilatoriness in this matter, they might take a different view of the situation and their approach would be more equitable than it was in the amendment as tabled.</P>
    <P>The other matter that causes the difficulty is one to which I referred last night, that is the fact that the White Paper said that the commencement date for the wealth tax would be 6th April, 1975.  It also said that the wealth tax would be charged on one particular day in each year, probably, it said, 5th April, which is the last day of the tax year.  It did not commit the Government to 5th April as the valuation date but it said it was likely.  But it did say specifically that the commencement date for the wealth tax was 6th April.  The clear implication of that was that what the Government intended to do was to charge an annual wealth tax but, for technical reasons which were spelled out in the White Paper, it would have to be based on wealth on a particular day, that the valuation date likely to be chosen for that was 5th April in each year and that consequently what was intended was that wealth tax considered as an annual tax would commence on 6th April, 1975 and that the first valuation date would be 5th April, 1976.</P>
    <P>If that had been adhered to we would not have the kind of problems we are faced with in this amendment and now the amendment to the amendment given by the Minister, because there would have been adequate time to process this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas, to give taxpayers and their advisers a reasonable opportunity to consider the implications, to make preparations, to get valuations where they were necessary, <Col N="2102" /> and to operate the wealth tax in an orderly way.</P>
    <P>I believe the plans as outlined in the White Paper would have ensured that but, for some reason&mdash;one can speculate on the reason; I have a fairly good theory as to why this was changed but that is irrelevant&mdash;the Government changed their minds and departed from what was said in the White Paper and, instead of doing what was proposed in the White Paper, which was to have the wealth tax commence on 6th April, 1975, and to have the first valuation date 5th of April, 1976, they departed from that and tried to rush it through a year earlier.  This led to all of the difficulties we have been faced with, long sittings, amendments and amendments to amendments.  All of this gets back to the departure from what was clearly set out in the White Paper.  As I say one can speculate on the reasons, but that may not be relevant here.</P>
    <P>The fact is that all of these difficulties have arisen and they have arisen not, I repeat, because of unreasonable Opposition in this House, but because of two things, both attributable to the Government.  One, the failure to bring forward the legislation, to publish the legislation in reasonable time and, two, the departure from what the White Paper said was going to be the programme for implementation of the wealth tax.  All of that has led to all the difficulties we have had with this Bill: the long sittings and the amendments which have had to be put in and now the Minister has had to amend the amendment again.  It is unfortunate that it should be so, but if it is so let it be clear why it is so.  I do not think that it is open to the Minister to contend, as he tried to contend last night, that the Government did not say in the White Paper, and make it quite clear, that what they intended was to have as the first valuation date for wealth tax purposes 5th April, 1976, although the Bill now says 5th April, 1975.  Just to refresh the Minister's memory on this, let me remind him that paragraph 93 of the White Paper said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2103" /> The wealth of the taxpayer would be valued on, say, the last day of the tax year, at present the 5th April.</P>
    <P>On page 60 of the White Paper it is stated:</P>
    <P>Annual wealth tax: The date of commencement will be 6 April, 1975.</P>
    <P>There is, I suggest, a significance in the fact that it says 6th April and not 5th April.  Any reasonable reading of this White Paper&mdash;and I can confirm that this is how it was read by numerous people&mdash;shows that the commencement date would be 6th April and the first valuation date would be 5th April.  If that reading is not correct, the only other possible explanation is that the Government are charging wealth tax in advance.  If it is to commence on 6th April and the first payment date is 5th April then it is being charged in advance.  The Minister denied strenuously last night that it was being charged in advance.</P>
    <P>If it is not, the only other possible reading of the White Paper is the one I have put forward and the one that I am quite sure is what the Government intended, which was to have as the first valuation date 5th April, 1976, and that would have allowed for a reasonable processing of the Bill and implementation of all the necessary measures both on the part of the Revenue Commissioners and on the part of taxpayers to operate this measure smoothly.  Instead of that, for whatever reason, we have had the very unsatisfactory manner in which this Bill has had to be dealt with in this House.  Now we are operating under a guillotine because of the failure of the Government, on the one hand, to bring forward the Bill in adequate time and, on the other hand, the failure of the Government to adhere to what they stated in the White Paper as the programme for implementation.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Government published their White Paper on Capital Taxation in February, 1974.  This Bill was presented to this House on 13th of <Col N="2104" /> February of this year.  It got a Second Reading on 12th March, 1975.  One could have understood a good rousing political debate on the Second Reading. We had it, but the House accepted the principle of the Bill.  Deputy Colley made the point, last night and again today, that there is some going back on the White Paper about the date of introduction of the tax.  One thing which is clear in the White Paper is that wealth tax was to commence in April, 1975.  The Bill implements that.</P>
      <P>Since this Bill was published the Minister for Finance and his officials met many professional bodies and discussed the Bill with them.  The point raised by Deputy Colley in regard to the commencement of it in relation to the White Paper never was raised.  It never was raised until Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, my namesake, raised it here in this House.  He was perfectly entitled to do that and I am not complaining.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This amendment has been brought in because of the difficulty in getting this Bill through the House.  It was introduced on 13th February and got a Second Reading on 12th March.  It has been obstructed here in a most unreasonable way since.  The amendment I am introducing now first of all proposed to extend the time to 5th October but, in the course of discussions that we had here in a reasonable way, I thought the reasonable thing was to go as far as 5th December.  I have gone that far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley blames the Government for not processing the Bill <Col N="2105" /> earlier, for not having it through the House, and for now introducing the guillotine.  I am afraid that the Opposition used the Committee Stage of the Bill not to improve it, not to do Committee Stage work, but to try and exploit it for political purposes.  For example we had, approximately, a 20-hour debate on section 2 of this Bill to which there was no amendment and which was a complete and utter waste of time.  It may be said: why did not we put on the guillotine?</P>

I would have been accused of depriving the Opposition of their rights.  I do not want to take up what time is left but, in view of the fact that Deputy Colley said the Opposition were conscientiously and scrupulously going through this Bill on Committee Stage, I want to say to the Opposition that they are behaving in a disgraceful manner even at this stage. It is now mid-day and the debate must conclude on Committee Stage at 2.15 p.m.  We have yet to deal with the charging of tax on property, receipts and discharges, appeals and penalties.  The Opposition are using their time in such a way that it will not be possible to do that.</P>
      <P>I want to put the blame for the failure to deal with this Bill, section by section, fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Opposition, even since the guillotine went down. Yesterday evening we had Deputy Colley bringing into this House, and encouraging, Members of the Opposition to contribute.  He was perfectly entitled to do it, but I respectfully say they had very little to contribute to the Committee Stage of this Bill. If Deputy Colley wanted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to waste time unduly on this matter but it is important that we get the facts right. What was the Minister's answer to the major fact with which he was faced, which is the departure from the provisions of the White Paper, as a result of which wealth tax is being introduced one year earlier than was said in the White Paper?  The White Paper said the wealth tax was to commence in April, 1975.  That was his answer.  A nice glossed over answer.  The White Paper said the wealth tax was to commence on 6th April, 1975, not 5th April.</P>
      <P>There is a significance in that date because it had previously referred to the valuation date being 5th April, the last day of the tax year.  No amount of glossing over this and saying one day does not make a difference, or mentioning the month of April, will overcome the fact that the White Paper said specifically the date of commencement was 6th April.  Any amount of attempted abuse of the Opposition by the Minister does not explain away the reason for the Government departing from this, and introducing the wealth tax a year earlier than they said they would, and thereby imposing enormous difficulties and strain on this House, on the other House, and on everybody who will be concerned with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the conduct of the Opposition on Committee Stage, I want to say in regard to section 2, which is the charging section, Deputies spoke within the rules of order from this side of the House on that charging section, and expressed on behalf of this party the grave concern of this party at the economic consequences of introducing the wealth tax, something they were <Col N="2107" /> not only entitled to do, but obliged to do.  The Government imposed a guillotine on section 2.  If the Minister is attempting to say that the conduct of this side of the House in regard to the remaining sections was, I think he used the word, &ldquo;disgraceful&rdquo; then I can only say that the Minister will have to be judged by his use of that word in the light of the record of this House.</P>

      <P>Whether the Minister wants to say irresponsible or disgraceful the fact is his use of that word, and the mentality it discloses, will be judged in the light of the record of this House, specifically in regard to last night when the Minister stated I encouraged Deputies on this side to speak when they had virtually nothing to say.  I think I am paraphrasing the Minister fairly when I say that.  Let me say, No. 1, I did not encourage anybody to speak and, No. 2, those who did speak had things to say of considerable importance.  In particular, one Deputy dealt with a very practical difficulty, a difficulty about which Deputies behind the Minister were very concerned too, in case he does not know it, and the Minister gave no satisfaction in response. However, it is not just the right of Deputies&mdash;of course the Minister concedes the right of Deputies to speak in this House on Committee Stage or otherwise&mdash;but it is the duty of the Opposition to do the kind of work on a Bill of this type that we have been doing.  The difficulty for the Minister and the Government is that they were years in Opposition and they never did this kind of work.  They did not do their job in Opposition.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 28a:</P>
      <P>In page 20, lines 35 to 37, to delete subsection (4) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) A payment on account of tax shall be applied&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if there is interest due on tax at the date of the payment, to the discharge, so far as may be, of the interest so due; and</P>
      <P>(b)  if there is any balance of that payment remaining, to the discharge of so much tax as is equal to that balance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is being made to improve the original drafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 18 of the Bill the tax becomes due on the valuation date.  Interest on tax is payable from that date unless the tax is paid within three months of that date.  A payment may be made at any time after a valuation date on account of tax due on that date.  This provides the taxpayer <Col N="2109" /> with the means of stopping interest running in a case where he is not in a position to furnish a return within three months of the valuation date.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that, when a payment is made on account of tax, the payment must be set off, in the first instance, against any interest which has accrued and the balance must then be applied in discharge of the tax itself.  The subsection as drafted in the Bill states:</P>
    <P>A payment on account of tax shall, in the first instance, be applied in discharge of interest, if any, outstanding on tax and thereafter, in discharge of tax.</P>
    <P>It might be argued that through the use of a word &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; a small payment on account would result in the satisfaction of a larger amount of interest or tax.  For example, a payment of £100 on account would, on a technicality, discharge the liability of £800.  That might be argued.  The amendment is intended to spell out more clearly the application of a payment on account.  Under the subsection as redrafted the payment on account must be applied, firstly, in discharge of interest so far as may be and if there is a balance of payment on account after the satisfaction of the interest, towards the discharge of tax to the extent of such balance. Taking subsection (4) in conjunction with subsection (5) the overall position must be that a payment on account must, in the first instance, exhaust interest on tax and the balance of the payment on account must be applied <i>pro tanto</i> in satisfaction of tax due.</P>

      <P>I have a certain uneasiness about this section.  The charging of interest is understandable, necessary, and even desirable subject to the rate.  I say that subject to the two reservations we have had through the debate, the rate and the fact that interest is one-sided; that interest will be taken by the Revenue Commissioners but will not be granted in corresponding cases in reverse.  As in the income tax code the payment of interest is understandable and justifiable but under the provisions of the Bill a person is required to assess himself in a new situation. There is the continuing difficulty that that assessment may be innocently erroneous.  Because of such a situation there may be an accumulation of interest which the person liable did not expect.  In the innocent case I am contemplating the person had no reason to expect this.</P>
      <P>I do not see anything in this section which gives a discretion to the Revenue Commissioners to deal with a case like that.  It becomes due and payable yes, but whether a discretion is involved or not I cannot say.  This difficulty is not likely to arise with income tax because assessment to income tax is a well established procedure. It is an annual matter of a different nature and it does not extend to property the way capital tax does.  There is inherent in this the possibility of serious injustice, analogous to the type of injustice that occurred under the estate duty code. The generous thresholds applied go a long way to adjust the situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably say that anybody will get professional advice and that, in theory, may be all right and that is what I characterise generally as administrative or staff thinking. In practice it may not work out that way and there may be reasons why not.  I do not know what the answer is, but it is an uneasiness I have about the section.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 6 states:</P>
      <P>All sums due under the provisions of this Act shall be paid to the Accountant-General, Revenue Commissioners, Dublin 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2111" /> Very often cheques are paid to the &ldquo;Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;  The statute says to the &ldquo;Accountant-General, Revenue Commissioners. Dublin 2.&rdquo;  Would there be a technical defect in a cheque addressd to the &ldquo;Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;?  Could a point be made of that?  It is a ridiculously small point, but this is a statute.  Would it not be better to have it paid to the Revenue Commissioners than to specify the officer of the Revenue Commissioners?  The Commissioners could then accept it through any officer.  To give an example of what may happen: Somebody could be dilatory and it could get into the hands of the solicitor for the Revenue Commissioners.  It could be a case of somebody not catching up on their job.  They get a letter from the Revenue Commissioner's solicitor requesting payment and the requisite charge of interest.  The recipient of the letter realises that not only was all the fairness on the side of the Revenue Commissioners but that the Revenue Commissioners' solicitor had gone to the trouble of writing most courteously about it and a cheque is sent by return.  It could be made payable to the solicitor but that would be a technical noncompliance with the provisions of the Act.  Why not say, &ldquo;Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is accepted that it must be charged because otherwise there would be an encouragement not to make returns and to avail of the money.  I cannot see any other way of doing it.  The sums due are directed to be paid to the Accountant-General, as distinct from the Collector General.  The Collector General deals with income tax and VAT.  This is a capital tax and it is therefore directed to be paid to the Accountant General to distinguish it from the other and to get it into the proper Vote.  I do not think Deputy de Valera need have any trouble about the case he cites&mdash;the cheque being sent to the solicitor. Surely, if the solicitor is doing his business he will direct it to the right channel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy de Valera, I consider the interest rate of 18 per cent per annum charged here far too high.  The only reason we have not got an amendment down to reduce this figure is because we have sought by amendment to reduce this figure in a number of pieces of legislation brought forward by the Minister for Finance and on each occasion it has been voted down.  The figure is ridiculously high, and that is highlighted when we come to the question of re-payments. One finds that the Minister for Finance is very reluctant to provide anywhere that the Revenue Commissioners will pay interest on repayments. It is done in a few limited cases but where it clearly should be done he refuses to do it for a good reason; it would be open to a taxpayer deliberately to overpay substantially and earn himself 18 per cent interest on the money.  That, of course, is not a desirable thing, but it highlights the degree to which the rate of interest being charged is too high.</P>
      <P>I also want to question why this section should provide that interest is payable from the valuation date as distinct from a reasonable period following the date of an assessment.  In theory the citizen is supposed to assess himself on 5th April and therefore if he does not pay on that day, he is liable for interest.</P>

Is that right?</P>

      <P>I had not finished when the Minister interrupted me.  I will say it again for him.  There is a 30day interest-free period from the date of assessment if the payment is made within that 30 days, but at the same time interest is charged for the previous period from 5th April to the date of assessment if that is later than 5th July.  What is the logic behind this approach?  It seems a new and unjustifiable principle to charge interest on tax that is not yet assessed, and that is what is being done here.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the point raised by Deputy de Valera on reassessment.  An area where this could easily occur is where there is a valuation of shares in a private company, an area which is fraught with difficulty.  It could easily happen that a taxpayer, acting absolutely <i>bona fide,</i> could submit a return in connection with such shares, placing particular value on them and, years later, the Revenue Commissioners could say they did not agree with that and charge interest over a period of years on the amount extra they found to be due.  As we saw on an earlier section, there is no limitation whatever, at the moment, on the number of years they can go back.  This raises a serious problem and there does not seem to be any provision in this section to give any degree of reasonable protection to a taxpayer in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>The primary question I want the Minister to answer is, what is the logic behind what appears to be a new and unjustifiable principle whereby a taxpayer is liable to interest on tax which has not yet been assessed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is necessary, in regard to the amount or rate of interest, to have the rate of interest at least as high as that chargeable elsewhere.  As a matter of fact, it is necessary to go a little further and introduce a penal element into it in order to encourage, or pressurise, people <Col N="2114" /> into paying their wealth tax in time. Otherwise it would be good economics for them to delay the payment of wealth tax and use the money for other purposes.  They could invest it and drag on and on at a low rate of interest.  Deputy Colley as Minister for Finance a few years ago recognised this.  For years, the rate of interest payable on death duties was something like 4 per cent and he increased it to 9 per cent, which was above the going rate at that time.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Minister for a moment on that point? I was at the same time anxious to establish the principle that on overpayments there should be a repayment at the same rate.  The level of interest being charged here makes it difficult for the Minister for Finance to agree to these.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am agreeing and we will deal with that, if the Deputy lets us get to it. The proposal here is that the valuation date be 5th April and if wealth tax is paid within three months of that date there is no interest payable.  Admittedly, if it is not paid for six months there is interest then payable from 5th April but there is a pause for the assessment date for 30 days.  If a person is not assessed for six months or does not pay there is interest payable for six months but he has then a further month in which there will be no interest payable.

One of the questions I asked him was: Why not commence the interest liability from a reasonable period after the assessment date?  What is proposed here is 30 days.  Why not provide that if the payment is not made within 30 days of assessment interest would then commence to run, but what is provided is that during that 30 days there will be no interest but that for the previous period of possibly six months there will be interest.</P>

Does the Minister appreciate that shares in a private company can present difficulties in valuation and arguments as to what their real value is.  Let us assume that a taxpayer has, in his taxable wealth, shares in a private company and he makes a genuine effort to value them and he pays tax on that basis.  Years later, as the Bill stands without limitation on the number of years, the Revenue Commissioners could decide that that valuation was not correct and that it should be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear under this section that if they do that the taxpayer would be liable for interest for the length of period whatever it was&mdash; eight years, ten years or whatever&mdash;<Col N="2117" /> that the Revenue Commissioners decided to review it and change the figure.  Would the Minister not agree that in circumstances of that kind it is unfair to charge the taxpayer interest at 18 per cent on whatever would be the extra sum for a period of ten or more years?  Should not some provision be made to ease the imposition of the interest in circumstances of that kind?</P>

The Deputy knows that there is provision in the Bill for agreeing values for a three-year period.  Once the Revenue Commissioners and the taxpayer agree on a figure, that figure is valid, apart from certain exceptions, for a further two years.  I am convinced that if we were to say that in the case of a person who genuinely makes an effort to value his shares or his property, that if it turns out afterwards that he was grossly under-valued, he would not be liable to tax, that would only be inviting people to avail of that amendment&mdash;to say afterwards that there was an innocent misrepresentation or an innocent error but that they did their best.</P>

It is not easy to determine the real value of a lot of things at the moment.  I know things that were worth £200,000 some years ago but which cannot be sold today.  Valuation at present is not easy to assess.  Would it be reasonable if a person or accountants put in a valuation and that if it emerges a couple of years later that that valuation was significantly greater, is it reasonable to charge interest?

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 19.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 19 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, in view of the definition of &ldquo;real property&rdquo; under section 1, one can take it that the reference to real property in subsection (2) of this section includes leaseholds and land vested by the Land Commission and registered in the Land Registry.  Therefore, it seems to me that very grave difficulties may occur under this section in many ordinary transactions.  It should be remembered that we are dealing here with an annual tax, not like death duties where there was a somewhat similar provision for a certificate of discharge from death duties.  Under this, one will need a certificate in respect of each valuation date for 12 years, not just the one certificate as was necessary in the case of death duties.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that there is no good case for making property subject to a charge for wealth tax in the hands of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value whatever the consideration.  This section proposes to make it subject to a charge even in the hands of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value if the consideration exceeds £50,000.  I would also suggest that subsection (3) may well be unworkable in many cases because it is possible that in a number of cases a purchaser will find it impossible to ascertain with certainty whether his vendor had other previous transactions within the previous two years with his vendor, in other words, the vendor in the transaction with which we are concerned.  The purchaser has to ascertain this with certainty or he can be in considerable difficulty.  That is why subsection (3) may turn out to be unworkable in a number of cases. In the light of these objections, unless the Minister can throw some light on them that does not appear from reading the section, I am afraid the provisions of this section, although I understand why they are there, are going to present considerable difficulties, as I said at the outset, in many ordinary transactions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This is a charging section.  Section 19 (1) charges all real property comprising taxable wealth of a person and also charges all personal property, but <Col N="2123" /> in regard to personal property there is only a charge on it as long as it is in the possession and ownership of the assessable person.  Subsection (2) deals with real property, and it provides that real property comprising taxable wealth of an assessable person shall not, as against a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for full consideration, remain charged after 12 years.  There is a precedent for that in the present death duty code.  Subsection (3) releases what I will call small transactions, and indeed according to any standards they are not small.  Real property which changes hands for less than £50,000 is discharged from wealth tax in the hands of the purchaser unless there are other transactions between the purchaser and the same vendor.  I do not think it goes back any further between the purchaser with whom we are dealing and the same vendor within two years.</P>
      <P>I have been thinking about subsection (2) which discharges real property in the hands of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value after 12 years.  We obviously took 12 years from the estate duty code.  I think we could reduce that a bit.  With the permission of the House I propose to reduce &ldquo;12 years&rdquo; in the second last line of subsection (2) to six years.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Colley asked me whether I was giving sufficient weight to the fact that this was an annual tax as distinct from a now-and-again tax. <Col N="2125" /> I feel that I am.  First of all in so far as personal property is concerned there is no problem once it leaves the hands of the taxpayer.  All real property stands discharged after six years in the hands of the purchaser. Property which changes hands for £50,000 or less stands discharged immediately unless there were other transactions between the purchaser of that property and the same vendor. There is provision, in reply to Deputy Enright's query, for a certificate of discharge from wealth tax and that certificate of discharge will take much the same form as a certificate of discharge on death duties.  In other words, it will certify that up to the date specified in the certificate there is no charge for wealth tax against the property concerned.  Of course on exempted property, like a private residence, if there is a certificate, the question of wealth tax will not arise. I do not think there is anything to worry about.  It would be unreasonable not to charge real property to the extent that it is charged in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an assessment for each of six years instead of one assessment.  This is what the Minister was replying to. There is obviously an administrative difficulty here.  It is six times the job for the Revenue Commissioners to prepare the certificate.  I do not want to anticipate the argument on section 20.  What I would be concerned about here is the physical capacity of the Revenue Commissioners to clear the mechanics of this charging section in time and the consequences of it not being done in time may lead to the difficulties that Deputy Colley mentioned and may further lead to considerable commercial embarrassment. When I say commercial embarrassment I mean embarrassment that will not be good for the community in the effecting of certain transactions.  There are really six assessments involved.  This is not a simple operation for the Revenue Commissioners and they cannot be expected to give a certificate in the same time.  In the case of death duties there was a provisional <Col N="2126" /> assessment.  Obviously that procedure is not applicable here.</P>

      <P>Yes, if he does not get the certificate of discharge.  Could I interrupt the Minister for a moment and add to what Deputy de Valera said?  From the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners it is not just six assessments.  They have got to look, not just at the property, but at different persons.  The property could have been in the ownership of different persons and the job involved is going to be pretty substantial.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> These will be transactions of over £50,000.  If the vendor is a wealth tax payer the Revenue Commissioners will have a file on him from the introduction of the tax or from the day he came into the net.  There is no problem there at all.  If he is not a wealth tax payer it will be necessary to make some enquiries just as at the present time if a property is changing hands and the estate duty has not been finally settled, it is necessary to make enquiries and if necessary furnish a corrective affidavit.  We are dealing here with transactions over £50,000. If the person is already paying wealth tax there is no problem.  If he is not it will be necessary to make some enquiries.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with a vendor-purchaser situation, as I understand it.  Deputies will recollect the old section 6 certificate and that very often goes back over the years. Up to 1st April this year we have had this business of where there have not been what I call full commercial transactions, where there has been a voluntary element in transactions&mdash; quite a common thing in dealing with property and development&mdash;and you had a future liability for succession duties arising where you had to have it commuted.

I wanted to come back again to the point I raised with regard to the purchaser and the obligation imposed on him.  I do not think the Minister quite got the point I was putting.  If we assume for a moment that I was purchasing property from the Minister for a consideration less than £50,000 and that the Minister had acquired that property, say, from Deputy Esmonde, I would have to establish that during the two years prior to the sale there had been no other transaction between the Minister and Deputy Esmonde, because if <Col N="2128" /> there had been, it could produce the question was the property charged. At least that is how I read the section. If it is so, this could present in practice impossible difficulties to ascertain with certainty what the position was.</P>

      <P>I think I know what Deputy Colley is getting at.  If a person has quite a substantial number of holdings the problem arises of consolidating or separating them.  It can reach the situation in which, take two holdings of say, £45,000 each: if Deputy Colley is selling and I buy one portion and I put the other portion in my wife's name, are we both exempt?  There is one vendor but two separate parties purchasing who, for taxation purposes, may be considered as one person.  Is that sufficient to escape the net?  I can see a situation arising where a person who wants to avoid wealth tax in disposing of property can do so if he is lucky enough to find two or three separate purchasers.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Putting into his wife's name would not alter the position but to get back to the point made: Deputy Colley purchases from me for less than £50,000. Deputy Colley is concerned only with transactions between himself and myself within two years.  If I bought from Deputy Esmonde, it is a matter between myself and Deputy Esmonde. I might still be liable for wealth tax on this property, but it is not charged on the property, in my opinion.  This section discharges it in the hands of a purchaser for less than £50,000 unless there were other transactions as set out in the section between that purchaser and me.</P>

Could I ask the Minister between now and Report Stage to go into that even further, because it is very important that that <Col N="2130" /> should be so.  Could I ask him further if, in fact, it turns out not to be so, would he reconsider the whole concept of charging real property with liability for wealth tax, because it seems to be if that is one of the consequences and if you take into account what Deputy Enright was talking about and the possibilities of evasion which he outlined, the only way you can close that in the lines of this section is to interpret it the way I am interpreting it; in other words if in fact there has been this kind of attempted evasion that he outlined, the effect of subsection (3) should be to aggregate these things and therefore charge the property with the wealth tax.  If that happens, then the purchaser for value is affected, and if there is any danger of this complication setting in, it would be better to drop the whole idea of charging real property in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>All property is chargeable but real property is charged in the hands of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value, whereas you do not pursue personal property.  The question I want to ask the Minister is this: is the simple reason for that not that you can get your hands fairly surely on the real property and you cannot on the other?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a sufficient reason for charging real property in this case?  It is different to other cases, and I will tell you why. I think the question has more relevance here than in the case of other property.  In the case of the big transaction that the Minister is considering, where considerable sums in wealth tax may attach, it is likely that the property concerned may be more in the nature of personal property than realty.  It can be in the form of shares, for instance.  I am not going to delay the House with giving specific examples.  I think it will be enough to give the hint for the Minister's consideration.  It is quite conceivable that the transactions that would be significant for wealth tax purposes as distinct from the traditional situation in regard to estate duty where, coming from the days of the landed estate, the important thing was real property&mdash;in the case of wealth tax it is quite possible, if not even proper, that the bulk of the taxable property will not be realty as such.  Therefore the only reason it is being charged is that the Revenue can get their hands on it and they can get a security that they cannot get in the other case.</P>
      <P>Therefore I would reinforce what Deputy Colley has said on an examination of the subject, that if difficulties of that nature and others accumulate, it might be more prudent, realistic and certainly administratively more convenient for the Revenue Commissioners, having regard to section 20, to forego what is really what one might call a security for payment provision in this case.  I do not expect an answer to that, because I simply say it as something for the Minister to consider.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I would like to put this on the record. There is more in the section than appears to Deputy de Valera.  In order for any tax to be fair and just and equitable it must be collected from all people who are liable to it.  This is not always 100 per cent possible, but <Col N="2132" /> certainly in order that a tax may be equitable and just the Revenue Commissioners should take reasonable steps to collect it from those liable to it.</P>
      <P>Experience has shown that the certificate of discharge is one of the methods or part of the machinery through which a lot of taxable property comes to light.  This certificate of discharge in these big cases may very well have the effect of bringing people who are liable to wealth tax into the net who otherwise would succeed in staying out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what has to be said on section 20 has already been said on section 19.  I would simply confine myself to saying that it is going to be more difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to process certificates of discharge and to give them with the expedition required in the cases under this Act than it has been in the case of estate duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading debate on the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill a number of us pointed out that the Estate Duty Office had got into a very serious jam, and that it was very hard to get even provisional assessments, much less certificates of discharge. These are facts.  I was challenged on that and I mentioned&mdash;I think it is on the record&mdash;that I made a number of individual inquiries at certain solicitors' offices and even got <Col N="2133" /> authority to disclose the cases, if necessary.  In every case, however, it was genuinely qualified by the statement that nothing but the most helpful co-operation had been given as far as possible by what was described as the harassed officers of the sections concerned.  It was even said in one case that people were being driven to the point of almost nervous breakdown by the burden of work in these Departments.  It is with that in mind and the discussion on the previous section, without repeating what I said, I wonder whether this section is not in the initial stages going to result in some serious log jams.  I am conceding the Minister's point&mdash;and he does not need to repeat it&mdash;about the value for collective purposes of issuing certificates, and as far as he went with that it is a valid argument and of great assistance to the administration of the code.  On the other hand there is the physical problem of dealing with the work involved. I have no idea what volume is going to be concerned but even though there may not be many people concerned, there will be initially a considerable amount of exploratory work to be done as well as routine work.  In these circumstances, I would simply ask the Minister to consider the short-term consequences of this section and whether he should not have some transitory provisions in that regard.</P>

      <P>No, it is not the fault of the office, but what it is the fault of is the frightfully complex nature of estate duty over the years with piecemeal legislation and amendments, and this has given rise to quite a considerable amount of trouble. Very often the valuation and assessment of estate duty was many years removed from the valuation of the property that was the subject of the <Col N="2134" /> transaction, say, for the sale.  I am only approaching it from the point of view of a sale.  We are talking about certificates.  I do not perceive the same trouble arising under this Act because you are dealing with the sale.  It gives you the value.  You are also not going to be dealing with the complex rules you had under estate duty.  It will be a far simpler Act.</P>

It is a terrible morass at times to go through, and if anybody wants to prove how disturbed a lawyer's mind can be in the estate duty world all he has to do is look at some of my work from the point of view of vendor and purchaser on the estate duty section.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not think Deputy de Valera need be worried about the office of the Revenue Commissioners becoming clogged up if there are the same number of applications as under the estate duty code.  Under the estate duty code there were applications for personal property and for practically every sale.  A sale might be part of a person's property.  Without sales at all executors apply for certificates of discharge from death duties in respect of the entire assets before distributing.  In the estate duty code there is aggregation. Estate duty might be paid at 5 or 6 per cent.  There was not any guarantee that that was the end of it. Here once wealth tax is paid at 1 per cent that is the end of it.</P>
      <P>There is provision in this section in order to facilitate people that a certificate discharging property may in certain cases be issued even when the tax is not being paid.  If the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the tax will be paid, supposing that a reputable executor or a bank executor or the Land Commission are involved, or if there is some way of being reasonably sure, they may issue a certificate.</P>

      <P>In page 21, subsection (1), to delete lines 47 to 50 inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) of this section provides broadly that if the taxpayer can show that the combination of wealth tax and income tax in one year exceeds 80 per cent of his income the Commissioners shall repay to him the amount by which the combined total exceeds that 80 per cent.  It goes on to say that despite that he is to pay at least 50 per cent of the wealth tax. The consequence of that is that in some cases, admittedly not very many cases and cases in which there is likely to be a good deal of money involved, there can be a liability for more than 100 per cent of income.  I suggest that in any such case with this proviso operating what will happen amounts to confiscation.  The taxpayer concerned, if obliged to pay more than the total amount of his income, has got to sell off some of the property in order to pay the wealth tax.  If it were a temporary situation he could borrow.  If he has to pay more than 100 per cent of his <Col N="2137" /> income for any length of time, the only way he can do it is to sell off some of his property compulsorily in order to pay the tax.  If that happens I would suggest it is getting very close to confiscation.  This section with that proviso is of doubtful constitutional validity.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not accept the Deputy's argument. I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The Deputy has admitted that the situation which he worries about will arise in extremely exceptional circumstances.  I would go further and say that the situation could not arise in normal circumstances and would only arise in manipulated circumstances.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 21 provides a ceiling for the wealth tax payable in the case of the individual.  It provides that the combined total of income and wealth tax is not to exceed 80 per cent of the income of the individual.  The proviso to this subsection provides that 50 per cent of the wealth tax as assessed must be paid in any event.  The amendment proposes that this floor of 50 per cent be abolished.  The result would be that no wealth tax would be payable in the case where the owner of property had no income and would be greatly reduced where the income was small relative to the value of the taxable wealth.  Thus if a married individual had taxable wealth of £1 million and no income no wealth tax would be payable.  If he had wealth of £1 million and £1,000 income, £748 wealth tax would be payable.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On wealth amounting to £1 million and £5,000 income £2,670 wealth tax will be payable.  The wealth tax on taxable wealth of £1 million at 1 per cent is £10,000.  It will be seen, therefore, that a man with £1 million if his income was so arranged could really defeat the charge for wealth tax.  As the section stands £5,000 wealth tax would be payable in any of the above cases.  The examples <Col N="2138" /> chosen are extreme.  However, they pinpoint the problem and underline the principles which are valid for wealth tax payers at all levels.  It is clear that tax can be avoided or mitigated by keeping income at a minimum. This can be done by minimising income as such.</P>
      <P>I repeat that it is clear that tax can be avoided or mitigated by keeping income at a minimum.  This can be done by minimising income as such.  It can also be done by investing in property which provides little or no return.  It is, therefore, necessary to prevent the avoidance of tax. The wealthier a taxpayer the more scope he has for avoiding tax in the absence of a floor.  His opportunities and his means of living off his capital are greater and for reasons of equity, a floor is essential.  Again an extreme but much quoted example makes the point; the millionaire in the first example because of lack of income pays no wealth tax; neither does a beggar, yet nobody would claim their capital situations are similar.  It is illogical that income alone should determine the amount of an individual's wealth tax.  In examples 2 and 3, the wealth tax payable increases from £748 to £2,670 merely because one individual has a higher income although their capital position is similar.  The absence of a floor would encourage wealth tax payers not to put their wealth to the greatest use and discourage investment as such.  For all these reasons the proposal to abolish the floor is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Finally there can be no question of hardship.  The 0.5 per cent floor has reference only to taxable wealth. When regard is had to the high thresholds and the generous exemptions in the Bill, the effective rate of the floor <i>vis-á-vis</i> the taxpayer's entire wealth will, in the vast majority of cases where the floor will operate, be well below that figure.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> No.  It is a tax on wealth as distinct from income tax.  Of course, if it were solely income tax it would be irrational to expect a man to pay more in income tax than his income.  That is not proposed here.  This is a separate or distinct tax.  In the days of death duties the widow was not asked what income she had, she was not asked what income her husband had.  She was politely asked to hand over to the Revenue Commissioners 55 per cent in certain cases of her husband's wealth without any reference, good, bad or indifferent to the income that her husband had or to the income that she had, or without any reference as to whether the husband had provided liquid cash to pay the estate duty or as to whether she would have to sell the estate to pay the duty. That was a much more brutal and ruthless attack on the wealth of an individual.  In the vast majority of cases where the floor will apply it will have arisen in cases where the position is not real but manipulated.  I think the comparison I have given in regard to the death duty situation, together with the example I have given from my brief, justify retention of the floor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The relief that is given in subsection (1) is of very little value to a number of classes of persons. If you take a farmer whose herd is affected by brucellosis or any other major disease, or indeed if there is a bad cycle of weather, or alternatively a businessman who finds he is trading at a loss, in either case they may have no income for a period of two or three years.  Being in that position they are not likely to be able to raise a loan.  They certainly could not do it very easily.  Yet there are no provisions here which will ease their liability for wealth tax.  It seems to be one of the major drawbacks in the proposals in the Bill.  To have no provision for any easing or exemption in a case where a person finds he is operating at a loss and, therefore, has no income with which to pay it is not very satisfactory.  There should be <Col N="2141" /> provision to give exemption for, say, farmers, who are affected by disease in their herds, or businessmen going through a bad patch and trading at a loss.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I note that the relief that is being given is confined to the individual.  It is not, apparently, proposed to apply it to the private nontrading company or the discretionary trust.  Again, it is not clear to me why that should be so but because not even the relief in the section is being given, there is graver danger of what amounts to confiscation in those cases.</P>
      <P>Should not the relief, such as it is, be available to a person who is ordinarily resident here, even if not domiciled here?  He could be here for very many years and still not be domiciled here.  I am not quite clear why it should be refused to somebody who is ordinarily resident here.</P>
      <P>In regard to subsection (2) which provides that tax shall not be paid more than once in respect of the same property on the relevant valuation date and the same property shall not be included more than once in taxable wealth on that date, there ought to be an addition to that subsection to provide that wealth tax and death duties would not be payable on the same property after 5th April, 1975. When speaking about death duties I am not including death duties which arose before 5th April and were not paid.  I mentioned on an earlier section the sections under which they arise, but we ought to make certain in that subsection that liability for wealth tax and death duties should not arise on the same property after 5th April, 1975.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Colley makes the point that a person may have a bad year and may have no income and that in such case he should be completely exempt from wealth tax.  Wealth tax comes into play only in the case of persons of considerable wealth.  There are other forms of tax in this country&mdash;I will not go back to death duty again &mdash;and they did apply to people who had no income and, indeed, to people <Col N="2142" /> who might have owed money on the security of the property which was being taxed.</P>
      <P>Then there are rates that are in operation here for years.  These are levied on wealthy people and poor people.  In neither case do they take into consideration the ability of the person to pay.  Under the wealth tax a married farmer can have 240 acres of land and other property worth a total of £250,000 and be completely exempt from tax.  He can have property worth £326,000 and the rate of tax is only .09 per cent.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want them to pay too much before July 5th.  The purpose of subsection (2) of this section is to pay interest on overpaid wealth tax which under subsection (1) falls to be repaid or retained on foot of outstanding tax.  The interest on the overpaid tax is to be calculated from the later of two dates, the date of payment of the excess tax or the date three <Col N="2145" /> months after the valuation date at the rate of 1.5 per cent per month or 18 per cent per annum.  The significance of the three months lies in the fact of the interest-free period which is extended to 5th December of this year. The amendment proposed by Deputy Colley seeks to delete the reference to three months with the result that interest on the excess tax will be calculated from the date of payment of the tax irrespective of when it was paid.  The amendment is not acceptable for the following reason, to accept it would involve paying interest on tax in respect of a period during which interest is not charged.</P>

It is going to include cases where people have no income because of losses suffered, as I have outlined <Col N="2147" /> earlier.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The reason behind the rejection of the amendment is as follows: section 22 of the Bill deals with cases where there has been an overpayment of tax and allows interest on an overpayment at the rate of 1.5 per cent per month from the date of payment to the date of repayment of the tax.  The subsection which it is sought to delete provides, however, that an overpayment under section 21 should not carry interest.  The repayment under this latter section arises only where the total of the wealth tax and income tax exceeds 80 per cent of the income.  The effect of the amendment would be that a repayment under this ceiling provision would carry interest. The amendment is not acceptable.  As the rate of wealth tax is only 1 per cent and the effective rate is generally somewhat lower, the ceiling provision will arise only where the total income of the taxpayer is abnormally low in relation to the value of the property he possesses.  In the case of an individual, if it is abnormally low income it would obviously be in his interest to postpone as long as possible the settlement of his tax affairs or his application for a refund in the sure knowledge that he would be in receipt <Col N="2148" /> of interest at the rate of 1.5 per cent per month from the overpayment, a return far in excess of what he was earning on his own capital.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, an individual who has his affairs so arranged that his income is abnormally low has little or no equity in seeking a good rate of interest in an overpayment at the expense of the State, particularly so if his low income policy is designed to reduce income tax liability and wealth tax liability.  An overpayment in the ordinary course may be set off against any other outstanding liability on the date on which the repayment falls to be made.  The overpayment in the ceiling case is not subject to such set off as the Bill stands, though it provides little or no income.  The floor is therefore necessary to prevent the avoidance of tax.  The wealthier the taxpayer is the more scope he has for avoiding tax in the absence of a floor.  His opportunity and his means of living off his capital are greater.  For reasons of equity a floor is essential.  Again an extreme but much quoted example makes the point.  The millionaire in the first example because of his lack of income pays no wealth tax.  Neither does the beggar, as I have said before.  Yet nobody would claim that their capital situations are similar.  It is also illogical that income alone should determine the amount of an individual's wealth tax.</P>

      <P>In pages 22 and 23, to delete subsection (4).</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) provides:</P>
      <P>An appeal under this section against an assessment shall not be proceeded with or entertained by the Appeal Commissioners unless an amount equal to 75 per cent. of the amount of the assessment is paid to the Commissioners by or on behalf of the appellant.</P>
      <P>There is a proviso that this subsection shall not apply where the appellant is aggrieved on the ground that he is not an accountable person, in other words that they are charging the wrong man.  Otherwise on the amount, and so on, he cannot bring an appeal unless he lodges 75 per cent of what he has been assessed on.</P>
      <P>I have the gravest doubts about this provision.  There could be a gross over-assessment.  The possibility is acknowledged in the proviso where there could be an assessment on the wrong person.  Similarly there could be, by mistake, a gross over-assessment. It would be unjust to force a taxpayer to pay 75 per cent of the tax assessed on this gross over-payment, merely in order to exercise his right of appeal.  I would not mind a provision which made the taxpayer liable from the date of the original assessment on the amount that he was found under appeal to be liable for until the date of payment, assuming he paid no tax prior to the appeal.  I would have no objection to that kind of provision.  I suggest that this subsection is going much too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I wonder about the constitutional validity of such a provision.  In the ordinary case maybe it would not impose an undue obligation but in the kind of case I have outlined where, by <Col N="2150" /> mistake or otherwise, presumably by mistake, there is a gross over-assessment, to impose on the taxpayer the obligation before he can even exercise his right of appeal, to pay 75 per cent of that assessment, I suggest, is going much too far.  I wonder why is it that under section 23, where there is a reference to an appeal in regard to the value of real property, no such provision is imposed.  It seems to me that this subsection ought to be deleted and I am urging the Minister to do that.</P>

      <P>This situation is likely to arise only when both parties are in a dispute position and when both parties, the Revenue Commissioners and the other party, are driven to making extremes of that case and the probability of an over-assessment is very great.  The Revenue Commissioners will be put in the position of a party in court who naturally have to make the best and the safest case they can make.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The amendment seeks the deletion of subsection (4) of section 24 which provides that 75 per cent of the wealth tax assessed must be paid before there can be an appeal against the assessment. The necessity for this provision can be seen in the context of the tax as a whole and the circumstances generally.  The effective rate of tax is low and the taxpayers are wealthy. The taxpayers because of their wealth have expert advice available.  The appeals procedure is simple and inexpensive. On the other hand, the administration will be in its weakest condition in the earlier years of the tax.  In such circumstances a taxpayer has nothing to lose by appealing.  In any matter of doubt he would be foolish not to have a go.  If this were done on any substantial scale it would have two effects.  It would postpone the payment of tax and clog up the administration of the tax and the field machinery.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am coming to that.  Especially in the <Col N="2151" /> case of a new tax there would be speculative appeals, the more so as the appellant would have nothing to lose. It is essential, therefore, that there would be a substantial payment on account to discourage the appeals.  The amendment is unacceptable.  I wish to emphasise, however, that there can be no question of hardship in this provision since, in the event of an appeal being successful, interest at 18 per cent per annum will be payable on the tax which is being refunded.</P>

In fact I introduced provisions under another code whereby you could make an appeal without any lodgement of that kind, but you were liable for interest from the date of original assessment on the amount to be due.  I think that is a reasonable approach.  The approach in subsection (4) is quite unreasonable and will be oppressive on a number of taxpayers in preventing them from exercising their rights.  It is no answer to say that they will get interest on the money over-paid.  Thanks very much if you can find the money.</P>

    <P>With regard to the industrial development programme, the Industrial Development Authority and the Shannon Free Airport Development Co.

In addition at one industrial estate the authority have three factory units, with a floor area of 112,500 sq. ft. under construction and are also constructing nine factories at different locations for specific projects.  The total floor area of these nine factories is 637,350 sq.ft.</P>

      <P>In regard to local authorities, the contact between the IDA, which is responsible for the development of IDA sites, and the local authorities is a very close one.  In addition there are instances where, arising from these contacts or from other initiatives, the local authorities provide serviced industrial sites.  In regard to those sites the IDA land bank facilities are available and the range of incentives are available to factories locating on the sites.  It is not an area where I have any indication that the current mechanisms are inadequate.  It seems to me that the rather flexible mechanism between the IDA and the individual local authorities is working well.  Of course, the full range of subsidies, and other aids, are available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The original suggestion for a surveillance system was contained in an EEC Commission working document of 17th December 1974. but the system envisaged in this document was far more limited than the one that has now been introduced. My Department sought clarification on different occasions from the Commission as to the maximum limits to which the surveillance could be extended, and this took a certain amount of time because of the complexities involved.  A procedure of consultations among member states had also to be gone through before <Col N="2157" /> surveillance could be introduced on footwear with leather uppers, which is a liberalised item under EEC Rules.</P>
      <P>Certain legal problems in the preparation of the necessary instruments, as well as the administrative arrangements that had to be put in train, made it impossible to introduce the system of surveillance earlier than it was done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that it was introduced somewhat more than five months after the EEC suggested it should be done and, in the meantime, some of the damage which it might have prevented was done to the Irish footwear and textile industries? Is it not a fact that other countries had this system in operation successfully?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the distinction in my reply between the original suggestion of the Commission which could have been introduced very quickly, that was applying to non-liberalised products and applying to the United Kingdom only.  In our view that was not sufficient, and the final result was that we applied it to non-liberalised products from all countries &mdash;all, in its widest sense and not just all Community countries&mdash;and also to liberalised products from third countries.  The importance of the liberalised products from third countries is that under the relevant tariff head 80 per cent of our own production, footwear with leather uppers, is under that liberalised tariff head.  The original proposals of the Commission could have been implemented more quickly but would not have given us that protection at all.  The final package that emerged was a result of considerable to-ing and fro-ing between us and the Commission and also consultations with the other member states.  I am satisfied that while it did take longer than I or anyone else wished, the extensions from the UK to all countries for non-liberalised products and the introduction of the liberalised products in regard to third countries were in fact, of benefit.  That counteracted the delay, which is real and which I regret.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>When one says bases there are separate things involved.  The question refers to an offshore service base.  There is the base for the actual exploration and then, if there are finds. <Col N="2159" /> there is the base for the exploitation which is a much more long-term thing. In regard to preliminary drilling, firms are in a hurry, quite properly, and in that case existing facilities have an advantage because a facility cannot be pulled out of the air under about 18 months or two years.  It is not possible to do it that quickly, even with the best will in the world.  In regard to the more long-term servicing of production facilities we would certainly have an influence because we have, for example, the matter of the licensing of sites for the production of rigs and the studies going on in regard to the location of refineries.  This is an area where one wants the best commercial practice and one ought to listen to the opinions of those who are risking their capital to provide a service.  While they should not be left complete freedom, it is well to listen to them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that because of the bottling strike during the Christmas period huge amounts of spirits were imported to substitute for the lack of the Irish products, and that this situation contributed largely to our adverse trade balance?</P>

      <P>The question relates to exports, but I am pleased to say that in 1974 compared with 1972, for example, there was an almost 40 per cent increase in exports.  I am aware that there was a replacement on the home market for home-produced spirits during the period of the strike, but the situation has recovered satisfactorily since then.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the existence of long-established and acceptable forms of roadside selling, I do not consider that an absolute prohibition of such selling would be justifiable or feasible, but I am considering whether and to what extent it would be feasible to impose some restrictions on roadside trading to take account of representations which have been made to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this is a growing problem and that those legitimate traders who must pay rent and rates and also VAT are subjected to very unfair competition as a result of this roadside trading?  Apart from health hazards and other considerations, this practice results in a loss to the Exchequer. Consequently, would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that steps should be taken immediately to deal with the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problems referred to by the Deputy. Similar representations have been made to me by two deputations I have received.  Following representations <Col N="2161" /> from my Department to the Revenue Commissioners in October, 1973 action was taken in relation to the sale through such outlets of stolen or smuggled goods.  I understand that considerable progress was made by the Garda authorities in that respect.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other types of abuse to which the Deputy refers, there seems to be a considerable problem of enforcement.  In many cases it was found almost impossible to serve summonses because of the difficulty in identifying and pinning down the itinerant sales people concerned. Where arrest or seizure of property was concerned, there was much difficulty in some cases and where prosecution succeeded the penalities under old Acts were trivial in present day terms.  This whole matter is complex and difficult but I am having an examination carried out in regard to it at the moment.</P>

In December, 1974, the Minister decided that the order should remain in force.  My information is that the order is being enforced and that in relation to Dundalk, an undertaking was given to the court that no further breaches of the order would occur.

      <P>I understand that the relevant passage from the National Prices Commission Report was drawn to the attention of the National Consumers' Advisory Council and circulated to the membership.  However, <Col N="2168" /> the NCAC have been extensively involved since their foundation in the preparation of recommendations for legislation and, with the exception of certain matters relating to food products, have not got down to individual problems such as the drafting of such a code.  I would agree that such a code would be useful, and I think it should be a voluntary code which might be drawn up in the long run in consultation between the NCAC and the retail interests involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2170" /> My Department proposed to the manager the amalgamation of Letterleague school with the new school at Glenswilly as being in the best educational interests of the pupils. The manager and the majority of the parents agreed to this proposal and the amalgamation came into effect on 1st July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the parents in this area, who had come to know of the proposed closure some months ago, had meetings with the manager and subsequently with an inspector of the Minister's Department, and that arising from those meetings it was expected and indeed it was promised that they would be given the ultimate decision of the Department before anything was done, and is he aware that this did not happen?  Is he aware that they were ultimately made aware of the closure by the bus driver who was doing a test run on the 30th June, and he told the teacher of the school that it was closing the following day and that he would be around to collect the children and take them to Glenswilly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that only about one-third of the parents who attended the meeting in question were opposed to the amalgamation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there are three families whose children travel on the bus since it has been provided, and three families out of the entire area is far from being a third of the total?  Might I make this plea to the Minister, as I have already done to his Department, that during the period of the holidays which have just commenced there should be a reappraisal of the decision to close Letterleague National School?  There are very good reasons.  Glenswilly cannot take all the pupils, who now number 61, in Letterleague.  Double transport has been provided, one bus going to the Drumkeen school and another going to the Glenswilly school. In the area there is a growing population, evident from the number of new houses being built on the fringe of Letterkenny, which is bursting at the seams.  I can see a school being <Col N="2171" /> built in Letterleague in order to accommodate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Surely this is not the case and that the decision to amalgamate was on the way long before there was any question of the retirement of these teachers, and the appointment of temporary substitutes, that this has been going on for a long time behind the scenes if not in the forefront.</P>

May I ask the Minister to take everything into consideration and to amalgamate the schools where there is no conflict?  As I have said before, if amalgamations took place where there is no conflict as to the teachers' willingness to move, the manager's willingness to aid or the parents' willingness to send their children long distances to other schools, there is enough work to keep the Department and their building section going over the next 20 years, with no rows at all.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education why Rashina national schol, County Offaly, is being closed in view of the fact that it is a two-teacher school catering for 60 local children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in the case of Rashina national school is that future prospective enrolments are expected to decline to a figure of 30 pupils by the year 1979.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the reorganisation of primary schooling facilities in the area have been under consideration for some time, and it is felt that the educational interests of all the children involved would best be served by an arrangement whereby the three existing two-teacher schools at Rashina, Bloomhill and Ballinahowen would be replaced by a central school in a new building to be erected at Ballinahowen.</P>
      <P>My information is that following a recent meeting at which the proposed amalgamation was explained to the parents of the area, a substantial majority of the parents voted in favour of the amalgamation.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are, therefore, being made for the provision of the new central school building at Ballinahowen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the type of statistics which would enable me to reply precisely to the Deputy's question.  I can, however, quote for his information the following extracts from the Teachers' Handbook issued in 1971 with the New Curriculum for Primary Schools:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of print script during the early years is considered worth while, because the child avoids the difficulty involved in learning diverse shapes or different letters of the alphabet, and perhaps more important, because it enables the closer integration of the beginnings of reading and writing.  From the outset, children can compare their own work with the printed word, <Col N="2185" /> and detect errors, particularly in letter formation.</P>
    <P>It is advisable to select one system of handwriting for use through the school.  When children have mastered the beginnings of reading and writing to a degree where the use of print script no longer brings special advantage, the question of transfer to cursive writing may be considered.  Some schools never make such a transfer, since the fluency and grace of well-shaped print script allow for speed and for style in handwriting.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section that raises the ceiling of borrowing of the corporation.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a number of questions on this section.  The Parliamentary Secretary will agree that since December, 1972, there has been a dramatic drop in agricultural production. There has been a dramatic drop in the numbers of each kind of livestock, whether it be cattle, sheep, pigs or poultry.  Since the purpose of the Agricultural Credit Corporation is the building up of these herds and <Col N="2191" /> flocks it would be interesting if the Parliamentary Secretary would give us some estimate of the drop in numbers of each of these sectors of the farming picture.  Unless we know this it would be impossible to determine the degree to which the borrowing ceiling must be raised. Obviously, there must be a considerable raising of the ceiling to make up for the damage done to the herds and flocks by the Government in the last two and a half years.  I would be grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary if he would tell us what the relationship is now between the July, 1970 £ and the £ that would have been lent by the credit corporation in December, 1972.</P>
      <P>When one considers the individual applications for loans to the Agricultural Credit Corporation one must, naturally, take into consideration the disastrous effects inflation has brought about and the necessity for the size of loans being raised to be far greater than they might have been if inflation did not intervene.  As the Taoiseach has said, a great deal of this inflation has been caused by the Government.  Who better, then, is there to ask than the representative of the Government if he would be good enough to tell us by what amount we ought to compensate our figures in estimating the appropriate ceiling to which the borrowing by the corporation should be allowed?</P>
      <P>The prospects are not bright for the rebuilding of the herds.  I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary could give us some estimate of the numbers of suckler cows we have as against the numbers we did have in March, 1973, or December, 1972.  The numbers would not vary greatly in those three months.  It is beyond question that that section of the cattle herd suffered greatly.  It had consequent repercussions on the whole on the cattle herd and, in particular, in the matter of the price of calves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the consideration of the raising of the borrowing ceiling of the corporation it is necessary for the intelligent consideration of section 2 that we should know by how many&mdash;to <Col N="2192" /> the nearest ten thousand would do&mdash; the beef herd has been destroyed by the present Government.  If we remain in ignorance of this figure it will not be possible to determine precisely to what level the borrowing ceiling should be raised.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, especially since he adverted to it in his Second Reading speech, the amount of borrowing that has been undertaken by farmer co-operatives, in particular, dairy co-operatives and meat factories.  The position is that we have diminishing dairy farmer returns, practically no market for calves and an impending operation of what the European Commission calls financial co-responsibility, in other words an impending threat of a reduction in the price of milk and a consequent incapacity of the big dairying co-operatives to maintain the milk price.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary the amount of dairy co-operative borrowing in each of the past three years and if there are any projections of dairy co-operative borrowings for the next six months or 12 months.  With the extraordinarily rapid expansion of the dairy manufacturing industry that took place under Fianna Fáil Governments, in confident anticipation of further expansion, many of the big dairy co-operative manufacturing combines are heavily indebted to the credit corporation and to other lending agencies.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 it is a necessary piece of information we must have for consideration.  We need the information to ascertain with some degree of accuracy the amounts of borrowing undertaken by the dairy co-operatives for the purposes of expansion and of diversifying production.</P>
    <P>The Avonmore group of co-operatives have diversified very widely in the matter of the provision of casein plants, cheese plants, lactose plants and whey plants, all in the matter of the past few years.  I imagine this was substantially financed by borrowing in anticipation of the maintenance of an increasing flow of milk upon which all the calculations of the combined <Col N="2193" /> society were based in order to ensure a profitable situation being maintained. This, of course, has been sabotaged by the incapacity of the Government to maintain the progress we established.  I fear that some, at least of the co-operative combines may find themselves in an embarrassing situation of having to surcharge their dairy milk suppliers in the price they get per gallon in order to maintain the service of their debts.</P>
    <P>Turning to the meat manufacturing co-operatives, firms like Clover Meats, and International Meat Packers, I should like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position&mdash;I realise and acknowledge that it is not quite within his province&mdash;to inform the House as to the progress made in relation to the committee established by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in order to enquire into the alleged malpractices of last year especially.  One suspects that they are still continuing in the business of the purchase and processing of intervention cattle.  I hope this committee would have enquired into the means of access to the intervention market that was provided to the ordinary mortal who was not endowed with the good contacts that appear necessary to have in order to sell cattle into intervention.</P>
    <P>It is beyond doubt that the meat manufacturing undertakings, private and co-operative, must have made substantial profits.  Some of it was legitimate but some of it, I regret to say, may be suspect.  In all these cases it is true to say that the enterprises would have been financed to some degree by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I would be grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary if he would inform the House with some precision as to the borrowing situation, the amounts borrowed by the individual plants in each of the last three or four years.  Having already asked the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some coefficient for the correction of relative values, say, of 1972 as against 1975, it should be a simple matter enough by the use of the coefficient to correct values in order to get some fairly accurate sense of relativity into the assessment of the <Col N="2194" /> annual borrowings by these undertakings.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in his Second Stage speech mentioned the fact that grain merchants and others have access to borrowing facilities from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. This may be all well and good but what is beyond question is that merchants such as these have striven greatly in the past couple of decades, especially grain and feed merchants. Under the benign influence of the vigorous tillage policy pursued here it is now undergoing some strain&mdash; one wonders as a farmer whether in a different borrowing climate access to this source of borrowing should not be limited to actual farming practitioners and that the merchants the Parliamentary Secretary referred to be referred to other sources for credit.</P>
    <P>I realise the part these merchants and co-operatives play.  I am talking in particular about the private merchants. I realise that the part they play in the general agricultural economic structure is an important one.</P>
    <P>I submit that by definition and by title the Agricultural Credit Corporation seems to support a special agency for the provision of credit for the farming industry alone.  This, naturally, would embrace co-operatives, dairy co-operatives, meat manufacturing co-operatives.  It is not as easy to see that it should also embrace private merchants who may have access to other sources of borrowing.</P>
    <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary give us some estimate of the slack we must make up in order to bring ourselves back to the position we would have been in at the end of 1972?  Could he give us a corrected figure, if possible, or an actual figure and the coefficient in order to do the correction ourselves, of the quantities borrowed every year by farmers in the last three or four years?  It will be necessary to take into consideration the enormous inflation of the Irish pound that has taken place in the intervening period because, in the words of the Taoiseach, of the responsibility of the Irish Government for creating the situation.</P>
    <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary, <Col N="2195" /> or some of his back-up officials provide us with some figures to point out the dramatic drop there has been in the number of suckler cows in that section of the beef herd?  Lastly, could he fill us in on the amounts borrowed by, first of all, co-operative dairy enterprises and co-operative meat enterprises.  Secondly, by similar enterprises, mainly in the meat sector, that are not co-operatives and lastly, general borrowings by merchants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Parliamentary Secretary replies I should like to deal with the Bill.  This is a Bill that everybody welcomes.  The amount of money allocated to the Agricultural Credit Corporation is being increased from £120 million to £220 million and this is welcomed. The farming community have shown a great capacity if given encouragement. If given the opportunity and credit they are prepared to put their shoulders to the wheel and make their industry expand.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the points raised by Deputy Gibbons.  As someone who is involved in agriculture I was disappointed with his attitude. His approach does not offer encouragement to the farming community. No matter what phase the agricultural industry is going through, instead of a &lsquo;beal bocht&rsquo; attitude towards that industry it needs vigour, determination and goodwill from this House.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that in regard to the Agricultural Credit Corporation we should realise that the amount of money lent by them increased from £6 million in 1968-69 to £29 million in 1972-73 and in the current year they advanced £40 million to farmers and £16 million to other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural community had a difficult period during 1974, but the farmers are looking forward to considerable expansion in the coming year.  The approach and the initiative the Agricultural Credit Corporation have shown in increasing their loans from £6 million in 1968-69 to a total of £56 million in 1974-75 for farmers and other people shows the confidence <Col N="2196" /> they have in the future of farming. The people should be told that we in this House recognise that the farming community are quite prepared, as they have been always in the past, to look for credit to enable them to expand their industry and their business.</P>
    <P>We can discuss difficult times&mdash;I do not want to turn this into a political football because it would be unwise at this stage to do so&mdash;but we will have to look at some figures.  If we study the figures for the number of people employed in agriculture we see the decrease in the farm labour force during the periods from 1951 to 1961 and from 1961 to 1971.  Those who passed through this House during that 20 years and others concerned with agriculture will have to look into their hearts for the reason for the decrease in the numbers engaged in agriculture from 491,000 in 1951 to 372,000 in 1961 and down to 266,000 in 1971.</P>
    <P>These are important figures and they will have to be borne in mind when we are talking about the farming community.  All the Deputies listening in the House at the moment are from country constituencies.  All represent rural Ireland and the farming community.  When we see the decrease from 491,000 to 266,000 in the farm labour force it is time that all of us put our shoulders to the wheel to see where we can help.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gibbons agreed with me before when I spoke about the farm employees holiday scheme.  This Bill may be of help.  If we allow the numbers of those engaged in farming to drop as they have been dropping over the past 20 or 25 years I fear greatly for our agriculture industry.  Without people on our farms rural Ireland, as we know it, will be changed drastically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us here, irrespective of which side of the House we represent, will have to bear this in mind.  We may reach the situation where many farms will not be able to be worked because manpower will not be available.  Without skilled manpower machines cannot <Col N="2197" /> be operated.  A Bill such as this is a step in the right direction.  It indicates that we are trying to do something to stem the flight from the land and to help the people of rural Ireland. Many Deputies wish to speak on the Bill, so I shall be brief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  In regard to section 2, the amount of money allotted has been increased.  A World Bank loan being negotiated will result in £8 million being given to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  There is an important difference between a World Bank loan granted to the ACC and loans being sought by farmers from the ACC.  The ACC can only allow a moratorium for the payment of interest of one-and-a-half years, but the World Bank authorities allow a period of four years during which only the interest is repayable, and not the capital.  There is a significant difference there and it is very important. We know there is a scarcity of money but the Agricultural Credit Corporation will have to provide similar terms for their loans to the farmers from their World Bank loan.</P>
      <P>I am a solicitor and I deal with many of these loans.  Farmers have great difficulty paying back loans, both interest and capital, where repayments commence after a period of six months or 12 months.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary, in consultation with his Minister, to do everything possible in regard to this matter to try to grant a period of approximately four years before capital repayments commence.  This would be similar to the conditions attaching to the ACC loan from the World Bank.  If the Minister can help out with that it would be very desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In granting loans the ACC specify that, if a loan is not taken up within a period of three months or six months, depending on the way in which it is negotiated, it can lapse. There should be some arrangement whereby the ACC would not allow the loan to lapse.  If a person is buying <Col N="2198" /> land, Land Registry and Land Commission consent has to be obtained and other processes may have to take place.  There may be delay, too, on the part of busy solicitors.</P>

      <P>It is unfair to a farmer to find that his loan may have lapsed. At present the banks are reluctant to grant bridging accommodation when the ACC are involved.  I have nothing in writing to prove what I am saying but that is the position.  You will be told politely over the telephone that you will not be accommodated.  It is an important factor, and I would ask this to be borne in mind by the collectors in the agency and by the Minister and the Department of Finance.  I welcome in particular section 4, which deals with remuneration of the chief officer of the corporation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will.  What worries me is that in a number of bodies such as the ACC there are people being paid from part of the money voted through this House, who are not being remunerated on a basis that is equivalent to other bodies.  In <i>The Farming Independent</i> of Saturday, December 14th, 1974 there was a heading which referred to &ldquo;State pay bias against farming boards.&rdquo;  This is something that has been practised for many years. This article says that none of the members of the six agricultural boards are paid whereas members of other boards are.  It says that amazing discrepancies in the money being paid by semi-State boards to chief executives, chairman, and directors are revealed in a <i>Farming Independent</i> investigation, that the salaries of chief executives range from well over £12,000 per year to as little as £4,350.  The article says that the remuneration appears to bear no relation to the importance or responsibility <Col N="2199" /> of the post and that the biggest losers are in the agricultural sector.</P>

      <P>It is in that it ties in with the ACC at the moment.  The point I am getting at is that it is important that the same scales of remuneration should apply to all semiState bodies.  What we have allowed to happen is that people who are involved in the agricultural sector are not being paid on a similar basis to people involved in other sectors.  This must change because we must attract the best people, the best brains, the best ability into Irish agriculture.  Unless we do this, our farming community will not only not be in a position to increase and strengthen their position but they will barely be able to hold their own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. There is no man or woman who has any interest in agriculture who does not welcome the increase to the ACC, but one of the aspects of this increase which worries me is the question of who will benefit from the £100 million extra.  Will the ACC have a policy of being liberal to those people who most need it, because there is an old saying that people who do not need money are those who can borrow it easily?  I come from an area where people have had what the Parliamentary Secretary referred to as a brief recession in farming.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows the situation was worse than a brief recession, especially for those people whose stocks are small, who had some small cattle last year and sheep this year.  These are people who could not afford to manure their lands because of the high cost of fertilisers.  The ACC have always been good to farmers, but I am wondering whether they will use this extra money to help those who borrowed money a couple of years ago for the purpose of stocking their lands but who were not able to live up to their obligations on account of the bad period for farming and who, consequently, lost out.  These people <Col N="2200" /> will be looking for some help in order to be able to take advantage of the change that we hope for in agriculture.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister is taking the French to court.  We asked him to do this a few months ago but he would not agree at that stage to do so.  It is late in the day to take this action now because those who were engaged this year in lamb production were robbed.  The action of the French was a breach of a principle of the Treaty of Rome.  I hope the case against them will be successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to point out the type of people I would like to see benefiting from this £100 million. I have no wish to see the big businesses, be they private or co-operative, benefiting from it.  These people have plenty of money now to apply for more money to borrow to expand.  The ACC have been very helpful down through the years.  I have been associated with small co-operatives which the ACC have kept in operation by their help.  Three or four years ago when we entered the EEC the young people, particularly, were full of confidence.  They borrowed money and spent it on the development of small farms. However, if now through no fault of their own, they are not living up to their obligations, they should not be denied some of this extra money. While it may appear to be a large amount, inflation will take care of some of it.  However, it is welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be difficult at this stage for the smaller farmer to regain confidence, to borrow and to start all over again. We asked for a subsidy for manures but this was not granted.  Now we see factories being closed down, including the Nitrigin Éireann factory.  The farmers have not had enough money to buy manure.  I agree with Deputy Enright that the paying back of principal and interest together over a short period is a big strain on those people.  They should be told to borrow and it should be made easy for them. <Col N="2201" /> They cannot go to the banks as the banks will not lend money to them.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how much of the £40 million that was borrowed by farmers went west of the Shannon?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important question.  Is it being borrowed by a few very large farmers or is it being borrowed by the ordinary small farmers, the people who were hit hardest during the recession last year? Could we get some indication of who borrowed the £15 million last year? If we got an indication of where the money went to we would know what we were voting it for.  The ACC are getting a little bit tight about giving out money because they fear they will not be able to meet their obligations because of lack of funds.</P>
      <P>I would like to see people encouraged to borrow money.  We are hoping for things to change.  Some young people I know have borrowed very heavily and were advised to borrow money.  But if they were asked to borrow money again they would reply that they had a millstone around their necks for long enough.  Unless there is an incentive for them to borrow they will not do so.</P>
      <P>The land in my area is not as well stocked as it was.  Cattle and sheep prices are very bad.  There is a complete absence of manure buying.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give some indication of what part of the country the £40 million borrowed by farmers went to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill.  I hope this money will be used wisely.  I would like to see less and less going into the bigger combines and more and more into the farmers' pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACC should set up some kind of advisory scheme for young farmers before they start distributing money.  Quite a lot of this money has not been used to the best advantage. Far too much of it, especially when <Col N="2202" /> things are bad, is put into elaborate buildings.  Stocking and fertilisers are more important than elaborate buildings. £1,000 could be spent on a collecting yard when a few tons of pulp for the cows would be more beneficial. I would like more restrictions imposed at the time of borrowing by the ACC.  I would like to see this money spent on real investment, stocks, fertilisers, and so on.</P>
    <P>It might be a good idea if some of the money was spent on interest free or even low interest loans for farmers for fertilisers.  If anything is to put on the brake on agriculture at the moment it is the lack of the use of fertilisers.  It is the greatest damaging factor at the moment.  I only hope that farmers can be encouraged to use fertilisers.</P>
    <P>The ACC should not be looking for deadlines when it comes to repayments. Farming is a dicey game. Three weeks of wet weather from now until harvest time could wipe out a very valuable grain crop.  Disease can also wipe out crops.  Those of us who have borrowed know that when things are bad that is the time the weather will co-operate with every other factor in keeping one down.  The ACC should adopt an approach completely different from that of the commercial banks.  They should be lenient towards them in the bad years and allow them off the hook until such time as inevitably they will honour their commitments.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the ACC, together perhaps with the co-operative societies and Farm Business Development, go into the banking field, as they do in some European countries. In this type of set-up a lot more sympathy would be obtained for Irish agriculture than would be obtained from a purely commercial bank.  Now that money is scarce it might not be a bad time to think about it.  The commercial banks do not show enough sympathy towards farmers.  It is time the co-operative societies, with the ACC plus the FBD got together and started out on their own.  Agriculture is our basic source of wealth.  When agriculture starts to go downhill and <Col N="2203" /> when employment in agriculture starts falling off the whole country goes into a recession.</P>
    <P>I hope this money is used in enterprises that will give the most profitable return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the other speakers in welcoming this Bill, which provides additional money for the ACC.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by the previous speakers.  Sentiments expressed here are useless unless the lead is given by the Government.  If we look back on the last two years in Irish agriculture we cannot truthfully say that any lead has been given by the Government in this field.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is our major industry. I cannot see any other industry surviving the way agriculture has survived over the past two years.  Farmers have suffered dreadful losses through bad cattle prices.  The Government have done very little in coming to their aid.  Some schemes which were introduced held out great hope to the farmers in the west of Ireland but unfortunately when they were introduced they did not help that much.  I am thinking particularly of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Regional Fund.  I fear that the Regional Fund will not help us in the west as we had hoped it would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Enright criticised Deputy Gibbons for his béal bocht attitude in relation to Irish farming.  Deputy Gibbons cannot be accused of this. If highlighting the problems that affect Irish farming can be termed the béal bocht attitude then we all have to participate in the béal bocht attitude. We all have to strive to get better conditions for the Irish farmers. Deputy Gibbons was merely trying to highlight the problems that affect farmers at present.  We know that our national herd is being destroyed.  This is unfortunate because much money was spent by the previous Government in trying to build up this herd. They had succeeded in building up a fine national herd.  It is a pity to see it destroyed because markets are so <Col N="2204" /> unstable and farmers do not know from day to day where they are going. It is important that the Minister for Agriculture and the Government should give a lead in this respect and that agricultural industries should be carefully planned.  We should have some national plan emerging now for Irish agriculture.  This is not the case, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset it would be impossible for any of our industries to survive if there was not somebody at the head to give the lead; if there was not some plan for exports and some plan for markets.  This is what is needed at the present time in Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered if the ACC are given an opportunity of going into the foreign market and trying to get clients from England and America to invest in the ACC here.  This is something that could be followed up very successfully by the ACC if they were given permission to do so by the Government.  I do not know if they have ever tried it or not, but I am sure that there are many Irish people in England and America who would be only too glad to invest in the ACC and would be only too glad to put some of their savings into this country if they were given the opportunity. The ACC might follow this up and see if they could do this.  I am not sure if the Government would allow it or not.  Perhaps they would be going into competition with the Government.  It is certainly something that would be worth while following up.  We know well that farmers over the past two years have tried to avail of credit facilities and many of them, as other speakers have pointed out, have suffered as a result of this due to the falling markets.</P>
    <P>When going to borrow it is necessary for farmers to have drawn up a careful plan.  There is no use in any farmer, big or small, going to the Agricultural Credit Corporation or to any other lending institution and asking for money if he has not some worth-while plan to put this money into production.  This is where many of the farmers have got caught over the last two years.  They have not <Col N="2205" /> planned their enterprise as they should have done.  The officers of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the agricultural advisory service could work better together and ensure that farmers are given the right kind of advice when they are availing of credit facilities of this kind.  If farmers are going to borrow they should make sure that they have a good plan drawn up for them by an experienced man from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or from the advisory service.  If they did this we would not have as many casualties as we have had over the last two years.</P>
    <P>We all know that money can be got from the World Bank.  Here again it would be impossible for any ordinary farmer to fill up the number of application forms that are required to qualify for a loan of this kind. Deputy Enright mentioned that he has filled up many of these forms.  I agree that it would take a solicitor to answer all the questions that are asked in relation to these kind of applications. I can never understand why applications of this kind cannot be simplified.  No ordinary farmer could give adequate answers to all the questions asked.  If they were simplified perhaps more farmers would be inclined to avail of these loans.</P>
    <P>I agree with the other speakers who mentioned the serious plight in which farmers have found themselves in the past two years.  Now perhaps there is a chance for the market to show an upward trend although there is not much sign of that yet.  Farmers who have suffered over the past two years and who have been put in such a terrible plight by falling markets and so on should be helped now to try to get them over this situation.  There is no point in coming along and telling those farmers that they did not fulfil their obligations for the last two years and accordingly they cannot qualify for further loans.  It would be far better if some of this money could be spent in helping to get those farmers out of the mess they have got into through no fault of their own.  I would support any move made to provide interest-free loans for that kind of farmer.  Most of them borrowed money in good faith.  They were led <Col N="2206" /> to believe that everything was going to be rosy and that they could improve their herd and take land.  They did this at very high prices.  Unfortunately they got their fingers burned but it was not their fault.  For that reason I think they should not be victimised.  They should be helped to get over this because it is important for all of us that the farming community be helped.  It is important for the nation that every farmer who can survive should be helped to do so and that we keep as many farmers as possible on the land.  We could do this by giving them interest-free loans to get them over this very difficult situation. If they got over this year they might be in a better position to survive in the years ahead.</P>

In the present climate and with the great guarantees of the CAP, progressive farmers could borrow up to almost 50 per cent of their assets.</P>

Our natural environment is under steady and constant attack and it is not a static situation.  It is growing steadily worse.  Every day sees some further deterioration in our natural environment.  The greatest and the most tragic mistake we can make is to regard this subject of the protection of the environment, conservation, as something which can be left to cranks or eccentrics.  It is a matter of vital, practical, urgent importance. The public interest is vitally involved in it.  The health, happiness and wellbeing not only of this generation but of future generations are vitally bound up in what we do now, and in what we do with this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had enough lip service to this whole question of protecting the environment and the need for conservation. We have had enough seminars, pamphlets and discussions.  We have inherited a favourable situation so far as our environment is concerned.  Our <Col N="2210" /> common resources of air, water and land are priceless capital assets and they come to us in very good shape. They come to us in abundance.  I fear we shall be like a profligate who inherits some vast fortune. The very fact that the fortune he inherits seems limitless, is in itself a temptation for him to squander it.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for any of us as we drive through Kerry or Connemara or Donegal to visualise that this environment which has been entrusted to us can be seriously damaged; it seems impossible when you look at the vast, almost limitless, beauty which has been handed down to us.  Those of us who make a study of these matters realise that it is very much on the surface and that we are at a critical point at this time.  If we want to ensure that this generation and future generations will be able to live in a pleasant, peaceful environment, the question of the protection of the environment must become a matter of practical everyday politics.  It will not preserve itself.</P>
    <P>Modern economic development, which is based on technology, dictates a need for us to have a positive, active approach to this.  We must have an environmental policy.  That policy must be somebody's responsibility.  Nobody can argue that we have satisfactory administrative arrangements where environmental affairs are concerned. We have a haphazard, unco-ordinated situation.  There is a variety of bodies, institutions and agencies involved in this field, bodies and agencies which either have functions in regard to the environment or whose activities impinge on the environment.  There is an urgent, compelling need to establish some central authority, or at least to have areas of authority defined.  I cannot understand the reluctance of the Minister to undertake this responsibility, which I am seeking to impose on him by statute in this amendment.</P>
    <P>I will just give one simple illustration of the illogicality of the present situation.  The Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities recently had occasion <Col N="2211" /> to examine an EEC directive dealing with the situation in regard to the quality of the water in which people bathe.  We on the committee carried out a thorough and exhausive examination of this directive and its implications for this country.  We had an authoritative statement from experts in the Minister's Department on the situation.  They gave us a full outline of the situation in this regard in this country, and on the basis of that and other information which was available to us, we issued our report.</P>
    <P>No sooner had we our report issued than some officials of Dublin Corporation, for some reason best known to themselves, rushed into print to say we in the committee had been misinformed about the situation in regard to Dublin Bay.  That is the sort of haphazard and unco-ordinated situation which prevails in this matter of the protection of our environment. We have an authoritative statement from the Minister's Department about the situation as they saw it, and then we have the local authority, which is ostensibly responsible for a particular aspect of the environment, contradicting the report we issued on the basis of the authoritative statement from the Department of Local Government. I do not want to make an issue of that.  I just mention it as an instance of the sort of muddled situation which prevails in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think the arguments the Minister put forward the last time we discussed this stand up to critical examination.  He seemed to be saying that there were a number of other Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries involved in this and that I was seeking to give him power over these other Ministers and their Departments, that he could not accept that situation as it would be absurd.  That is not the position.  Our parliamentary committee which is responsible for local government and environmental matters have investigated this matter and their examination has revealed to them that there are at least 13 Government Departments or sections of Departments which are involved in this area of the environment.  The <Col N="2212" /> very fact that there are so many Government agencies with functions in this area surely dictates that there should be some one central person who has responsibility.  My amendment does not seek to give the Minister any power.  It merely seeks to place on him a statutory responsibility for protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is misconceiving my purpose and the purpose of the amendment when he thinks I am seeking to give him powers over these other sections of Departments.  The other Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries would naturally continue to carry out their own functions and exercise the powers delegated to them by the Oireachtas.  The Minister would have an overall responsibility to see that in carrying out these duties and obligations they had regard to the protection of the environment.  I am not asking the Minister for Local Government to assume Ministerial powers which rightly belong to other Ministers.  I am asking him to assume responsibility as a central authority to ensure that in the discharge of their duties they consider what impact what they are doing will have on the environment.</P>
    <P>There is nothing unique about this in our Administration.  What I am proposing already exists in several areas.  Any Minister who comes forward with a proposal must, under the existing rules, consult all other Government Departments who might have an interest in what he is doing or proposes to do or whose areas of responsibility might impinge on what he is proposing to do.</P>
    <P>The system of Government we practise at the moment is that a Minister who wishes to make some new proposal circulates that proposal to all the other Government Departments who might conceivably be interested. They express their views on what this Minister is proposing from the point of view of their particular responsibility. It works very well.  If the Minister for Local Government decides to do something which would impinge on the activities of the Department of Justice, he must circulate his proposal to the Department of Justice <Col N="2213" /> in accordance with the normal Cabinet rules and procedures, and the Department of Justice will give a view on what he proposes in the light of their particular responsibility.  I want to create a situation where the Minister for Local Government will have a particular responsibility for environmental matters and any Department or Government agency which is proposing to do or doing anything that affects the environment will have to have regard to his responsibility. There is nothing new or revolutionary in that proposal.</P>
    <P>I just cannot see why the Minister will not accept this responsibility.  He should accept it.  It is necessary that he accepts it.  The situation demands that somebody accepts it and the Minister for Local Government is the most appropriate person to do so. Most of our European neighbours already have a Minister responsible for the environment.  It is the situation in Britain, France, Belgium and most other countries.  It would be ironic if our traditional role in relation to Great Britain was reversed in this generation.  The traditional picture was of a Britain which had been polluted by the industrial revolution and an Ireland which was still beautiful, calm and serene, that if we did not have the advantages of the industrial revolution, we had the compensation of an environment which was intact and preserved.  But, as matters are developing those roles will be reversed.  In Britain, the Ministry of the Environment is doing wonderful work in this field.  We are doing nothing.  If you take two of the principal rivers, the Thames has been completely restored; the fish life and wild bird life is now re-established there, while our unfortunate Liffey becomes more and more polluted every day.  It would be the irony of this generation that our environment steadily deteriorated while Great Britain's steadily improved in this regard.  That is the sort of situation to which I want to direct the Minister's attention.  I am asking him to take responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>I just want to mention another aspect of it, namely, that it will become even more urgent than it has <Col N="2214" /> been up to now because offshore oil exploration and mining are going to become increasingly important in our economic development.  We hope they are going to make an increasingly significant contribution to our material prosperity.</P>
    <P>It is also possible that they will make a contribution to the pollution of our environment unless we do something about it, and I want to see one Minister of the Government given central responsibility.  I want to see an overall national environmental policy with one Minister responsible for formulating that policy and executing it.  The most appropriate Minister in this regard should be the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>That does not mean he will supplant the Minister for Lands.  The Minister for Lands, as we all know, has a responsibility for wildlife and he has a very good piece of legislation coming before this House shortly in that area.  That is not at all inconsistent with what I am proposing.  The Minister for Local Government would have overall governmental responsibility for the environment and in that particular sector of the environment he would delegate that responsibility to the Minister for Lands.  In another area it would be recognised that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance would have the responsibility. The overall central responsibility would be in the Minister for Local Government's hands.</P>
    <P>With all the emphasis at my command I want to convey to the Minister the sense of urgency I feel about this matter.  I think it is something of major importance.  It is probably important to some people that a new office block in Dublin city has a neoGeorgian phoney facade, but I think planning should be concerned with the things that are more fundamental and lasting, with our natural environment, with our fields and streams, lakes, rivers, mountains and beaches.  I think that is what real planning should concern itself with and the preservation of these things for this generation and future generations.  I am asking the Minister to take this responsibility into his own hands because somebody must <Col N="2215" /> take it, and somebody must take it soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would give credit to Deputy Haughey that I am quite sure he is sincere in what he is saying and he believes that what he is saying is needed.  I would point out to him that it is not needed.  He has made a number of comments that would give the impression to anyone who did not know the facts that we have abandoned any attempt to protect the environment. Nothing could be further from the truth.  In fact, the very opposite is the case.  The Deputy quoted the Thames and I would like to quote the Ennel in Mullingar.  He said nobody seemed to be taking any interest, that this was something that was completely left to work out its own salvation.  He spoke about rivers and lakes.</P>
      <P>I am also rather amused at the attitudes and arguments of some people who talk about environment as if it just referred to the little points which they are interested in and it did not cover the very, very wide field which it does cover.  One of the biggest troubles in this country was that there was far too little money made available for the disposal of sewage effluent from towns.  The result was that many rivers and lakes were spoiled.  The Brosna in Mullingar is one example of this.  Because the necessary money was made available to provide a good sewerage system there I understand it is recovering and probably should be back to normal within the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many other towns we have done similar work and provided the necessary money but the biggest trouble is that some people tend to try to use specific arguments which do not really apply in a case like this.  Deputy Haughey referred to the fact that other countries have set up Departments of the Environment and that is quite true. It has been done in the United Kingdom and more recently in Norway. Here is where the rub comes in.  Their functions are entirely different.  The British department have a massive range covering housing, construction, local government and development, transport industries including ports. <Col N="2216" /> The Norwegian department have responsibility for regional planning, pollution problems, nature conservation, recreation and appropriate information services and nothing more.</P>
    <P>In this country the Department of Local Government are responsible for planning and environment at the present time.  As Deputy Haughey so rightly pointed out, if something is being done which is likely to affect another Department the matter must be discussed between the Ministers concerned at Cabinet level.  Therefore, what he is asking for here is already there&mdash;the overall right to recommend. He said, and it rather contradicts the first part of his amendment, that he did not suggest I should have responsibility to override the Minister for Lands or any other Minister on these matters.  His amendment said:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Minister to protect and preserve the natural environment of Ireland.</P>
    <P>If that is so what he is saying is that even if other Minister do not want to do things it should be the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government to insist that they are done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to the arguments made by Deputy Haughey. We have set up the group looking after the water pollution and they are at present doing excellent work.  There has been set up an inter-Departmental committee with particular responsibility for co-ordinating the activities of other Departments where necessary. This committee are also assisting in the development and evolution of policy in this area and they are responsible to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something which possibly could have been done long years ago. It was not done but this Government have done it.  Therefore, I think it is unfair of Deputy Haughey&mdash;maybe he does not mean it that way&mdash;to say that nothing is being done.  He said too much lip-service was being paid to it.  As far as I am concerned the only lip-service I am paying to it is that when I say something should be <Col N="2217" /> done I take the necessary steps to have that done.  There are three different fields.  One is the water pollution, the second is air pollution and third I believe concerns noise.  In those three fields we are attempting to ensure that the position will improve.</P>
    <P>If I thought it would be of help in doing what we want to do then I would willingly accept the amendment. I have accepted numerous amendments already, but this I believe would simply make a big Bill bigger and would not have the desired effect. I want to assure Deputy Haughey that as long as I am here, and I am quite sure that whoever follows me will do the same, I appreciate the necessity to protect our environment and will ensure that that environment is protected.  It is not necessary to accept that amendment for the purpose of carrying out that protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great need for a co-ordinator in relation to environmental matters, and the ideal person to co-ordinate all these activities is the Minister for Local Government. We should remember that there are 13 agencies at present here dealing with the environment and many of them are State Departments.  There is the Department of Local Government dealing with aspects relating to the environment.  There are the local authorities, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Transport and Power, the Department of Health, the Department of Finance, the Department of Lands, the Office of Public Works, An Foras Forbartha, An Foras Talúntais, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and finally the Industrial Development Authority.  I know that it would be impossible to put all those together into one section in the Department of Local Government but certainly something could be done to co-ordinate the activities of these <Col N="2218" /> organisations in relation to the protection and preservation of the environment.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of a single national co-ordinating authority charged with overall responsibility.  There is no special machinery at national level for effective co-ordination between the various Departments and other agencies involved.  The problem is that possibly the major polluters are the local authorities and, therefore, it is difficult to enforce the law against private offenders.  This is a fairly serious statement but I believe it is true.  Local authority areas do not coincide with river basins and, therefore, they have no effective arrangement to overcome difficulties.  For example, I understand that there are approximately 26 authorities involved as far as the River Barrow is concerned. We must bear in mind the fact that the River Liffey flows through three counties and through urban district areas as well.  Therefore, there is a definite need for a co-ordinator.  I agree 100 per cent with this amendment.  I think that the Minister should accept it.</P>

      <P>Far be it from me to prevent the Deputy from saying anything. If Deputy Haughey has other things to say I would be glad if he would say them.  Deputy John O'Leary listed a number of boards which he said were affected in various ways.  With the exception of the IDA, they and many more which he has not mentioned, are in operation.  Most of them are under the aegis of the Department of Local Government. This co-ordinates the bodies which I have referred to earlier in reply to Deputy Haughey and it represents all those which are at present trying to work out something to deal with it. Again I repeat that we are now doing something about sewerage.  I quite agree that the local authorities were perhaps the biggest offenders and we <Col N="2219" /> are now attempting to remedy that. With regard to the question of the number of local authorities in the areas into which rivers flow, we have got a committee set up&mdash;the Water Advisory Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 91:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 53 and 54, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the insertion of the following new section before section 43:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;42A (1)  If it appears to a planning authority, after consultation with the prescribed authorities, that it is expedient to make provision for the prevention of the pollution of any coastal waters, estuary, river, lake or inland waterway they may make an order prohibiting (subject to any exemptions for which provision may be made by the order) the pollution of such coastal waters, estuary, river, lake or inland waterway.</P>
      <P>(2) Every order made by a planning authority under this section may make provision as respects all, or as respects any one or more, causes of pollution in any specified area.</P>
      <P>(3) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing a planning authority shall, in particular, have responsibility for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the control of discharge to and abstractions from coastal waters, estuaries, rivers, lakes and inland waterways in or adjoining their areas;</P>
      <P>(b) the monitoring of such discharges and abstractions; and</P>
      <P>(c) the regular and systematic sampling of the water in all such coastal waters, estuaries, rivers lakes and inland waterways.</P>
      <P>(4)  Any person who&mdash;</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>(a) fails to comply with the provisions of an order under subsection (I), or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) knowingly assists or permits <Col N="2223" /> another person in the non-com-pliance of such an order,</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
    <P>(5) Where a person is convicted of an offence under this section and there is a continuation by him of the offence after conviction he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than £100 for each day on which the offence is so continued or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to give certain powers to planning authorities in connection with water.  It seeks to bring about the situation in so far as our coastal waters, estuaries, rivers, lakes and inland waterways are concerned that there will be some control exercised over them by planning authorities. I do not think anybody would regard the present situation as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I suppose we have been fortunate in this country in so far as our waterways in general are concerned.  They have been, by reason of historic circumstances, comparatively free of pollution. It can be generally admitted that in a decade or so that situation has changed rapidly.  As I mentioned in connection with the previous amendment, economic development in itself brings very real dangers in its train.  It is urgently necessary that we act now to ensure that the comparatively fortunate situation which has prevailed up to now is maintained in the future.</P>
    <P>Since I put down this amendment the situation has changed.  The Minister has indicated that he has in the course of preparation a comprehensive piece of legislation to govern this whole area.  If that is so it is very welcome news indeed Pending the introduction of that legislation I want to seek to persuade the Minister to confer these powers, and indeed this obligation, on planning authorities.  It would be widely admitted that the record of the Government in regard to legislation is not a particularly <Col N="2224" /> happy or satisfactory one.  While the Minister may indicate to us that he is anxious to get on with the piece of legislation governing the whole area of water I do not think that those of us who are interested in this subject can accept that situation with any degree of equanimity.  In the erratic way in which this Government are behaving in regard to legislation in general, I do not think we can have any certainty or any assurance that this very necessary piece of legislation will see the light of day within the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>At least, we have this Planning Bill now getting towards its final Stages in so far as this House is concerned.  The Minister would be wise to give planning authorities these powers if only on an <i>ad interim</i> basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister would agree that the situation is a real one and that it is an urgent one, that action is urgently necessary and that the planning authorities at present have not the necessary power.  Indeed, many of them may not have the necessary inclination to come to grips with the situation in regard to the waterways in their various areas.</P>
    <P>The amendment is self-explanatory. It does not purport to be in any way comprehensive but my intention and my object in putting it down was to endeavour to cope with the situation <i>pro tem.</i></P>
    <P>I would be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the legislation which is in the course of preparation.  I hope he will be able to tell us that we will see it very soon. Also, he should give us some indication as to when he hopes to have it before the House and have it enacted. As I said in regard to amendment 19 when talking about the situation in general, the situation in regard to water is urgent.  I read recently that a recent survey in the United States has demonstrated that it is increasingly difficult for urban dwellers in the United States to drink non-polluted water.  The survey showed that even bottled water contains traces of human sewage as well as unacceptably high levels of heavy metals.  That is a very frightening situation.  It is a <Col N="2225" /> situation which obtains in the United States at this moment.  That is the situation disclosed by a factual survey. We are a long way from that sort of situation in this country but it is something about which we cannot be complacent.  We have a fair amount of polluted water in the country and unfortunately the amount is increasing.  The situation is deteriorating. It is not getting any better. There is need for action.  Again we would be negligent if we did not take steps now to protect the reasonably favourable situation which we have and to ensure that it is not allowed deteriorate, and more important than that, in so far as there is any degree of pollution that the situation is restored as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>I am putting forward this amendment as a very preliminary step.  I know the Minister will say that my amendment is not necessary because he has this legislation on the way but I suggest to him that it would be advisable while waiting on the major legislation to take this preliminary step and give the planning authorities the powers that I have set out in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Haughey in the amendment he has put down.  It is fair to say that we are all, on both sides of the House, very concerned about water pollution.  In more highly industrialised countries the situation has almost gone out of control.  As Deputy Haughey has mentioned, the position in America at present is particularly bad.  The problems they face will be difficult to overcome.  It is true to say that we are fortunate in this country that we have not yet experienced the very severe problems which relate to water pollution.  Tests which were carried out here show that the overall level is becoming worse.  It is not all that significant at the moment but as Deputy Haughey has said it is becoming worse.  It is not sufficient to look at the overall position and talk about the percentage pollution in all of our waters.  We must concern ourselves with the very serious problems which arise in relation to certain stretches <Col N="2226" /> of our rivers particularly those which pass through cities and towns. We all know that these problems are becoming worse and that unless we actively concern ourselves with the situation we will face a position which will be very difficult to overcome.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, we are lucky that we have not yet reached the situation obtaining in many other countries.  As Deputy Haughey mentioned when speaking on amendment No. 90, now that we are on the verge of considerable expansion in mining our problems will increase. Again, the Minister may possibly say that legislation is prepared and is ready to come before the Dáil.  I would like him to give us some idea of when it is likely to come before the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when speaking on the previous amendment, gave one to understand that nothing was done on the whole question of the environment and pollution until he took office.  This is not in accordance with the facts.  A very considerable amount was done by the previous Government and he is continuing their work.  But even all the work that has been done by everybody concerned is not yet sufficient by any means to deal with this very difficult problem.  I suggest that the Minister adopt the proposal put forward by Deputy Haughey even on an interim basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  We are fortunate because we can learn from the mistakes made by other countries.  We have a few water pollution problems which must be tackled.  It is very serious where untreated effluent is allowed enter the sea, particularly near piers and harbours, and, even more serious, in places where people go swimming.  This matter should get special attention in any proposed legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indiscriminate dumping into tidal waters is also an extremely serious matter.  We know that EEC and other international regulations are becoming so strict in relation to the provision of water anti-pollution <Col N="2227" /> measures that it is now a serious offence to allow even sheep dip into tidal waters or into the sea.  Penalties are not severe enough as far as polluters are concerned, and in any proposed legislation they should be substantially increased.</P>
    <P>So far as indiscriminate dumping and throwing of litter is concerned, the gardaí should be empowered to take action.  It should not be left to local authorities and planning authorities alone to take action.  Most of the officials of these authorities work a five-day week, but garda patrol cars could move around at any time. If they should be empowered to take action against people who are guilty of indiscriminate dumping and of scattering litter all around, and if the penalties were severe enough, that would go a good way towards preventing these things happening.  If this amendment were accepted it would be an indication of the interest which the Government have in water pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support this amendment.  Even since this Bill was first published things have changed very much.  It is no reflection on anybody that we have not been doing the things we should have been doing.  We cannot disturb the seabed, which has been there for millions of years, without nature hitting back in some way. Local authorities would need additional powers to cope with the new situation.  There has been extensive development in land exploration in the Minister's own constituency and to some degree the rivers have been affected.  There are bound to be side effects, and local authorities should have additional powers to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because we are an island adds to our problems.  Perhaps the Minister could see his way to reiuvenating or improving the coast watching service. In its early days this service had the duty of watching for invaders.  Now they should be employed to make people aware of the necessity to keep our waters clean.  We should recruit, even on a voluntary basis, people from the maritime areas who would help in <Col N="2228" /> this.  There is a need to involve all the people in being so watchful that we will ensure that our waterways and the sea be as clear as they can be.</P>
    <P>Some years ago some Members of the House and myself visited the Baltic Sea which was severely polluted.  The Danes blamed the cities further north for pouring untreated sewage into the Baltic Sea.  But we can take hope from the fact that for many years past plans have been prepared for the great Dodder Valley drainage scheme, the canal scheme and a new sewage treatment plant at the Pigeon House.  These will ensure that there is an improvement in the Liffey and its tributaries in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey mentioned what the Port of London Authority had done for the Thames.  By a great miracle they have restored marine life to this river, but at enormous cost. We can save ourselves considerable costs by adopting this amendment, which will save millions of pounds on remedial measures.  It would be much cheaper to prevent the situation developing. I hope the Minister will decide to accept the principle of this amendment.  We expect that mineral exploration will improve our economy. We welcome this, but we do not want to create the situation where we may become materially rich but aesthetically poor by allowing despoliation of the natural scene.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to hear some of the things that were said here this evening.  I thought we were going to have a nice, little, smooth easy run with the Bill and that only matters under discussion would be dealt with. But Deputy Haughey wants to talk about the programme of the Government with regard to legislation.  The Government's programme is by far superior to anything the previous Government or any other Government ever brought in.  The only reason we are having difficulty with the Bill is because of the tactics used, not by Deputy Haughey, but by some of his colleagues, and he knows this.  It is a pity that Deputy Haughey should have introduced that note.  If he wants to put something on the record let us have it on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2229" /> Deputy Faulkner and Deputy John O'Leary talked about the local authorities being responsible for effluent going into the sea and all the rest of it.  Of course, that is so and the reason it is so, is not alone because of decades but generations of neglect and particularly neglect in the last 20 to 30 years.  I blame all Governments who are responsible because very little effort has been made until now to try to do anything about providing the necessary sewerage services to towns and cities.</P>
    <P>The amount which is being given this year is three times what it was when I took over.  The Deputies can talk about the effect of inflation and all the rest of it.  I am not satisfied. We would require a massive injection of money to deal with this problem. It is wrong that reasonable, sensible Deputies should get up in this House and try to suggest that matters are getting worse here, because they are not.  The facts are that we are gaining slowly, I admit very slowly, but we are gaining ground.  It is only fair that we should say this.</P>
    <P>I was interested when Deputy Seán Moore got up.  I thought he was going to make a comment on the comments which Deputy Haughey made on the previous amendment in regard to whether or not Dublin Corporation were right or Deputy Haughey's committee were right about the state of the waters for bathing around Dublin.  Deputies should not forget this.  The situation is that the waters are safe for bathing.  What Deputy Haughey's committee found was that they were not up to the top standard but what Dublin Corporation said was that it is safe for bathers and there is no health hazard involved.  In fairness to Dublin Corporation and to Deputy Moore who is a member of the corporation, I think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If it goes out of here that our waters are not up to standard and that there is a danger, it can have an effect on tourism. I am sure Deputy Haughey does not mean that.

It is a very damaging statement to make here in this House.  I would like if this matter was fully considered by Deputy Haughey because I am quite sure he does not intend to do the damage which the statement he has just made can have.  There is no health hazard in swimming and bathing in the waters off Dublin Bay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling Deputy Haughey that.  I am sure he will accept that when I say something is the truth it is the truth.  The next thing we come to is the question of the control of water pollution.  It is a very complex problem.  A detailed study was carried out by the interdepartmental working group, who published a report on a very important day, the 13th March, 1973.  Where it had been before that I do not know, but it suddenly appeared on the 13th March, 1973.  Observations were asked for and were furnished by various interested bodies on the working group's recommendation and comprehensive legislation to provide for better control of water pollution is at present being drafted.  I was asked the question when will it be ready. It is almost completely drafted and I am hopeful that within the first few weeks of the next session we will have this legislation before the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to what the powers of planning authorities are, they have very wide powers.  One thing that really riles me is the fact that I hear people talking, particularly representatives of planning authorities, as if they had not got those powers.  They have got very wide powers to control discharges from all new developments requiring planning permission and arrangements are being made in the Bill before the House to ensure more effective use of this power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the existing position where effluent is coming in?  The position is that under the 1963 Act, section 37 gives power to require the discontinuance of use where pollution <Col N="2232" /> is being caused.  That power is there and in section 32, paragraph (f), of the present Bill before the House we are putting in extra powers by an amendment which will strengthen the powers of planning authorities to combat pollution by relieving them generally of liability for compensation where they impose conditions for the purpose of securing avoidance or reduction of serious air or water pollution.</P>
    <P>I know that the Opposition are as anxious as we are to ensure that the position is improved but we must do it in an orderly way.  With regard to the question of drinking water, we have absolutely no difficulty in meeting EEC requirements.  Deputy Haughey will forgive me if I comment on the fact that it was rather interesting that the example which he got was in New York.  He did not quote any example here because there is no example of pollution in drinking water in this country, thank God, and there will not be.  As far as we are concerned we are improving the situation. If there is anything to be said I think it should be said here during this debate.  I want to state that we have no difficulty meeting the EEC regulations in regard to the standard of drinking water.</P>

      <P>We have no problem, but surely to God nobody would say a person should go out and drink the water out of the street.  If there is a break in the main and there is some type of water coming into it, which is polluted temporarily, surely nobody can say that that is the standard in this country.  We are all too anxious <Col N="2233" /> to knock what we have.  What we have is good.</P>

      <P>On old pumps down the country occasionally one may see a notice: &ldquo;Boil water before drinking.&rdquo; That is when a pump has gone right down to the very bottom, there is a very low depth of water in it and it is actually sucking mud.  The notice refers to cases like that but that is not the generality.  We have no difficulty in regard to the normal public water supply.</P>
      <P>Since we will be introducing the new legislation in the next session I would ask Deputy Haughey to withdraw this amendment.</P>
      <P>The local authorities and planning authorities have the powers if they would only use them.  But many of them seem to be taking it very easy. They talk about powers but will not use them.  If they are not prepared to use them there is no point giving them extra powers.  I ask Deputy Haughey to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say, to have the Minister make accusations about knocking this country in so far as I and most of my colleagues on this side of the House are concerned is straining credulity a bit because our whole contribution to public life has been in the opposite direction.  However, in the thrust and parry of debate we say things that, perhaps, on reflection we might not say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that any objective observer could suggest that, in putting down this amendment, I am in any way making any contribution to knocking this country.  I am seeking to give new powers to planning authorities which the Minister himself admits he will give them later on by way of legislation.  The Minister went to some lengths to indicate that my amendment was not necessary.  If it is not necessary, why is he bringing in <Col N="2234" /> this comprehensive piece of legislation, if all is well with regard to water?</P>
    <P>It is quite absurd to suggest we have no problem with regard to water. We have many problems with regard to water and the Minister is foolish in endeavouring to suggest that all is well.  I have personal experience of a small stream in County Dublin which is polluted and about which I was completely unable to get any action taken by any authority to cure the pollution.  There is no point deluding ourselves about these matters. We are not knocking the country in directing attention to the reality of the situation.  The situation in regard to water is still reasonably satisfactory but my argument is that it will not remain satisfactory.  It is deteriorating.  If the Minister does not recognise it, at least his Department recognises that there is need for action.  The Minister says he will legislate, and I am suggesting that, pending the major legislation which is on its way and which is needed, we make this temporary proviso.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to the subject of Dublin Bay.  To some extent it is an irrelevancy in this context, but I want to place on the record of the House, and Deputies opposite know that what I am saying is truthful and accurate, that the Joint Committee on EEC legislation behaved and acted in a most responsible fashion in dealing with the EEC Directive it had before it for consideration.  We sought the best possible advice we could get from the Minister's Department.  We got a straightforward, factual outline of the situation in regard to the EEC Directive from the Department.  That explanation was that, on the whole, this Directive would cause us no problem.  There were two areas in Dublin Bay which would cause us problems.  We, as a committee, did nothing more or less than report accurately on the basis of that expert opinion submitted to us by the Minister's Department.  The fact that Dublin Corporation were naive enough to react in an ill-judged manner to our report should not take from the value of that report.  Dublin Corporation in some outbreak of <Col N="2235" /> sensitivity proceeded to rebut an accusation that we, as a committee, had not made.  We directed attention to the two areas in Dublin Bay where the waters used for bathing did not come up to the standard prescribed by the EEC.  We did that on the basis of responsible expert evidence submitted to us by the Department, and Dublin Corporation did themselves no good by this hasty reaction on their part.</P>
    <P>We were not concerned whether Dublin Bay was or was not a health hazard from the point of view of swimming.  I have my own view about that.  I have no expert opinion to tell me that it is or is not a health hazard from the point of view of people swimming in Dublin Bay.  People who know Dublin Bay have their own opinion as to whether or not it is a suitable place to swim.  Members of our committee had their own individual opinions about the situation. We did not advert to that.  We stated factually what we were aware of on the basis of expert opinion given to us. The Minister has sought to accuse me of doing some harm to the tourist trade because of some implication in regard to the health hazards in Dublin Bay.  I made no accusations about the health situation in regard to Dublin Bay swimming because I do not know whether it is or is not safe and, if the Minister gives me some expert opinion on it, I will accept it.  There are Deputies opposite who know that the Joint Committee acted fully and responsibly in that matter and I think Dublin Corporation were quite silly in rushing into print the way they did. Every Deputy in the House knows that in different parts of the country we have problems in regard to water, be it drinking water or some other sort of water.  As I said, I personally know of a stream that was polluted and, under the existing administrative structures, there was no way in which I could get that pollution attended to or dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it because the Deputy could not find the source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that there were three separate identifiable sources of pollution and I, as a citizen, could not get any action taken.  That stream is still polluted.  The Minister's Department know about it because I have given them the facts.  I could be giving the facts to Dublin County Council and to the Department until the cows come home and the stream would still remain polluted.  That is the situation.  The Minister does not do himself or the House any good by entering into an unrealistic argument about the situation.  The reality of the situation is there.  There are pollution problems.  We hope the Minister will deal with them in this legislation and when it is introduced we will do our best to make it effective and worth while.  The sooner it comes the better. In the meantime the Minister should not be reacting in the way he is to this simple proposal of mine.  This is a well-meant proposal.  It simply seeks interim action to deal with a situation and the amendment was put down a long time ago before there was any talk of the Minister's legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason why I am suggesting to the Deputy that he withdraw it.  I am not quarrelling with the Deputy because he put down the amendment.  I give him credit for it because he put it down in good faith. I wish to make it clear that on more than one occasion I put it on record that it is a recognised fact that approximately 7 per cent of our water is polluted.  Our drinking water is not polluted.  It is up to the highest EEC standard.  There is no evidence that there is unsafe bathing.  The fact that there is effluent in Dublin Bay and elsewhere does not mean they are unsafe to bathe in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will accept that Deputy Haughey and his committee had no intention of knocking the country or the tourist industry when they made a statement which they considered to be a statement of fact.  Perhaps it was unfortunate that this was made in <Col N="2237" /> such a way that it got the sort of publicity which could do harm. Dublin Corporation he said, reacted in the wrong way: they felt harm was being done and they immediately jumped into the breach and said: &ldquo;We are satisfied that there is no danger in bathing in Dublin Bay&rdquo;.  I think we should leave it at that.</P>
    <P>What I am saying with regard to the amendment is that first of all we have got the Bill almost ready.  Early in the next session we will be putting it before the House.  Secondly, there are safeguards there.  I am surprised at Deputy Haughey saying that he was not able to take any action against somebody who was polluting a stream.  I am sure he could have taken legal action if he wanted to. The failure of Dublin County Council to take the necessary action is the sort of thing for which I am putting the additional strength in section 32 (f) of the Bill.  I am doing that because I am aware that in many cases where action could have been taken that action has not been taken by local authorities.  It is as simple as that.  We have the arrangements made and in a relatively short time we should have the legislation here, and I am sure it will go through the House quickly.  I ask the Deputy again to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 92:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 3, to delete &ldquo;in the interests of amenity&rdquo; and to delete all words from and including &ldquo;to&rdquo; in line 5 down to and including &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in line 8.</P>
      <P>This is a non-controversial amendment. I put down this amendment for a number of reasons, but principally because I am a bit confused about what the Minister is at in the change he is purporting to make by section 31 in which he proposes to amend the principal Act by substituting new subsections for the existing subsection (1) of section 42.  The first thing that strikes me about the new subsection (1) which the Minister is going to insert is that in paragraph (a) he now brings in the extra word &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo; to &ldquo;natural beauty.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  It was leading up to what I wished to say.  I am not quite sure what the Minister is at in the amendments to the Principal Act which he is proposing in section 31.  My amendment relates to section 31 of the Bill.  There are so many things involved here that it is difficult to keep them all in mind.  We are dealing with the Principal Act, the Bill and now with amendments to the <Col N="2239" /> Bill which is amending the Principal Act.  It is all very confusing.</P>
      <P>In the Act, section 42 (1) (a) deals with areas of special amenity and the making of special amenity area orders.  Paragraph (a) prescribes that the planning authority, &ldquo;if it appears to them that an area is an area of special amenity by reason of its natural beauty&rdquo; and so forth, may do certain things.  In section 31 in this subsection which the Minister is purporting to insert, he changes that and brings in the qualification &ldquo;outstanding natural beauty&rdquo;.  Does the Minister agree with that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with amendment No. 92, but in order to lead up to that I said that my reason for putting down this amendment is because I am not quite clear what the Minister is at.  He is making changes in the legislation in regard to special amenity area orders.  The first change he makes in section 31 is to bring in the word &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo; whereas the Act merely mentioned &ldquo;natural beauty&rdquo;.  He is changing the circumstances in which a planning authority can bring in a special amenity area order.</P>
      <P>I merely want the Minister, when he comes to deal with my amendment, to explain to the House why he is introducing the new qualification of &ldquo;outstanding natural beauty&rdquo;.  He is restricting planning authorities in the making of special amenity area orders to areas which have outstanding natural beauty whereas before the situation was that they could make them because of their natural beauty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2240" /> I began by saying I do not understand what the Minister is at in the changes he is making.  To come more specifically to my amendment, the Minister in paragraph (b) is substituting a new subsection for the existing subsection (1) of section 46.  Section 46, subsection (1) of the Principal Act reads:</P>
    <P>If it appears to the planning authority, after consultation with the prescribed authorities, that it is expedient in the interests of amenity to make provision for the protection of any rare species of flora or fauna of any area or to preserve from extinction any species of flora or fauna of any area, they may for that purpose make an order with respect to such flora or fauna; and, in particular, provision may be made by way of such order.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to outline what the order may specify.</P>
    <P>In the new subsection (1) which the Minister proposes to insert he, first of all, restricts the making of these areas to an area which is either a whole area or part of an area to which a special amenity area order relates.  In other words, these conservation orders at the moment can be made for any area where the planning authority wish to provide for the protection of rare species of flora or fauna.  But in the new subsection, the making of these conservation orders will be restricted to special amenity area orders or portion of special amenity area orders.  I want the Minister to explain why he is making that restriction.</P>
    <P>On some occasion earlier on when he was discussing this Bill, the Minister pointed out that no special amenity area orders had ever been made.  If no special amenity area order has ever been made, and he is now going to bring about a situation where conservation orders can only be made for areas about which special amenity area orders have already been made, then he is very largely nullifying any possible effect of section 46.  My amendment is designed to prevent that happening and to revert to the situation which obtains under the Principal Act at <Col N="2241" /> present, namely, that the conservation order can be made for any area where there are special flora or fauna in need of preservation or protection. Perhaps the Minister would say what precisely he has in mind in the changes he is proposing under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this new section 31.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (a) provides for the amendment of section 42 of the 1963 Act, as Deputy Haughey says, which enables an order setting out special control measures to be made for an area which was an area of special amenity by reason of (a) its natural beauty and (b) its scenic or other amenities, including recreational utility.  But here is the catch.</P>
      <P>No special amenity order has yet come into operation.  One was made by Dublin Corporation on 23rd June last.  The reason none came into operation is that the scope was too wide. In 12 years nobody was prepared to bring in a special amenity order because if it was brought in for one place somebody else would say: &ldquo;Is not ours just as good?&rdquo;  You could have all sorts of problems.  The local authorities and planning authorities got out of it by bringing in no special amenity orders good, bad or indifferent.</P>
      <P>It was obvious to me that there was no point in leaving the phraseology as it was because, if I did, it would be useless.  By putting in the words &ldquo;its outstanding natural beauty&rdquo;, it is possible to pick out even small areas of outstanding natural beauty.  I believe most areas of the country are beautiful but there are areas of outstanding natural beauty.  We know where they are and the local authorities know where they are.  They can pick them out and put an order on them.  This is what is going to happen.</P>
      <P>While the Minister for Lands has the responsibility to preserve wildlife and flora and fauna there may be areas under the control of local authorities where they might like to do this, although the Department of Lands might not feel it was necessary. The authority to do it in specific cases should be provided.  That is the answer to the two questions.</P>

A planning authority could, in the interest of amenity, make provisions for the protection of any rare species of flora and fauna in any area and preserve those species from extinction.

      <P>Paragraph (b) provides for amendment to section 46 of the 1963 Act which enables conservation orders to be made for protection of rare flora or fauna.  The section is seldom used because it is difficult to draft a statutory order, difficult to enforce it and the power is defective in that no provision is made for habitat protection.  The Wild Life Bill, at present before the Seanad, deals with these problems, but there may still be areas where planning authorities wish to have a power to conserve flora or fauna for amenity reasons.  The proposal is to simplify the existing provisions considerably and to confine the power to make orders to areas which are subject to special amenity orders under section 42.</P>

      <P>Precisely.  That is exactly what I have been saying.  The Minister has confirmed my point of view.  I have been saying that the existing section 46 of the Principal Act leaves it open to a planning authority to make one of these conservation orders for any area.  The change the Minister now proposes is to restrict the making of these conservation orders to special amenity area orders.  On his own admission, there has only been one special amenity area order made.  If that situation is to continue, that special amenity area orders are going to be very rarely and seldom made, then there will be no conservation orders made.</P>

We are concerned here with planning authorities.  Up to now a planning authority could look at a situation in which there was a special species of flora or fauna in need of protection or preservation. They could make a conservation order for that species for any area under their jurisdiction.  The change the Minister is making is that in future they can only make those conservation orders if a special amenity order is already made.  That is ridiculous, because the Minister has confessed <Col N="2245" /> that because of the machinery involved special amenity area orders have not been made and we have no guarantee they will be made.</P>

He is hoping, by the change he is making, they will be made much more freely in future.  We do not know about that. Why is he restricting conservation orders in this way?  It is possible that there will be a species of flora or fauna in the area of a planning authority for which no special amenity area order has been made.  If no special amenity area order has been made in future the planning authority will not be able to make a conservation order.  That is an absurd situation.

We are concerned with a planning authority having a special regard for particular situations.  Those situations are where it is brought to their attention that somewhere within their planning authority area there is need to make a conservation order for a particular species of flora or fauna.  The Minister cannot deny that such a situation is likely to arise.  We, on this side of the House, believe that the planning authorities should be free to make that conservation order in respect of that particular species of flora or fauna anywhere within their planning authority area.  It is unnecessarily restrictive and it would make the whole thing inoperative if the Minister restricts the making of these conservation orders to areas in which special amenity area orders exist.

Recently Dublin Corporation brought in the first one in 12 years.

Every place in the country is not a place of outstanding natural beauty.  There are areas which are of great beauty but are not outstanding. Therefore, if we put in &ldquo;of outstanding natural beauty&rdquo; this will be recognised and will be used by very many local planning authorities.  It is as simple as that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2249" /> The purpose of this Bill is to enable the establishment of the premium employment programme.  The target I have set in this programme is the return of 10,000 people whose names presently appear on the live register of unemployed to full-time gainful employment.  Further, the objective of the programme is to encourage the re-employment in manufacturing industry of workers who have lost their jobs as a result of the current recession.</P>
    <P>We have relied here in the past almost exclusively on grants for capital expenditure as an aid to industry and for the creation of new jobs.  That strategy has by and large worked successfully. The recent report of the OECD on manpower policy in Ireland questioned the appropriateness of this policy and argued that a &ldquo;scheme of employment premiums, might for a given injection of funds, lead to a greater incentive to increase employment&rdquo;. This is the first active intervention through wage subsidisation in the area of direct job creation.  I will be watching carefully to see if the operation of the scheme adds weight to the argument that our overall incentives for industry might not be more directly related to employment creation.</P>
    <P>It is proposed under the programme that premiums will be payable in respect of full-time employment of persons who (a) were in receipt of unemployment benefit at any time after 20th June, 1974; and were (b) continuously on the live register for not less than four weeks immediately preceding their first employment under this programme or who were (c) attending a training authority course, full-time, immediately preceding their first employment under this programme; or were (d) employed by the same employer on a short-time arrangement in the PAYE week beginning on 15th June, 1975.  Additional employees recruited on a parttime or short-time basis will not be regarded as eligible for the purpose of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I mention these details because the text of the Bill relates mainly to such regulations and rules and I wish to <Col N="2250" /> draw the attention of the Deputies to these items in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The scheme generally applies to manufacturing industry as this sector has been most affected by the current recession.  It will apply to such industries as textiles, footwear and engineering.</P>
    <P>The programme will be administered through the National Manpower Service of my Department and the staff of that service, which has a national network reaching into every county throughout the State, are in contact with employers on the operation of the programme.</P>
    <P>Preliminary information has been made available to interested employers. Already over 200 inquiries have been received at departmental level though this does not include contacts made at local level.</P>
    <P>As might be expected, the largest volume of inquiries so far received came from the textile sector, and we feel that in this industry in particular the scheme can be a significant factor in stimulating the re-employment of workers who have been laid off during the recent recession.</P>
    <P>Inquiries have been received also from employers in such sectors as plastics, footwear and engineering, and other industries affected.</P>
    <P>The amounts of the premiums will be those announced in the budget statement of the 26th June 1975, that is, £12 per week per eligible employee from 29th June, 1975, until 27th March, 1976, and thereafter £6 per week per eligible employee until the termination of the scheme on 26th June, 1976.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made here in the course of debate during the past few weeks that instead of a flatrate system of payment the premium should be based on a proportion of earnings.  The criteria for selection of flat rate rather than percentage payment consisted in our assessment of what was most appropriate to the industries which had suffered severely in the course of the present recession. It has been our experience so far that the industries which have shown most <Col N="2251" /> interest are precisely those for which the scheme was intended to aid, namely, the labour intensive industries.</P>
    <P>There will be no ceiling on the funds available for the premium employment programme.  As I said, the target I am working towards is the return of 10,000 to full-time employment. Tomorrow morning we will be considering the Estimate.  We have a figure for the Estimate and I will be very happy to come back to this House as quickly as possible for authorisation for the disbursement of extra funds to aid this programme because, as I said, there is no ceiling on the fund to be made available to it.  In addition, all employers who see business operations are suited for inclusion in the programme will be contacted.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 3 of the Bill is to enable a decision to be made on the industries and persons to whom the programme will apply.</P>
    <P>Section 4, the heart of the Bill, gives me power to pay premiums to eligible employers.</P>
    <P>Section 5 would give power to require an employer applying for payment under the scheme to provide information both as regards the industry carried on by him and an employee or class of employee in order to enable me to determine whether the scheme applies.  It would also enable me to provide forms for the purpose and generally to provide for the effective administration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 6 gives power to appoint inspectors who would generally have similar powers to those appointed under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.</P>
    <P>Section 7 contains the usual provisions relating to prosecutions and in section 8 there is a standard provision covering expenses.</P>
    <P>I appreciate we have only a limited amount of time for the discussion of this important measure tonight.  I do not wish to monopolise the time of the Opposition Deputies and the Opposition spokesman, who I am sure <Col N="2252" /> wishes to make his usual criticism of this measure, although I think it has been received with a good deal of constructive comments from the Opposition spokesman and other speakers from his party.  I thought it better to outline briefly some of the main features of the Bill and to indicate, as I indicated in the recent budget debate that while employment in general cannot be expected to improve significantly until we see improvement in the position in our main export markets and in the demand situation on the home market.  While these are conditions essential to full recovery in the economy, this present measure is designed to assist.  It is an incentive to industry to get men and women at present unemployed back to work.  It does not take from the importance of that prior condition of recovery in our market and in other markets, but it should certainly assist industry in bringing back needed man power and woman power to help when full recovery takes place.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that the time allotted to this Bill is inadequate because of a guillotine motion in this House on the 9th July. It is unfortunate that a discussion on a subject such as this&mdash;what I believe to be the greatest need within our severely hit and badly governed economy at the present time, this loss of job situation which is creating huge unemployment &mdash;that we should be confined to just one hour on this Stage of the Bill and again an hour on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that a very substantial and allembracing motion was passed through this House on 9th July which makes specific reference to this.  I have not got the Order Paper with me, but I am sure you will recall that on that motion proposed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach he said&mdash;and this is our main criticism of this guillotine motion&mdash;<Col N="2253" /> that there were Bills, and this was one of the most important of them, the debate on which would be confined to two hours.  It is an unfortunate situation.  This is the time of the year which we have become accustomed to call the peak employment period.  I am sorry we cannot say that about 1975.  Not only is this an evil from the economic viewpoint but also because of its effect on the morale of the work force generally and because of disappointment being created about the lack of opportunities for the young people.</P>
      <P>We should be prepared to sit here, even through the month of August if necessary, if by doing so we could achieve something for the work force we are elected to represent. If this Dáil did nothing else but put through a measure that would be effective in seeing the unemployment figures substantially reduced, giving opportunity to people to return to their place of work, it would be to our credit.  These are areas we must be concerned about.  The Minister for Labour and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in addition to the normal economic functions they perform, must have a social regard for people's welfare and the morale of people, in particular the working people, who have been held in a very common place.  If we had to sit through the month of August&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Time is so scarce.  I have no time to answer Deputy Collins either.  He can carry on and make his normal contributions to this House, which are interruptions.</P>
      <P>One can gain some idea of the seriousness of the situation by looking at the unemployment figures and comparing like figures with like figures.  If we compare the figures for the first week in July, 1973, a few months after Fianna Fáil left office, with the figures for the first week in July, 1975, we will find that 36,329 more people were on the live register in July of this year than there were in the same week in 1973.  We will also find that 27,941 more people were in receipt of unemployment benefit than there were in the first week of July, 1973, an increase approximately of 89 per cent.  These figures are startling, but they are something we must concern ourselves with, because we can never hope to see an up-turn in our economy until we can effectively reduce these frightening figures.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse, in regard to the situation for the first week in July we have to add a huge number of school leavers.  This year there is a very large number of school leavers who cannot get employment.  We also have to add the very many industries that unfortunately have closed or will be closing during this month of July. Industries that existed in areas not only for years but for centuries.  These are all figures which will be adding enormously to the unemployment figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I thought this scheme in its present form would produce 10,000 jobs I would laud it wholeheartedly. I would say, of course, that it is not enough because not alone do we want 10,000 jobs but we want 30,000 plus what have been lost.  The position is so serious that there is no point kicking political footballs across this House. I could say that the Minister, when he was in Opposition, was most unkind to Minister in my party.  I would ask them to think for a moment of the sound situation which existed then compared with now.  I would appeal to the Government to <Col N="2255" /> at last act responsibly and to realise that on this side of the House there are people who are and always have been concerned with employment and job creation.  When a measure such as this is brought before the House we should have time to discuss it in detail.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier in my contribution to the budget, I support the Bill in principle, and so does the party in Opposition.  However, before this Bill goes through the House we will have one hour to discuss the Committee Stage.  There are many amendments which have to be put down to this Bill and it is disappointing that we will not have the opportunity of discussing in detail some of these amendments that we think are necessary.</P>
    <P>My first criticism of the Bill is that it gives one the impression of being a hastily prepared document.  That in itself may not be a grave sin in the existing situation, but it also appears to be not well researched.  This is something that cannot be forgiven, because we are aware for a considerable time now that jobs are being lost, that opportunities are not being created.  Therefore this measure should have been well researched long before the 26th June, when it was first announced in this House.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill is that when the Minister for Finance in his budget debate of the 26th June mentioned this premium employment scheme, he gave us a certain amount of detail.  On the day following, the Minister himself came in as promised and we were told we would get full details; eventually we did get some. We have no details whatsoever of the scheme in the Bill.  The Minister is looking for powers.  Personally I am all in favour of giving discretionary powers to a Minister in normal circumstances and would feel that it would be, in a crisis situation, a useful thing to do.  But in regard to legislation of this sort for a temporary period, for a specific period of one year&mdash;we are led to believe this measure will be in force until June next year&mdash;out of mere courtesy to <Col N="2256" /> the Members of this House, both the backbenchers on the Government side as well as the Deputies here, the Minister should spell out in greater detail the conditions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>We have been given some of the details in the speech of the Minister for Finance, in the Minister for Labour's speech.  The National Manpower Service have already compiled provisional conditions, I understand, and again tonight the Minister has added on an extra condition to it.  I want to go through the conditions at a later stage, but before doing that, as I say, I am criticising the fact that the Bill has not spelt out to us in greater detail what is involved in it. It is a framework, a framework to provide the employment premiums, but the opportunity for discussion is denied us.  It is denied because of the time being given to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Having said that, I also want to say that we are being denied the opportunity of adequately discussing this document because the conditions in the Bill have not been spelt out.  It is a shell, a framework.  It does not give us the opportunity for that, nor indeed had we adequate time to do it.  We are entitled to assume that the conditions <Col N="2257" /> are as laid down by the Minister in his statement to the House.  Before dealing with that I want to refer to his statement here tonight and the 10,000 jobs.  I sincerely hope we get 10,000 jobs under this scheme.</P>
      <P>What I am concerned about is the uncertainty, and possibly a lot of it has to be guess work.  We have the supplementary estimates from the Department of Labour.  He said he would be delighted to come back and look for more money.  So indeed would I be delighted to see him come back and look for more money.  But the point I want to make is that in this supplementary estimate a figure of £1,250,000 is mentioned.  That equates to 2,500 jobs.  I am glad to hear the Minister say tonight that there is that improvement already.  I find it hard to understand why so recently we should have been budgeting for 2,500 jobs.  Tonight he comes to the House and tells us we are budgeting for 10,000.  There appears not to be enough research done on this measure, as I said already.</P>
      <P>I want to come to the details of the Bill.  Its title emphasises the narrow scope of the Bill.  We are told that it is an Act to enable the Minister for Labour, by means of a scheme to be known as the Premium and Employment Programme, to make grants available to employers engaged in certain manufacturing industries for the purpose of encouraging employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the Government as sincere as we would like them to be about encouraging employment?  According to this Bill certain manufacturing industries are excluded.  It has not been spelt out for us what these industries are. We are told food processing industries, but we do not know which ones.  But if we take it that all manufacturing industries are provided for, I would again refer to a few figures I have here.  In the period January, 1974, to January, 1975&mdash;unfortunately later figures are not available&mdash;the number of males in insurable employment here was 445,857, of which only 150,249 were in manufacturing industries, a third approximately.  On the female side&mdash;and here our figures are a little bit further back&mdash;from July, 1973, to <Col N="2258" /> July, 1974&mdash;244,584 females were in insurable employment, and of these only 83,497 were employed in manufacturing industry, or again a third or less than a third.  These were the figures at January, 1975, and July, 1974, I am sure everybody in this House will agree with me when I say the ratio is now far worse than 1:3 as regards those employed in manufacturing industry. The point I am trying to make is this, that I believe the Minister has greater scope available to him for providing employment in other fields and other spheres.  We may say&mdash;and he does so in his speech&mdash;that he is devoting his efforts generally to certain weaker areas in manufacturing at the present time.  His reasons for that are sound enough, but in view of the crisis situation we are in, I am saying to him that he is not going far enough.  In service industries like the hotel industry, there is scope for encouraging employment and creating employment and creating jobs.</P>
    <P>If we look at what the £12 is going to cost net to the Exchequer, we will find in fact that the amount given is far less than £12.  If we deduct from that £12 the social welfare stamp contribution of the employer and the employee and if we take it that a number of these people will also be paying income tax back to the State, we will probably find that as a result of the employment being created by the £12 premium £6 of that will be coming back to the State.  As I say £6 will be a considerable figure by way of revenue in the area of finance in income tax and in social welfare contributions.</P>
    <P>For that reason the idea is to extend it to the spheres or areas where it is easier to stimulate jobs and to create employment.  I accept this and I accept the point the Minister makes in his speech about the industries that have been affected.  There is particular interest in them.  What concerns me is whether we are in time where the textile and footwear industries are concerned.  Many jobs have been lost.  Are the order books of the companies that are in trouble gone too far?  Has it been too late?  These are all <Col N="2259" /> questions we must ask ourselves.  I am afraid that in certain areas, for the textile industry particularly it is too late.  It is unfortunate that in my own constituency, for example, we have two industries closing this month. These concerns have been operating for centuries.  This is why I feel that the scope of the Bill should be widened in view of the fact that the Exchequer will not have to pay the full £12 because there will be a certain substantial come-back.</P>
    <P>The idea of providing jobs under this scheme has imagination.  If we look at the cost, we are talking about something like £500 per job.  On the supposition that premium employment has been paid for the nine months to March and for the three months from March to June, I am estimating it at £504.  If we compare it with the cost of providing jobs under the IDA, we will find that this could well be a very cheap scheme indeed.  It can be said possibly that the IDA scheme is a capital investment one, that is of a different nature, that they are permanent jobs.  I hope that at £500 a time these jobs will also be permanent jobs, and that whether the scheme continues in 1975 the jobs so created by it will remain.  If that will be the case £500, by comparison with the IDA jobs, will be a very cheap price to pay.</P>
    <P>This is another reason I would encourage the Minister to accept amendments or to add amendments himself and I promise co-operation with him on the Committee Stage if this is done.  It will all be in the interests of the work force of our country that is so badly hit at present. I understand the IDA cost per job can vary a lot but, on even a very conservative estimate, it would be at least eight times what I reckon to be the cost of providing jobs under this scheme.</P>
    <P>There are embargos or discriminations in the legislation that concern me although I appreciate that there are reasons for them.  There must be a guard against exploitation.  This is essential.  I am concerned about the guideline date of 20th June for the <Col N="2260" /> work force level.  There is at least one firm, a particularly big employer, which closed on that date and which I believe is reopening very shortly.  Are they debarred from participating in this scheme because their work force was at a certain level on 20th June?  I am also concerned about another major industry that is closing during this month although it is hoped it will reopen in three to five months, with a big labour content.  Perhaps there could be the incentive for them to reopen if they could be brought within the scope of the scheme.  I appreciate that there were reasons for the date specified but I would request the Minister on Committee Stage to examine the possibility of extending this date to cater for as many as possible of those firms.  As I am sure everybody is aware, the firms concerned are not trying to exploit the situation or the employment scheme that has been created.  They are in their present situation because the economy has been badly handled by the Government and because of the situation that exists in the country.  If we could encourage them to re-employ, then the extension or the bringing forward of the date of 20th June would again be a worthwhile exercise.  On Committee Stage I would like to spend a day discussing this; there is so much in it.</P>
    <P>I referred to extension of the activities to cover service industries and I mentioned local authorities.  I would prefer to see local authorities assisted in other ways than by this measure but I accept that we could assist both the local authorities to get work done and we could provide jobs by extending it here.  We are aware that the amenity grant schemes have been cut back.  We are aware that the Road Fund grants have been cut back.  We know that there is concern among local authorities about the employment situation.  It would be a good exercise to encourage local authorities to make use of the employment scheme to employ people from the live register; the State would probably be given the money back again.  In addition we would be doing useful work in an area, particularly in the amenity grants sphere, and certain smaller road jobs and repairs could be <Col N="2261" /> effectively carried out if this encouragement were given to local authorities.</P>
    <P>We must tackle positively our unemployment situation.  There is no point in looking elsewhere unless we are prepared ourselves to tackle what are our problems.  There is no point in blaming foreign factors or outside interests. The present situation has been created by this Government but it is there and we must approach it in a positive way.  I believe that if this Bill could get a proper discussion in this House we would put it into shape.  We on this side of the House would help to make the measure far broader and to include many more people.  I am afraid the number of people who can be attracted to manufacturing industry in the present year will not be enough to make an effective impact on the unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>I have been critical before of the way Bills are introduced in this House. Section 3 (1) of this Bill states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determine (and shall specify in the Scheme) the industries or the activities in specified industries to which the Scheme applies and the persons or classes of persons to whom it applies.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, specify in the Scheme industries, activities in specified industries, persons or classes of persons (denoted by reference to any matter or in any manner which he thinks fit) to which the Scheme does not apply.</P>
    <P>These are probably the mechanics of drafting a Bill but to me it seems superfluous.  If the Minister specifies one thing, surely that is adequate; he does not have to not specify it.  Instead of this unnecessary duplication, I would have preferred to see conditions of the scheme laid down.  I do not know if the Minister will be putting down any amendments.  I should like to know if the conditions laid down here are those that will be operative under the Bill. The Minister has told us about unemployment benefit payable after 20th <Col N="2262" /> June, 1974.  The Bill states &ldquo;be continuously on the live register for not less than the four weeks immediately preceding their first employment under this programme&rdquo;.  This is where there is discrimination.  Why is it necessary to have this provision?  If a man becomes unemployed because of a situation over which he himself has no control and he is on the live register for only two days, he has not the same opportunity as a person who has been on the live register for four weeks.  Why the distinction?  Why should there be that embargo on persons who have not been on the live register for four weeks?  This is an unnecessary qualification.</P>
    <P>There is no encouragement for employers to give jobs to young people because they will not get the £12 premium in respect of them.  In the case of a widow who may not have been working previously who may get an opportunity of employment, her prospective employer will not have the incentive of the £12 which might provide her with a job.  These are cases I put to the Minister for his consideration. I do not see any practical reason why a man who is genuinely unemployed should not be re-employed even the following day, if the opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>In a rural area a vacancy could arise in a manufacturing industry and a local unemployed man could be available but because the company would not get the employment premium they might bring in an outsider and deny the local man an opportunity of getting a job near home.  I should like to have an explanation of this provision.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have been given the provision about attendance at the AnCO training centre before.  This is to be commended.  People who have attended courses there are commencing their first employment.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear about (d) which says: &ldquo;employed by the same employer on a short term arrangement in the PAYE week beginning on 15th June, 1975&rdquo;.  Is this to protect a particular situation?  If it is, I am quite satisfied with it.  What about the poor fellow to whom this happens on the week <Col N="2263" /> beginning 22nd June?  We cannot expect the Minister to legislate for every contingency, but he could broaden the scope of the Bill, to bring more people into it, to give the opportunity of creating more jobs where they can be created in the more immediate future in the service field, in industries other than manufacturing. I ask him to look again at the employee situation, to reconsider the dates which may cause hardship.  I would be reluctant to adhere too rigidly to regulations and to be guided completely by specified dates if moving the dates would help to provide jobs.  I would not object to giving the Minister certain latitude within the legislation.  I am disappointed that there is not more meat in the Bill as presented to us.</P>
    <P>Our party when in Government were always concerned about industrial development.  One of the chief concerns of Fianna Fáil was job creation.  Structures at that time were different.  There was a decrease in emigration and job opportunities were increasing, especially for young people.  The capital programme of the IDA was encouraged and developed and employment opportunities were being created throughout the country. For two years now we have seen a setback in industry; in the past 12 months particularly there has been a steep increase in unemployment.  We have given our opinions on this to the House many times.</P>
    <P>The approach indicated by the Bill, imaginative as it is must be seen to be effective from the outset.  I appeal to the Minister very sincerely on behalf of the work force of the country not to confine the provisions of the Bill too much now.  There is no better way of promoting employment than in the service field.  This is why I ask the Minister, if he does not introduce amendments on Committee Stage, to accept amendments from this side of the House.  We would like considerable time to devote to the Committee Stage but that may not be possible at this late stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour <Col N="2264" /> are to be congratulated on this Employment Premium Bill.  It is an excellent and novel idea to introduce an employment premium at the present time.  It is highly desirable and most essential.</P>
      <P>The people who will benefit most from the provisions are those who will be taken from the employment exchanges, people who are in receipt of social welfare benefit, unemployment benefit and so on.  These people are not contributing as they would wish to contribute to the economy of the country.  The employment premium will enable them to assist the economy by being employed.  The £12 premium proposed is a generous contribution towards employment.  It will also have the added advantages that the people on social welfare will be working, paying their income tax and social welfare stamps.  These people will benefit handsomely under this scheme.</P>
      <P>For many years past the IDA have been doing excellent work.  They have provided much needed employment. This idea is desirable because it is a direct injection, a direct payment, a direct incentive to people to obtain jobs and it is going to the people who need it.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour deserve the wholehearted congratulations of the House for bringing in this important Bill.  This gives the unemployed an incentive to come back into employment. It gives a similar incentive to their employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister hoped 10,000 people would be re-employed.  This is to be wholeheartedly welcomed.  It is no harm to mention one of the points that has been discussed at length by the Opposition.  There are 102,000 unemployed.  The Government are not happy with that situation and are doing everything possible to rectify it. We should not forget that when the previous Administration were in power, there were between 70,000 to 75,000 people out of work.  We were not happy with that situation and we are not happy with the present situation. I believe it is incumbent upon all of us to ensure nobody is out of work. This Government are as concerned <Col N="2265" /> about employment as any Member on the far side of the House.  It is time that was realised.  Seventy thousand people out of work is very bad; the same can be said about 100,000 unemployed. It is up to each one to provide employment and this scheme is a step in that direction.  Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned that there was not a flow of people out of this country. There has been up until recent years but that has stopped now.</P>

      <P>There is a recession in Britain and the old safety valve which existed for 20 years is no longer there. This Bill will provide much needed employment.</P>
      <P>A very good and positive point in this Bill is that the Government have stated that there is no ceiling on the amount of funds available for employment. This is most desirable.  The sections that are of interest to me are those dealing with the textile industry. The midlands have been heavily dependent on textiles in the past.  If this scheme will help to maintain employment in the textile industry, it is to be welcomed.  The Acton report on textiles dealt with amalgamation of firms and in its way, this meant that closures would follow.  I was not happy with that report at the time it was issued.  At present our textile industry is going through a difficult period but I believe it will be a valuable industry in the future.  Any steps taken at present to maintain employment in the textile industry will prove to be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment premium scheme is also welcome.  The direct payments towards this scheme will have the effect of encouraging employers to take on people.  Money being channelled into new industries is often not utilised to provide the most beneficial effects.  A Bill of this nature must be limited.  I would have liked this Bill to provide a scheme for direct payment <Col N="2266" /> to people employed in farming.  This would have been a better idea, but I am happy with the Bill as presented before the House this evening.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this in the future.  A very large number of people have been leaving agriculture.  This is a continuing process; approximately 10,000 have left agriculture since 1951.  At the present time&mdash;I have not got the figures&mdash; there are approximately 20,000 farm labourers in this country.  There are also a number of farmers' sons and relatives, who were employed on farms, leaving agriculture.  With incentives they might remain.  That is the point I want the Minister to bear in mind.  If they stay in agriculture they will not be taking jobs that would otherwise be going to people who were not born into agriculture.  The flow of people from agriculture in its own way is filling jobs that would otherwise be taken by industrial workers.  If a scheme could be devised whereby the attraction was there to keep people in agricultural employment there would be more jobs available for people in industry.  It has never been seriously tackled.  This Bill is not sufficient.  It needs a lot of thought.  The Minister should get down to it in the next few months. Such a scheme is highly desirable. Agriculture is highly important and it can, in its own way provide employment for people interested in agriculture and can leave vacancies in industry that would otherwise be filled. I am wholeheartedly in support of this Bill.  It is an excellent Bill.  It is a novel idea and can have most beneficial effects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the employment situation particularly in my own constituency. The Minister says that the greatest number of inquiries was received from the textile, footwear and engineering industries.  The whole economy of County Louth is based on this.  I wish to refer to the date on which the grants are available.  I appreciate that there must be a specific date set from which time industrial firms can benefit under this Bill when it becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister is <Col N="2267" /> as anxious as I am that as many firms as possible will benefit and he will have no objection, within reason, to revising the date.  Problems are constantly arising for many industries and many would benefit by having the date changed.  I suggest, rather than have the 20th June as the specified date, that he would take the date on which the budget was introduced by the Minister for Finance, the 26th June.  I feel that this is a reasonable request. It would assist many industries.  I have a particular interest in this matter.  I am sure the Minister is aware that I have already been in touch with his Department on it.  The change I propose would be of benefit to the industry I have in mind, which has had very rough times recently.  I am convinced that the aid available under the Bill would help to a great extent in assisting the industry to get on its feet again.  It would help to re-employ some of the workers more quickly than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>In a supplementary question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce I asked that every facility should be made available to this industry.  He replied that this was being done.  I mentioned that there was another facility which might be made available.  I had in mind the provisions of this Bill.  The Minister is aware of the circumstances in this case.  They are unusual, and it is rather a fluke that the industry is outside the scope of the Bill as it stands.  The workers and management are very concerned about the situation. The Minister would be making a concrete contribution to the future of the industry if he would accede to the suggestion I am making.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 92:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2268" /> In page 20, line 3, to delete &ldquo;in the interests of amenity&rdquo; and to delete all words from and including &ldquo;to&rdquo; in line 5 down to and including &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in line 8.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Haughey.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very reluctant to incur your displeasure by being in any way repetitive but I feel that the Minister has not, as yet, replied satisfactorily to the argument I have made on the question of making conservation orders.  I want to assure the Minister that I will not labour this point. It seems to me that the change made by him will not improve matters.  I confess that I cannot elucidate from him his reasons for these changes.  I am leaving aside the question of his adding the word &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo; to &ldquo;natural beauty&rdquo;, as a qualification for the making of a special amenity area order.  There is no point in pursuing that any further.  The Minister has given his reasons.  I do not regard them as very adequate reasons but there is no point in arguing further about it.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look at his proposals for conservation orders again.  The situation is simple.  Under the principal Act the planning authority could make a conservation order more or less for any time they thought desirable to do so, for any part of their planning authority area.  When this change is made by the Minister such planning authority will only be able to make a conservation order for a particular species of flora or fauna if a special amenity area order has been made.  As we know, special amenity area orders have not been made up to now.  We have no guarantee that they will be made more frequently in the future.  Therefore, to a large extent, this new provision of the Minister will bring about a situation where conservation orders will not be made by planning authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is valid for the Minister to say that the new Wildlife Bill, introduced by the Minister for Lands, will take care of the situation. It certainly represents a considerable advance and is welcome.  If it is worthwhile leaving the power with planning authorities to make conservation orders then it is worthwhile making sure that <Col N="2269" /> the power to make conservation orders is effective.  Otherwise, it would be better to abolish conservation orders altogether and leave it all to the wildlife legislation.  I do not think that would be satisfactory, and I am sure the Minister would not think so either. No matter what the wildlife legislation provides it is important that planning authorities should have this power to make conservation orders.  If they have the power then it should be effective power.  If this restriction is introduced restricting conservation orders to areas where special amenity area orders have already been made then this is of no value whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is very valid.  I suggest that the Minister consider it.  If my amendment is adopted then the new subsection (1) of section 46 will read as follows:</P>
    <P>If it appears to a planning authority, after consultation with the prescribed authorities, that it is expedient to make provision to preserve from extinction or otherwise to protect any flora or fauna in an area or part of an area they may make an order prohibiting,</P>
    <P>and so on.  In other words, we are just spelling it out quite clearly and simply that, if the planning authority thinks there is a need for one of these conservation orders, it will have the right to make that conservation order irrespective of whether or not there is a special amenity area order already in existence.  You will also notice that I am deleting the words &ldquo;in the interests of amenity&rdquo; even though I admit they existed in the original subsection (1) of section 46.  My only reason for deleting them at this stage is because I do not think they add anything to it.  The Planning authority can decide that it is expedient for any reason not necessarily in the interests of amenity.  I do not think there is much point in pursuing this argument to the point of exhaustion, but I cannot be satisfied that the Minister is improving the situation or that, in any reply that he has given me so far, he advanced any valid reasons for this change that he is making.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Haughey said, there is no point in repeating, and I think one of the faults in having such as we had, a break for an hour is that we tend to start off again from where we were at first and tend to reargue.  I think that would be a pity as we are all so anxious to get this Bill through the House.  The existing legislation, which is wide open for 12 years, had only two such orders made.  One of them is on appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Special amenity, one, and conservation, two.  The conservation one is on appeal to the High Court.  Its landowner has appealed against the decision of the local authority.  As it stands, it is like a certain section of the Road Traffic Act.  Because it created a certain offence of manslaughter, nobody was ever charged because it was too serious an offence.  Nobody wanted to do this sort of thing.  Nobody wanted it used.  What I am trying to do is to make it tight so that people will know exactly what they are dealing with and will, if they consider it is important, deal with it.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Haughey's second point, it is true that at the present time going through the Seanad is a Bill which&mdash;the Opposition did not know this but I knew it&mdash;is going to deal with the question of preservation. The Department of Lands will be dealing with flora and fauna but we felt that that was not enough and that the right should be there with the planning authority, in case that they felt that at national level it would not be dealt with, and there might be a section that they would like to put a special order on so we are leaving the authority there for them.  It is as simple as that.</P>

I want to make this point in favour of Deputy Haughey's amendment and the necessity of keeping the broadest powers possible.  It is not the problem, as it has been the Minister's argument that the invocation so far has been minimal; it is the problem of development and the cost of putting things right.  I am thinking particularly of coastal areas where a real conservation problem can develop.  I am not thinking only of Dublin.  I am thinking of our west coast and so on.  It is very important that the broad powers that Deputy Haughey is talking about should be with the Minister for Local Government as the ultimate here.  Looking to the future and the cost, if things are let go out of control, if there is any delay in having the proper controls now we will pay for it.  I will content myself with saying that in the interests of expedition.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(iv) (b) measures to reduce or prevent the emission of heat, gases or particulate matter into the atmosphere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of our greatest problems today is the emission of fumes into the air. There may be provisions enabling local authorities to take action but there seems to be very little action taken.  An eminent consultant of St. Luke's Hospital has said that there was a greater chance of getting cancer in Grafton Street from the fumes emitted from buses and cars than there was from smoking cigarettes.  More action should be taken in this area.  We have factories burning fuels, in some cases sub-standard fuels, emitting quite a lot of sulphur or other matter into the air and very little, if any, action is taken.  Smokeless zones should be looked at and examined and action should be taken where necessary.  The air we breathe determines to a great degree our health.  I accept that local authorities have certain powers but these powers are not being exercised. When granting permissions certain codes of conduct are laid down but that seems to be the end of it.  The permission is granted and those concerned go ahead and proceed to pollute the atmosphere and very little action is taken.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to look at it and examine it so that something can be done which will ensure clearer air and that factories adhere to the standards laid down.  Stricter codes should be laid down for heavy vehicular traffic which is becoming heavier on the roads.  Every day of the week, as you drive along, you can get a belt of carbon monoxide gas in the window and this is not very healthy.</P>

    <P>&lsquo;5A.  Preservation of plasterwork, staircases, woodwork or other fixtures or features of artistic, historic or architectural interest and forming part of the interior of structures.&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a lengthy amendment entailing the insertion in section 34 of five new paragraphs consisting of various amendments to the 1963 Act.  They relate to only two matters.  One is the preservation of internal features in certain buildings and the point has sometimes been made that, while the 1963 Act enables buildings to be listed for preservation, it exempts internal alterations, <i>vide</i> section 41 (g) of the Act.  Thus no protection could be given to distinctive features of special interest.  Joint committees of a number of voluntary bodies have sought to <Col N="2276" /> have this remedied by an amendment of paragraph 5 of Part IV of the Third Schedule of the 1963 Act to enable a development plan to have objectives for preservation of both the exteriors and interiors of buildings. The matter is not simple and a number of related amendments are also necessary.  A new paragraph (b) amends provision in section 4 of the 1963 Act giving exemptions for internal alterations.  New paragraph (d), the second part of the proposed amendment, applies the provisions of section 21 of the 1963 Act in relation to a special notice which is required at present if a building is listed.  This notice to the owner and occupier will have to be given if either the structure or internal features is or are being listed for preservation.</P>
    <P>New paragraph (h) in the third part of the amendment enables inclusion in a development plan of an objective to secure the preservation of internal fixtures or features of artistic, historic or architectural interest.  This would include things like staircases, plaster work, oak panelling, fireplaces and so on.  While it is difficult to secure effective control over internal features, and there has been some doubt as to the value of the provision, nevertheless there is something to be said for listing certain features and placing some obligation on the owners and occupiers of buildings in which they are located.  Since this is 1975 Architectural Heritage Year, the House might agree that provision should be made on the lines indicated.  That is not the only reason, but it is an additional reason.</P>
    <P>The second matter dealt with in the amendment may appear inappropriate in a Local Government Bill dealing with planning and development. For some years past there has been an expectation that the permissive powers of local authorities would be widened.  This would enable them, if they wished, to do something about the problem of stray or unwanted dogs and cats or assist the voluntary bodies concerned.  As far back as 1965, Dublin Corporation expressed their willingness to subvent the Dublin Dogs and Cats Home but they had no <Col N="2277" /> statutory powers to do so.  During the past year numerous representations have been received from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other interested parties.  Accordingly, it has been decided to take this opportunity to remedy the position.  So new paragraph (b) in part 1 of the amendment is to amend section 14 of the 1963 Act so as to permit assistance to be given to any appropriate body or person. New paragraphs (g) of part 3 is to amend section 77 (2) of the 1963 Act so as to enable a planning authority to provide buildings or structures as homes or shelters for stray or unwanted dogs and cats.</P>

      <P>I am all in favour of endeavouring in so far as possible to preserve worth-while internal features in a building.  In relation to the external features, they are pretty obvious to everybody and therefore it would be relatively easy for a planning authority to decide that a certain control should be exercised.  It is quite a different situation in regard to the internal features because in some instances the external features might not be anything out of the ordinary while the internal features might be out of the ordinary and I would like to know from the Minister how it will be possible to get some information in relation to internal features which are worth preserving?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very good question. Perhaps everybody in this House is aware of certain buildings in which there are features which should be preserved but in regard to which no preservation order and no notice has been served.  It is not going to be perfect.  It could not be because there will be many internal features that should be preserved, and will not be preserved and what we are hoping is that at least some of them will be preserved.  But there will have to be a notice served.  Perhaps it would not be a bad idea for those of us who know of such internal features in building to go to the trouble of bringing them to the notice of the necessary authority so that a notice could be served.</P>

      <P>In this city some of the best ceilings and fireplaces are in houses and buildings owned by the Office of Public Works.  One would like to see these included.  The provisions, for what they are worth, are worth while doing.  In other parts of this legislation the Minister says the work is not worth while doing for all that is involved.  We are, perhaps, inclined to be a bit more forthcoming in that regard than the Minister is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help thinking of a famous occasion in this House when Deputy Joe Brennan was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He was being questioned about whether or not a letter box which had been removed from a wall would be put back.  In his capacity as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he replied to the effect that the letter box could not be resored in its former position in the wall because the wall had since been demolished. <Col N="2279" /> It is very doubtful if it is worth much to make preservation orders for interior features if, at the same time, you do not insist that the structure itself be preserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not follow. Deputy Haughey should understand that already in this city quite a number of ceilings, for instance, have been removed and preserved when the buildings were demolished, and fireplaces too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Public buildings are more important in this context than private buildings to a great extent.  By and large, it is much more important to preserve the structure as a whole rather than to itemise one particular internal feature.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, it interests me also that the Minister is prepared to provide facilities for establishing homes and shelters for stray or unwanted dogs and cats but he is not at the same time prepared to assume responsibility for the preservation of our natural environment. The contrast intrigues me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey would then say that because of the fact that I am not looking after frogs and squirrels and snails, dogs and cats should be allowed to suffer.  I do not follow that line of argument at all.</P>
      <P>As far as public buildings are concerned, I agree, but there is already legislation&mdash;the 1963 Act&mdash;for the purpose of having buildings preserved. What we are afraid of is that people will gut the inside of a building without any reference to features which should be preserved.  Quite frankly, this is an effort which will have to be worked on over the years.  It is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the spirit of the section. On the other hand, I am mildly disappointed that we are not indicating how it is proposed to carry out the preservation in question.  If any of us know of parts of buildings that should be preserved there is a responsibility on us.  I would like to see the matter tightened considerably more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2280" /> In European capitals there are perfect examples, most noticeably in the city of Bruges where there was part preservation.  In some places the gable end of an old building has been married to a more modern structure and staircases have been preserved.  I understand they are more vigilant than we are and it is not left to chance.  I wonder if the Minister visualises the introduction of some scheme whereby that which is worthy of preservation will be preserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tunney is talking about the mechanics of it.  I have just said this is something that will have to be worked on.  We must have it in the Bill now.  If we get it passed and it becomes law, we must devise a way in which we can operate it. It will not be possible to force people to give the evidence which they may have and it would be wrong to do that.  On the other hand, Bruges is a long way off the beaten track but if you take Paris and Rome, which many people have visited, in Rome there is an almost complete preservation order on the older part of the city.  No work of any kind can be done without special permission.  This has boomeranged because certain well-known establishments such as the Colosseum have been falling down.  It was nearly all down before they realised they had overstepped the mark. In Paris recently an order was made that certain buildings must be kept up to standard.  If they are not, if he cannot afford to do it, the owner of the building must dispose of it.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 97:</P>
      <P>Before section 35 to insert a new section as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2281" />&ldquo;35.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall have the authority to list buildings as being of histrical or artistic importance and shall be empowered to publish such lists from time to time.</P>
    <P>(2)  In the case of listed buildings, no structural changes or alterations may be made either to the exterior or the interior of such buildings without prior enquiry by the Board. In the event of permission being granted by the Board for such structural changes or alterations, specific grounds for such permission shall be stated.</P>
    <P>(3)  Such power to list buildings shall be exercised by the Minister in consultation with the local planning authority and such other bodies as he may from time to time determine.</P>
    <P>(4)  If it appears to the Minister that the environs of a listed building are endangered by building construction or other developments, he shall have authority to make such regulations as may be necessary to conserve such environs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have quite a number of buildings of historical and artistic importance. Some of them are listed already but there are quite a number that should be listed so as to ensure that the public know about them.  In many areas there are buildings of historical importance and the information in relation to them is available in the locality.  Very often, outside of that, there is little knowledge of them.  It would be worth while in this respect adopting the proposal put forward by Deputy Molloy.  It is a pity some such section was not inserted in the original Bill because many of the buildings which would have been of historical and, perhaps, artistic importance have now vanished from the scene.  There should be an obligation on the planning authority to ensure that such buildings are not allowed to fall into decay.</P>
    <P>There are buildings which may not be of any great utilitarian value but if they have an intrinsic value we should concern ourselves about them. Some of the buildings Deputy Molloy had in mind housed some of the greatest patriots we had.  They were <Col N="2282" /> allowed to fall into disuse.  If the planning authority concerned themselves about such buildings, they would be preserved for posterity.  It would be a pity to allow them to vanish.  We are very proud of our past history and we should concern ourselves about the physical aspects of that history. Therefore, I would request the Minister to give favourable consideration to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not acceptable.  The new section proposed would transfer to the Minister responsibility for listing buildings of historical or artistic importance and would remove from the planning authorities the present discretion in the matter despite the fact that they would have to shoulder responsibility for any compensation liability which might arise.  A lot of extra power should devolve on the local authorities but this would be the direct opposite.  The authority is there and the power and I would not like to be responsible for taking it from them.  Deputy Faulkner will agree on reflection that this is a matter which would be better left with local authorities rather than have the State taking up the responsibility as suggested here.  Even though there is provision for consultation in the amendment it would be seen as removing a function from the planning authority and contrary to the policy which I have enunciated. It is undesirable that the whole question of preservation of buildings should be dealt with in this way.  I would not be prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I know a house which is listed on a development plan for preservation but it is an idle exercise to list a house under a development plan for preservation.  It does not really go beyond that; there is no follow up; there is no inspection.  Even accepting the Minister's principle of the devolution of this authority and task to the local authority, there is scope for further improvement in respect of the type of building in which we are all interested.  I have gone into this in the case of one or two buildings I know. What happens is that the planning authority, in preparing their development plan, list the buildings of significance and importance in a particular area.  The authority mark them down on their development plan as <Col N="2284" /> being category A or category B, but the matter ends there; there is no follow up.</P>

The cost of putting and keeping in repair some of those buildings which are listed would be astronomical. While we all strive for the ideal, I am trying to ensure that the local authority have the onus to list them. If we agree to provide the money to have them repaired, it would cost an awful lot of money.  If, on the other hand, as soon as a building was listed we tried to force the owner to do that we all know what the result would be.</P>

      <P>My interest would stretch a little beyond single buildings. I would be hoping that we should be concerned with the preservation of dwelling houses.  The Minister for Local Government, more than anybody else, should be concerned about the type of houses we have had here for the last century.  They need not necessarily be special Georgian or Victorian type but houses which would indicate the history of building.  It is a pity that we have not a policy towards the retention of houses.  I am thinking of two houses built in Finglas in my youth.  At that time we were all interested because they were a Swiss idea.  They were built without blocks under a system whereby a form of sacking was first erected and onto the sacking was applied some other material.  I am indicating that as an example.  Across the road from that there is an example of the attractive labourer's cottage type of house.  Our <Col N="2286" /> future generations will be thankful to us, apart from the houses referred to by Deputy Faulkner and the building referred to by Deputy Haughey, if we retain examples of dwelling houses and houses which would indicate the evolution of housing here.  There is no better man than the Minister for Local Government to do this.</P>

      <P>Let me give a very brief answer.  I have encouraged local authorities, particularly Dublin Corporation, to do what Deputy Tunney has said.  If those older houses can be acquired and made habitable by local authorities and those who need houses put into them that is the ideal way, even better than Deputy Haughey's mill.  I would rather see money spent on them.  If they are preserved, they are listed and they cannot be demolished without special permission. Maybe a lot more of those type of houses should be listed but, again, it is a matter for the local authority rather than passing it to central Government.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to understand the purpose of this amendment. It seeks a provision which has been long accepted as standing, for instance, in respect of the Arts Act, 1951, the Opticians Act, 1956, the Industrial Training Act, 1967, and the Higher Education Act, 1971. Bodies set up under these and other Acts have been given the same power to hold and dispose of land normally to provide office premises for themselves. It is not to be suggested that boards would be any less trustworthy than those bodies.  There is a misunderstanding in the thinking behind the proposal and I would ask that the amendment be withdrawn.  Technically, it is defective but that does not arise here as its effect would not appear to be that the board would be authorised not only to acquire and hold but also to dispose of land necessary for the proper functioning of the board.</P>

I am aware that expert advice will be available to the board, but I would hope that if there were some experts on it they would, from their experience and knowledge in their particular professions, be better able to assess the advice that is given.</P>
      <P>However, I do not want to suggest that I want all experts on the board. Some experts are suggested by Deputy Haughey and particularly now that the Minister proposes to have quite a considerable number of members on the board, I am not pressing that all of the members should be professional people, very far from it. I am very anxious that the members would be available and would be fully represented in any decisions that are made.

At the present time we have technical advice in the Department. That technical advice will still be available.  There are some of them who are qualified in those fields.  It is quite possible that people like that could be appointed.  I think it would be a mistake to tie ourselves down now and we then have to introduce people.  A hearing takes place and an architect takes the hearing.  The question arises would it be better for the person appearing if it was the engineer who turned up that day or the lawyer?  You have all sorts of these qualifications being considered and we have requests for individual members to do certain things.  I do not think we should tie ourselves in this way.  I suggest that we leave the number and see if we can get the best possible people to make up the board.</P>

      <P>It would not be possible to have a whole covey of board members travelling around the country for appeals, because we would get only one appeal a day.  What Deputy O'Leary is saying is quite correct. When the decisions are taken the members must come back in, discuss them and make a decision at that level, but the hearing, the process of preparing it, will have to be done at individual level.  The board will not base the decision principally on the report of a Departmental Inspector.  They will base the decision on the inspection and on the report of a member of the board.  Deputy O'Leary is confusing the report and oral hearings.  A report which is made is one thing; the oral hearing is a different thing.  I am talking about oral hearings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On the other hand, I would hope, again in circumstances where the members of this House who are discussing this Bill at the moment do not qualify under these professional heads, that when considering membership of the board he would also bear in mind that there are non-professional people who have views to offer and who are capable of adjudicating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All right, three out of ten.  But what three are they?  Do we have an engineer, an architect, a solicitor or a town planner?  Who are we going to have?  I could list off another half dozen people who would be considered just as qualified and who would feel that if we are going to look for professional people who know the job they should be on it. We are going to try to select the best, and if we are going to have the best selected then we should have as wide a field as possible.  I agree entirely with Deputy Callanan.

Engineers and architects do a good job but men who have no qualifications in these professions are also aware of the value of an amenity.  A <Col N="2295" /> cross-section of the community is absolutely essential.  Deputy O'Leary raised a very important point.  Previously oral hearings involved an official of the Department who reported to the Minister, who made the final decision.  Now the oral hearings will be conducted by a member of the board.  Am I to understand he will come back and put his views before the whole board who then make the decision?  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite correct.  The oral hearing will not in every case be conducted by a member of the board. In minor cases it can be done by an official but the important cases will be done by a member of the board.  In each case it must go back before the full board.  The report of the official who is not a member of the board will then be considered.  that is what Deputy O'Leary was talking about.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 104:</P>
      <P>In page 23, to delete &ldquo;The chairman of the Board&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;The chairmanship of the Board shall be whole-time and where the Government appoints a person who is a former judge of the High Court to be chairman of the Board the following provisions shall apply, namely, he&rdquo; in Article 4.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2296" /> Amendments Nos. 104, 105 and 119 are all consequential of the provision of the new section 4 instead by amendment No. 2.  Amendment No. 104 amends Article 4 to maintain the position that the chairmanship of the board will be a whole-time job but to limit the application of the remaining provision to a case where a former judge is appointed.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 105 is just a drafting change in Article 5 to take account of the position of a judge nominated as chairman.  Article 28 provides for the making of a scheme for the granting of pensions to board members. Amendment No. 119 inserts a new paragraph excluding any provision being made in such scheme in respect of a chairman during any period while he is a judge of the High Court.  In other words, we do not want to have a duplication there.</P>

      <P>The basic concern we must have in relation to this board is that it must be free from any Government interference.  The Minister will agree that the purpose of setting up the board was to remove from the Minister the power he had relating to planning appeals and the transfer to a board.  The chairman will be a very important factor in decision-making. Therefore, I think it is vitally necessary that he should be free from any Government interference; otherwise I feel the purpose of the Bill could be nullified.  If the Government have the right themselves to remove the chairman at will he is no longer a free agent.  He needs to be a free agent to carry out his duties properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it necessary. Article 6 requires the Government to show cause if they remove the chairman of the board from office. If the Government wish to do so they are restricted.  The chairman <Col N="2298" /> must be incapable through ill-health of efficiently performing his duties or his removal must be necessary for the effective performance of the board of their functions.  The board will have considerable administrative responsibility in trying to handle about 4,000 appeals a year.  It is unlikely that the chairman will prove grossly inefficient or adopt an obstructive attitude or frustrate the intention of the legislation, but it is necessary to provide for such a situation in case it should arise.  It has been known that High Court judges have done some rather peculiar things.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy drew attention to another aspect, misbehaviour, and it is proposed to cover this specifically in amendment No. 111.  If such a situation arose it would be essential for the Government to act promptly. Article 6 restricts the circumstances in which they may act and they have to state reasons in writing which must be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas, so that there would be no fear that they would act perversely. If the matter had to be debated first in both Houses the effects might be prejudicial to the chairman and the board.  Even if he was not removed from office his position would be undermined.  It has to be reported to the Dáil and the Seanad.  In Article 6 it states the reasons for which he may be removed.  We discussed this fully when we were discussing Article 6.</P>

      <P>If the reason for removing him was that he was frustrating the intention of the Act, who would decide that?  Can the Minister visualise a situation where the Government simply wanted to get rid of the chairman and put this forward as a reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Molloy, I move amendment No. 108:</P>
      <P>To delete Article 7 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.  Each ordinary member of the board shall be appointed through the Civil Service Commission on the basis of independent interview and shall have such qualifications and hold his office on such terms and conditions as the Minister, with the concent of the Minister for the Public Service, determined.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister will accept that over the years the whole question of planning appeals has been rather emotive.  It certainly has been very controversial and has brought a fair amount of frustration and annoyance to Ministers Local Government.  I think that what Deputy Molloy has in mind here is that the question of the appointment of the board should not in any way militate against the manner in which the members of the board would operate.  However annoying it is for politicians to say it, apparently hitherto the taint of the political has been referred to.  The members of the board, if appointed by the political head of the Department, may be mildly embarrassed by it.  As proposed in the amendment tabled by Deputy Molloy, if members are appointed through the Civil Service Commission, nobody can ever accuse any Minister of having any interest at all. The members of the board would be free from whatever charges, however unfounded, that might be made against them because they might be described as political appointees.</P>

      <P>The point I wanted to make was that the lesson the Minister learned as to the impartiality of his predecessor in the matter of planning appeals is one he has learned because of his privileged position, but unfortunately he is the only person in the country who has had the opportunity of learning that.  Other people still think along the wrong lines&mdash; whether we should thank him for that or not is another thing&mdash;but the fact is that the further planning <Col N="2302" /> appeals are removed from the political scene, the better it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I would make.  There is genuine difficulty in applying procedure of this kind in that qualifications have to be declared and selected people would have to be accepted.  The quality of the board would be dependent on the number and type of candidates who would present themselves for short term appointments, and the more experienced people are the civil servants who have been dealing with appeals.  Even if they were excluded from a competition, there is a danger that the result would give an unbalanced corps consisting mainly of lawyers, architects or members of some other profession.  In this Deputy Callanan and I are on the same ground.  Professional qualifications are not nearly so important in this case as integrity, common sense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Haughey I move amendment No. 109:</P>
      <P>In Article 7 after &ldquo;appointed&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in a whole-time capacity&rdquo; and to delete (a) from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in the second line down to and including &ldquo;years&rdquo; in the third line and (b) &ldquo;the foregoing and to&rdquo; in the fourth line.</P>
      <P>It would be agreed that this board which will be dealing with planning appeals will have a full-time job and the members should therefore be appointed in a whole-time capacity. This amendment simply stresses that fact.</P>
      <P>This board differs from most State boards in that the members will be acting in a direct capacity rather than in the capacity members of boards usually act in.  Therefore, these words &ldquo;in a whole-time capacity&rdquo; might be inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect would be that all ordinary members of the board would have to be appointed in a whole-time capacity in the same way as the chairman.  It was left open because <Col N="2303" /> it was thought that the Minister might wish to consider appointing to the board persons who might not be free to act whole-time but who might be valuable in an advisory and consultative capacity.  I am thinking particularly of members of professional associations.  It is normal practice to specify a term of office of members of boards of semi-State bodies and this enables rotation of membership although there is usually provision for reappointment.  This would apply in the case of An Bord Plannála.</P>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner says that this is a different board and that there is a case for continuous service so that advantage could be taken of the experience members would gain over a period. That could be an argument but I think that you propose to delete the provision enabling the term of office to be fixed for three years and the consequential amendment.  I am not happy about it.  I think it will do something which would tie it up and produce the type of board which this House would not want.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 110:</P>
      <P>To delete Article 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see the need for this specific provision.  If the Minister can appoint anybody he wishes to the board, it will be open to him to include his serving officers.  I am disturbed that this provision is being inserted.  As I said before, the purpose of the Bill is to transfer the responsibility for deciding planning appeals from the Minister to the board.  By inserting this section, it would appear that the Minister could, to quite a considerable extent, retain certain power in relation to appeals because the members of his Department would be subject to him as Minister and would be responsible to him in many ways, in his Departmental duties. Everybody would be happier, and I am sure the Minister himself would <Col N="2304" /> be happier if this Article were deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 8 will allow the Minister to appoint an ordinary member of the board from his serving officers.  No decision on this matter has been taken and the power need not be exercised.  But strictly speaking, the Article is not necessary and its purpose is solely to draw attention to the possibility that it might be desirable to have someone with experience in planning development and control of policies to provide a measure of continuity and to assist this board, especially in the initial stages.  We had a long discussion on this when the Article was discussed here and while it is possible that some of the serving personnel might be the right people to have on the board, particularly when the board is starting and they can show them the ropes at the same time, to exclude them completely would mean that if there was nobody on it, they would all have to start in the new. If at any time there was a shortage, and there could be, it may turn out that people will not be falling over each other to look for appointment to this board and if that happened, we might either have to appoint somebody who was not the type we wanted, or fill it with an excellent serving officer.  It would be wrong to exclude him.</P>
      <P>The question of looking after pension rights, and so on, would have to be guaranteed if they were included, even for a part-time period.  The idea of having the right to put them on the board is a good one.  The whole thing is tied up with the early discussion of whether we should have so many planners, engineers, and so on, on the board.  A number of people referred to this.  It was suggested that these people would be left off, if planners belonging to the Department were put on.  That was the argument as I saw it.  There is nothing wrong with the suggestion that, if necessary, they should be eligible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is not necessary that people should be on the board to help the board?  In other words, if the board is set up, I am sure the people he has in mind would be available to assist them, direct them and help them in every way possible.  The only question I would ask is: is this Article here because it relates to pension, and so on?  In other words, had the Minister to insert this because of pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Not at all.  Let me make one thing very clear.  Deputy Faulkner is suggesting that if a planner from the Department of Local Government is put on the board, that that planner would be chasing back to my office saying look at this; this is what they are doing, and so on.  He will be completely clear and will have no connection <Col N="2306" /> with the Minister for Local Government as long as he is on that board. That is his job, and what he does there has nothing to do with the Minister nor is he entitled to bring back reports of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I never suggested that.  What I was suggesting was that as a civil servant he would be subject to the Minister, not as a member of the planning board.  This is a different thing.  My point is that the Minister can appoint anybody he so wishes.  I do not think it is desirable.  To be quite frank, from the Minister's point of view I do not think it is desirable either.  However, the Minister insists on it: I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 111:</P>
      <P>In page 23, to insert &ldquo;, or who has committed stated misbehaviour,&rdquo; before &ldquo;or whose removal&rdquo; in Article 10.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage Deputy Molloy agreed that there must be procedures for removal of the chairman from office, but suggested that the grounds be confined to ill-health, stated misbehaviour or incapacity of some kind. Amendment No. 106 adds stated misbehaviour to criteria for removal from office of a chairman who was a former judge.  Incapacity through ill-health is already covered specifically in Article 10 and specific provision is now being made for stated misbehaviour.  The same criteria will apply to removal from office of an ordinary member. It says to insert &ldquo;or who has committed stated misbehaviour,&rdquo; before &ldquo;or whose removal&rdquo; in Article 10. This has been done to comply with what was asked for on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

      <P>I move amendment No. 112:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Article 12, second line, to delete &ldquo;or for election to either House of the Oireachtas&rdquo; and in <Col N="2307" /> the third line after &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;either House of the Oireachtas or of&rdquo; and in the fourth line after &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;either House or of&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know the mind of Deputy Haughey on this.  As far as I am concerned, in a matter of professional integrity or impartiality I would rate a Member of the Dáil or Seanad Éireann as high as anybody else in the land.  I do not like the inferred reflection which occurs in legislation where we exclude Members of both Houses.  On the other hand, I am not advocating that they should be members. I do not see why, if somebody has been offered a nomination for the Seanad, a professional man&mdash;we have accepted that professional men can be members of this board&mdash;the President of the Engineers' Association, the President of the Architects' Association, or indeed anybody else who might offer himself for election to the Seanad or the Dáil, should be prevented from being a member of this board.  The Minister may say that this is a precedent.  It is time politicians removed themselves from that.  If a politician can be Attorney General I do not see why if somebody offers himself for membership of this House or of the Upper House that <i>ipso facto</i> he should disqualify himself from membership of this board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to disagree with Deputy Tunney on this.  I have always held that there is an undue discrimination, not against politicians but against members of politicians' families.  Time and again sons and daughters, or brothers or sisters of politicians, are discreetly barred from certain employments because they have a political connection.  It does not matter which side of the House they are on.  There are people who think there should be some kind of a bar against everybody connected with politicians.  I hold that that is wrong.  I would not hold that an active politician&mdash;he must be such or he would not be nominated for office in either House of the Oireachtas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should go into the House and watch how they vote and he will then see whether they are active or not.  I am not casting a slur on them.  Perhaps in their own interests it might be as well that they are not.  They could be embarrassed by somebody putting pressure on them.  I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.  I agree with the principle behind it, particularly with regard to politicians' families.  Perhaps some day we might have to do something about that.  I think politicians are a special case.  It would react more against them than anybody else if we allowed them to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before we withdraw the amendment could I mention one thing?  When I was on that side of the House I remember having a Bill before the House, and a very strong case was made by both Fine Gael and Labour Deputies, to have not only those who were nominated to the Dáil or Seanad on boards but Deputies. They felt it was most unfair that Deputies or intending Deputies should be singled out for this type of treatment. They made such a good case that I tended to agree with them except that I did not think that we should introduce it in this particular Bill, but that a special Bill to deal with it should be introduced.  I accept that there is a difference in this case.</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  It arises from the need to bring the wording of Article 12 into line with the provisions of the Electoral Act in relation to nominations for elections.

      <P>In page 24, to delete &ldquo;of its employees&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;person&rdquo; in Article 24.</P>
      <P>This amendment is consequential to amendment No. 42 to section 19 under which the board may as an interim measure make arrangements for the supply of services.  If this included staff it would be necessary that such staff should for the purposes of Article 24 be in the same position as applies to the board. Article 24 is a standard provision for statutory bodies which avoids the necessity for a board decision or resolution to authorise the exercise of each function in each case.</P>
      <P>References of appeal, and so forth, are matters which must be decided at board level, but other functions may be entrusted to the staff under such practical administrative arrangements as the board thinks fit.  The amendment is necessary to avoid the possibility that if an arrangement for the supply of staff were made under section 19, as amended, an appeal decision by the board might be challenged in the courts on the ground that the board was not being advised and serviced by its own employees appointed under section 10, so it is to avoid a High Court case at the very start of the board's life.</P>
