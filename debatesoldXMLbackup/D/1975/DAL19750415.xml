      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that independent medical opinion given in relation to this man's health suggests he is in a satisfactory healthy condition for the duties of a postman? The gentleman concerned disputed the decision given which resulted in the termination of his employment some months ago and he has since been unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The person in question indicated his willingness to be examined by any doctor nominated by the Department.  A special examination by a departmental medical officer in Galway was arranged for him and, on the basis of that medical report and in the light of the officer's absences from duty, it was recommended that his appeal be refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Department of Posts and <Col N="1511" /> Telegraphs have offered work to this man on a temporary basis if he wishes to apply for it?  Would the Minister not agree that in such circumstances there seems to be a conflict on the interpretation being put on the health report?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Minister to a letter of 20th December, 1974, from the postmaster in Galway who stated that if he wished to be considered for temporary work in the Department he should register with the National Manpower Services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs why a registered letter containing postal orders for £15 originally posted in November, 1974, (details supplied) has not yet been delivered at Kerala, South India; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The registered letter was delivered but the Indian Post Office refused to cash the postal orders on the grounds that the date stamp impressions on them were indistinct. The postal orders were returned to the sender who asked my Department to send the payee an international money order instead. There was, regrettably, considerable delay in complying with this request but the necessary instructions were sent by airmail to the Indian Post Office on the 24th March, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that instructions were sent by airmail to the Indian Post Office on 24th March.  That is the last information I have about the matter but if the Deputy has information that it has <Col N="1512" /> not been received I shall have the matter looked into.  I might add that it is my view that this matter was mishandled and I am taking steps in connection with this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Letters between Dublin and Kerry posted before the appropriate latest posting times in the evening are normally delivered by first post on the following working day.  Letters posted after those times are normally delivered by second post on the following working day where provided, otherwise by first post on the next following working day.  If the Deputy can furnish details of particular cases in which delays appear to have occurred, I will have them specially investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that a telegram sent to a firm (name supplied) in County Dublin was handed in at Tuam post office at 11.43 a.m. with instructions to place bets on the 2.30 p.m. horse race on 4th December, 1974, and that this telegram was never delivered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>A telegram in code, which I assume is the one referred to, was received at the local sub-post office at 12.34 p.m. on the 4th December, 1974.  My Department were advised in January, 1971, that special telegraph facilities provided <Col N="1513" /> by the Department at the race course concerned were no longer required. The firm in question does not accept telegrams for delivery by telephone and, accordingly, telegrams to the firm have to be delivered by hand. Hand delivery in the area is done by the local sub-post office, special arrangements being made to cover the weekly Saturday half-day at that office.  As is the case with all but the larger post offices, there is no regular telegram delivery staff employed at the sub-post office concerned and telegrams for the area are normally delivered by casual messenger.  On the date in question the postmaster was unable to secure a casual messenger to deliver the telegram promptly and, unfortunately, it arrived too late for its purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that, in a case such as this where the post office is adjacent to one of the major race courses in the country, adequate staff should be available to deliver such telegrams? Obviously the firm in question, Tote Investors Limited, do quite an amount of their business by way of the telegram and telephone services of the Department, which are advertised as available for this and other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The race course concerned originally had special telegraph facilities and they informed my Department in January, 1971, that these facilities were no longer required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister stating that such services need not be available in a local post office such as Leopardstown which is adjacent to an important race course where meetings are held quite often?  Would the Minister not offer some sympathy to the person who had placed this winning bet which is not now valid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I have sympathy with the individual concerned.  The circumstance was unfortunate but that is not tantamount to an admission of liability on behalf of the Post Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that persons should be <Col N="1514" /> available to deliver such telegrams from Leopardstown Post Office? Would the Minister say either &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that?  The telegram was delivered quite early at this post office but they did not deliver it for hours afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will arrange for the provision of a letter box at Ballyroe, Athy, County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a letterbox at Ballyroe would not be warranted by the use likely to be made of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that residents in the Ballyroe area have to travel three-and-a-half miles to post a letter and does he not think they deserve better facilities than that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The facilities provided are equivalent to those provided generally and those which in the past have been provided for small rural districts in thinly populated areas like this.  The delivering postman carries a stock of stamps and accepts letters for posting.  That is normal procedure in such cases.  I think these standards are reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a service provided by a postman delivering letters which would not allow time to reply by return to letters is not very satisfactory? Is he aware that in the time of a previous regime a post box was provided in that area and now that postmen are mechanised it should not involve any undue hardship to have an evening collection in such an area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>An evening collection could be provided only by diverting a contract mail vehicle a <Col N="1515" /> distance of three-and-a-half miles a day and the cost of extending the contract service would be out of all proportion to the small amount of correspondence that would benefit.  Postings in the box, if one were provided, would be unlikely to exceed 12 a week, I am informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that it would be better to have one postal official travel three miles a day rather than have a certain number of people from Ballyroe travelling three-and-a-half miles into Athy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when a dial line will be installed in Drangan Post Office, County Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the facility sought by the Deputy is one which would enable the Drangan operator to dial direct, using Drangan-Clonmel trunks, to automatic numbers in the Clonmel charge group and to some manual exchanges in the Clonmel area without intervention of the Clonmel operator as is necessary at present.</P>
      <P>I am advised that provision&mdash;in advance of the conversion of Drangan to automatic working&mdash;of the dialling facility sought would require the design and installation of special non-standard equipment.  This would be necessary for technical reasons because of the length of the trunk lines between Drangan and Clonmel.  Accordingly, it is not proposed to provide the dialling facility at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state (a) the number of applicants awaiting telephones in County Wexford at present (b) the number of applications on hands during the last two years (c) the number of applications on hands during the last 12 months and (d) the proposals he has for dealing with applications in an acceptable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>About 730. There are, in addition, almost 100 for <Col N="1516" /> whom telephones will be installed within the next two months or so.</P>
      <P>About 680 of the 730 applications on hands were made during the last two years, and about 440 of them were made during the last 12 months.</P>
      <P>It is hoped to instal telephones for about 350 of the 730 by the end of this year and for the balance&mdash;largely those requiring abnormal linework&mdash; progressively during 1976 and 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that a two-year waiting period for a telephone is acceptable?  Is there nothing his Department can do to cut out the frustrating delays experienced by applicants for telephones at present?  We have in Wexford&mdash;and I am sure the same applies to every county in Ireland&mdash;waiting periods of over two years.  This is a horrible situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I am not satisfied and the Government are not satisfied and no Minister would be satisfied with the situation in which there is a long waiting list for telephones.  The only answer is to step up the rate of connections and this is being done.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the present situation is, to say the least of it, Iudicrous?  If one makes a 'phone call in the north county area using the numbers shown in the new directory, a recorded voice says that the subscriber is available at the 1974 number.  What happens if you do not have a 1974 directory close at hand, the standard situation in public kiosks? The recorded message is not adequate. Surely the Minister can change it?</P>

      <P>What method would the Deputy suggest?  I regret the inconveniences to subscribers in such circumstances but it is inevitable, and it always has been, in an expanding telephone system.  The number changes in north County Dublin referred to by the Deputy affect subscribers in certain areas and will take effect when a new exchange is opened at Santry about the end of May.  Until that takes place, this is the only way in which we can deal with this situation.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister gone into this matter personally and investigated the fairness or justice of this overall clamp-down on the provision of kiosks where it can be shown that a need for them truly <Col N="1525" /> exists and that the lack of service in certain areas in the country is abysmal?  If he has not done this to his satisfaction, will he undertake to do so?  I can assure him that there is a dire need for public kiosks all over the country.  We cannot merely wash our hands of it and say that if there is no post office there will not be any kiosk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely wrong to refer to any &ldquo;clamp-down&rdquo; in relation to kiosks.  The principle which I mentioned here has been followed for a very long time and was followed by a Government in which Deputy Blaney was a member without, so far as I know, any protest against that system.  The only modification introduced is that kiosks can now be provided under guarantee by the local authority or by any other creditworthy group against the loss involved in providing and maintaining them.  Deputies interested in getting a kiosk for a given area have the opportunity of proceeding according to this method.  A number of Deputies have already done so and a number of such guarantees have been provided.  The system is working well.</P>

I said, in reply to the question, that kiosks are not provided in rural areas where there are no post offices.  Policy has been to provide kiosks in rural areas only in replacement of call office telephones in sub-post offices and also to provide such kiosks in places where there have not been sub-post offices but where the local authority are prepared <Col N="1526" /> to provide a guarantee or where another body, such as Muintir na Tíre for example, are prepared to guarantee the Department against loss.

      <P>I accept your ruling, whichever it may be, but before taking a new question I think I should answer a question already put. My understanding about Dunmore village is that it is quite a small hamlet without a post office.  If I am wrong in any of this, the Deputy can correct me.  It comprises eight houses, a church and a shop with a population of about 30, within a one mile radius of a population of about 150. Since there is no sub-post office at Dunmore the provision of a kiosk there cannot be favourably considered under existing regulations and practice but a kiosk could be provided at Dunmore under guarantee against the loss involved in providing and maintaining it and the Deputy might wish to consider that possibility.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, what I want to get to is his original reply.  Is he really telling the House that he is merely following a practice already established, which implies that no telephone kiosks were provided under the previous Government other than outside post offices?  Is he really putting to the House that all these areas, which his Department should be serving, should now, in fact, be subsidised out of the rates and by the ratepayers, who are already so heavily overburdened that they can scarcely carry the load placed on them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question what is involved is not subsidisation, except contingently.  What is provided is a guarantee against loss and no local authority are required to give such guarantee unless they wish to do so.

      <P>The position in regard to postmen's cycles has been difficult for several years.  Supplies of this particular type of cycle have not been commercially available in sufficient quantities to meet all the Department's demands but, except for the Christmas pressure period, requisitions are now being met without delay.  Difficulties have also arisen in getting supplies of the main accessories for postmen's cycles, and efforts to locate alternative sources of supply of these items have had only limited success so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The only complaint I received from this association was about reception from two piped television systems serving their area.  The statutory responsibilities of my Department for cable television systems are limited to licensing such systems and ensuring that operators comply with the conditions of their licences, including technical conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as reception is concerned, the technical conditions attached to licences are designed to ensure that the television signals picked up at the masthead are not downgraded while being relayed to the service point in customers' homes, that interference is not caused by the system to other apparatus and that the system complies <Col N="1531" /> with safety requirements.  I have no reason to believe that the two systems serving this area are not technically efficient and I do not propose to take any action about the complaint.</P>
    <P>I might mention that reception from any piped television system depends firstly on the strength and consistency of the signals available at the masthead and secondly on the efficient relay of those signals to subscribers to the system.  The quality of the BBC and IBA signals available off air at the masthead is, of course, completely outside my Department's control.</P>
    <P>I understand that the two cable companies which serve the area in question have advised that reception on the two cable systems is satisfactory at present.  They say that reception had been adversely affected by the quality of signals available off air but this has improved recently following (1) correction of a fault in the Divis transmitter in Northern Ireland and (2) connection of the systems to alternative masts where better quality signals are available.  This latter step was made possible by the Government's decision in August, 1973, to revoke the 500 home limit previously imposed on cable systems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the action he is taking to secure a resumption of work in the fishing industry in view of the disastrous effects each <Col N="1544" /> day's stoppage is having on the livelihood of fishermen and the fish trade generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that the present interruption of activities in the fishing industry is the direct result of the actions which have been taken by the fishermen and can only be put right by the fishermen discontinuing these actions.  If they feel that further discussion of their problems would be useful, I will be glad to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Has this not come about because the Parliamentary Secretary has refused to give any satisfaction to the fishermen on the various points they brought before him on a number of occasions?  Is it not a fact that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has refused to meet the fishermen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became Parliamentary Secretary two years ago I met the fishermen on numerous occasions and discussed their problems with them.  I gave them all the help and assistance possible.  I emphasised the desirability of the involvement of the fishermen, BIM and the Department in the formulation of policy.  So far as the position generally is concerned, the aids made available to our fishermen compare more than favourably with aids made available by any other country.  Despite the difficulties which beset the economy during the last two years and as evidence of the Government's confidence in the industry the amounts provided by the Exchequer increased from £4,115,000 to £7,940,000.  That was for fisheries generally.  Of this amount £7,103,000 is being expended on sea fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that we have practically doubled the amount for fisheries; we have increased it by more than £3 million.  Taking into account inflation, and any other items Deputies wish to bring in, it can be said that this Government stood firmly and loyally by the fishermen. That being the case, we are very disappointed <Col N="1545" /> that the fishermen took the action they did this week with the disruption of public facilities.  I do not think the action was warranted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary stating that the claims of the fishermen are not justified?  If the Government are prepared to meet the fishermen, what are they prepared to meet them on?  The fishermen have already stated their case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>For three hours last Tuesday with senior officers of my Department I discussed all aspects of the industry with representatives of the fishermen.  This was a most comprehensive discussion which covered all aspects of the industry. I cannot see what grievance, if any, they can have, so far as the Department are concerned.  We had discussions with representatives of the organisation in May, 1974, and they indicated then that they were anxious to make a claim for a subsidy towards the cost of increase in fuel prices.  I informed them that if such a claim was to be presented it would have to be statistically presented with proper accountancy of their profitability and returns of their profit and loss accounts.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that neither a Minister nor a Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that we forced him to put more money into the industry because the Book of Estimates showed there was a reduction? It was only a second thought on the part of the Government to allocate this extra money.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that any extra money provided is barely sufficient to meet the development that has been in progress for years?  There has been a progressive policy of development in train in this industry and it has nothing to do with the fishermen's day-to-day profits or losses. Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that in this House last week he castigated the fishermen when replying to questions by pointing out that unless they produced audited figures and definite accounts he would have nothing further to do with them?</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he is serious when he says that he has been meeting the fishermen and is prepared to meet them again against the background of his reply to the question which was that what is happening at the moment is as a direct result of the fishermen themselves?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary indicating that the import of fish from outside countries is the result of the action of the fishermen? Is the Parliamentary Secretary also saying that the cost of fuel is in any way the direct result of the fishermen?  Is he saying that the clamour and justifiable demand for an extended fishery limit is their fault?  Is he saying that the total lack of protection in an overall sense is their fault in so far as their livelihood is concerned?  Is he saying that this is so?  He wants to talk to them.  Yet he says he is giving them more than anybody else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A number of these resolutions are based on the assumption that certain items in the Bill will be accepted, items to which there are amendments down.

      <P>This section increases the dependent relative's allowance from £80 to £95.  It also raises the income limit for the purposes of the allowance from £409 to £497, which takes account of the increase in the non-contributory <Col N="1560" /> old age pension announced in the budget which came into effect on 1st April last.  Where the dependent relative has other income, the allowance of £95 is reduced by £1 for each £1 of the excess of the income over £497 so that no allowance is payable when the dependent relative's income is £592 or more.

      <P>Perhaps I should explain this.  Under the new and simplified income tax structure instituted last year relief in respect of life insurance premiums became available to taxpayers at whatever was their marginal rate of tax.  In the case of taxpayers liable at rates exceeding 35 per cent this resulted in a widening of the cash differential of rebate as between Irish and non-Irish insurance companies.  There were representations on this point and I announced in the House during the passage of the Finance Bill, 1974, that I would be bringing in amending legislation this year.  This section complies with that undertaking.  It restores to the pre-1974 level the amount of the cash differential.  This is done by increasing the relief in the case concerned where the policies are with non-Irish companies to a figure which is less than the relief in respect of policies with Irish companies by the amount of the pre-1974 differential. These arrangements will apply from 1974-75 onwards.  They are retrospective to that extent.</P>

First, is the form of the section such that it has the approval&mdash;and I am using that word in a wide sense&mdash;of the various insurance companies, Irish and non-Irish?  I say &ldquo;approval&rdquo; in the sense that it is not for them to approve but the Minister is <Col N="1561" /> aware that they were concerned about what was being done last year and made representations to him.  I should like to know if the Minister is satisfied that the Irish and non-Irish insurance companies are satisfied with the position as indicated in this section.</P>
      <P>The second question is whether the position which obtained under last year's Finance Act in relation to any person paying a premium is now being made worse as regards income tax relief, or is every payer of an insurance premium who is subject to tax under this section either better off than or at least as well off as he would have been under last year's section?</P>

      <P>This extends to 31st March, 1977 the period of operation of the initial allowance of 100 per cent in respect of capital expenditure on new machinery or plant.  I would remind the House that I emphasised it would be wrong to assume allowances of this kind would continue indefinitely but we were concerned to continue these allowances at the moment as an encouragement to people to invest capital in new machinery or plant because the world is going to take off in an economic upswing later this year or early in 1976 and success invariably comes to those who anticipate changes in economic behaviour.  This change will take place at world level in the not too distant future and now is the time when wise people will invest in new machinery or plant to ensure they have at the right time the capacity for growth which is on its way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section proposes to extend for another two years the 100 per cent initial allowance in respect of capital expenditure on new machinery or plant.  I think this was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1972.  There is a great deal more that should be done, but that is hardly relevant to this section.  In so far as what is being done is a step in the right direction we will certainly support it.  I say it is a step in the right direction because it is a step, admittedly a small one, on the road to ensuring the encouragement of greater investment particularly in industry. Looking at our economic situation today, clearly the only hope we have of a solution not only to our employment problem but also to inflation and to combating inflation is to increase our growth rate which is now virtually nil.  This section will not noticeably do that but it will contribute.  The extension of these allowances, which were, as I say, granted by the Fianna Fáil Government in the past, at this time is something that will help.  It will not produce any magic wand, but it is a step in the right direction.  For that reason we support this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is another Government inspired incentive to industry to invest now and expand in preparation for the growth the world economy will develop later this year and throughout 1976.  I have no wish to take from any credit Fianna Fáil wish to confer upon themselves, but it is worthy of historical observation that this was introduced for the first time in 1956. What we are dealing with here is the initial allowance in respect of capital expenditure on industrial buildings and structures in use for the purpose of trade carried on in a mill, factory, or other similar premises, or for the purpose of a dock undertaking.  Increasing that allowance, as we are increasing it this year, from 10 per cent to 50 per cent is providing a very specific incentive for the construction industry at a time when it has been going through some difficulties.  It is <Col N="1564" /> also an incentive to our industrial sector to increase its capacity to meet the opportunities and challenges of 1975 and 1976.</P>
      <P>In section 6 we will also be increasing the annual allowance in respect of expenditure on such buildings. That will be increased from 2 per cent to 4 per cent.  The section also increases from 10 per cent to 20 per cent the initial allowance in respect of capital expenditure incurred on or after 6th April, 1974, on market garden buildings.  This brings the initial allowance for such expenditure into line with that being provided for expenditure on farm buildings under section 18 of the Bill. Since there is also an annual allowance of 10 per cent, the total amount of such expenditure can be written off over eight years&mdash;that is to say, 30 per cent in the first year and 10 per cent in each succeeding year; the balance of 70 per cent then would be written off over a seven-year period following the first period.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these new allowances is to provide an immediate incentive for investment in industry, including the construction industry. The allowances are available in respect of capital expenditure incurred on or after 16th January last, that is, after the date of the budget. We did that because of the desirability of providing immediate and useful incentives.  The benefits are already being reflected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section continues the suspension of the shipping investment allowances on expenditure incurred up to 31st March, 1977.  The House will recall that section 8 of the 1973 Finance Act suspended operation <Col N="1566" /> of the 40 per cent investment allowance in respect of expenditure incurred after 24th July, 1973, where it is payable on the purchase of a new ship.  The suspension was to continue until 31st March, 1975, but the date up to which free depreciation and the 100 per cent initial allowance was available and operative has been extended until 31st March, 1977.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1973 states that the shipping investment allowance is not to apply to expenditure incurred before 1st April, 1975. This date is now being changed to 1st April, 1977.  The special benefit of an investment allowance is that the investment allowance is not taken into account for the purpose of wear and tear deductions so that up to 140 per cent of the capital expenditure is written off against profits.  This special provision was made available in respect of the purchase of new ships because of the particular needs of shipping companies which operate in highly competitive fields.  Because shipping companies generally are not in a profit making position, there are no or insufficient profits against which the generous capital allowance available can be set off.</P>
      <P>However, this situation led to the development of arrangements through which a bank bought a ship and leased it to a shipping company.  The bank then claimed the benefit of the capital allowance on the ground that it had incurred capital expenditure on the provision of the ship.  It will be clearly seen that the effect of such an operation was that the benefit of the allowance went not to shipping companies but to banks and there is clearly no obligation on parliament to provide a mechanism whereby banks and other financial institutions can make a profit by applying to them an allowance which was intended for a totally different purpose&mdash;to provide relief for shipping companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed some reservations on the wisdom of this in the debate on the 1973 Bill.  I still have those reservations but I should like to mention them again, although I do not wish to make an issue of <Col N="1567" /> them.  I had hoped the Minister would have looked into the matter since.  I am not sure he has.  My reservation is that the Minister has described the operation whereby a bank rather than a shipping company got the benefit of this allowance.  I am sure that is not the whole story.  The complete story is that the bank got the benefit of the allowance, as a result of which the shipping company got the ship at a lower price, I think over a certain number of years, because the bank was able to get this allowance.</P>
      <P>The consequence of that was that the drain on admittedly very scarce capital resources of the Exchequer was eased because ultimately the finding of the capital resources necessary was coming back to the Exchequer. To that extent I am not sure the Minister is wise in trying to prevent that allowance being obtained by the bank, provided the benefit of the allowance is reflected fully in the price paid by the shipping company.  The net effect is to save demands on Exchequer capital resources.</P>
      <P>I think that is the position.  I am speaking from recollection, but if it is I have some reservations as to the wisdom of the prevention of this allowance being earned by a bank.  I have expressed this view in the House before and having done so and nothing having been done one way or another, the Minister not having adverted to it, there is not much hope that anything will be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy will dissent from this approach.  I believe that if Parliament wants to give assistance to an industry, in this case the shipping industry, it should know what it is doing and be able to price exactly the assistance it is giving.  The operation here was one in which if such assistance were given by way of a lesser lease charge to the company, the lion's share then was being taken by the banks, so that banks found as a result of a legislative measure an opportunity to make inordinate profits far above the normal commercial level at which money could be lent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> I do not think it would be correct for Parliament to maintain a scheme which allowed a concealed benefit to be earned by a banking institution or, indeed, by anybody else.  If aid is needed for any particular industry, and Parliament in its wisdom decides that aid should be given, Parliament should know precisely what that aid is.  If as a consequence of somebody getting a tax advantage less money is received by the Exchequer, it is the general body of taxpayers who lose out.  The consequence of the arrangements used by the banks was that the Exchequer did not get its fair return of the money that was made available and the result was a loss to the Exchequer.  It would have been better to have a known amount of money given specifically than to have an operation of the kind we had, which was an opaque and concealed benefit to certain banking institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the proposition the Minister put forward. I would remind him that when I spoke earlier I said I thought there was a case for giving this allowance to a bank provided the benefit was passed on in the lease price the shipping company paid.  In regard to the particular transaction the Minister and I have in mind, I do not know at this time whether the bank got the lion's share of the benefit involved.  My recollection of the situation as it was presented to me was to the contrary, that the benefit was being passed to the shipping company, which was a State company.  If the allowance is fully passed on, or virtually fully passed on, it is necessary to do the sums.  It is necessary, in order to see if there is a loss to the Exchequer, to find out how much the Exchequer is foregoing and also how much it is costing the Exchequer to borrow the necessary capital and pay interest.  I do not wish to prolong this matter.  I merely wish to place on record the reservations I have and the reasons for them.  I think the situation is slightly more complex than was originally presented by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done our arithmetic on this matter and we are satisfied the Exchequer was a net loser under such a system, and a benefit was being obtained by the banking organisation involved.  This was never intended.  The full benefit of the allowance was not passed to the shipping company.  Of course it is difficult to assess precisely the appropriate rate for the leasing of a ship because leasing terms can vary considerably depending on market demand.  For instance, it is a lot cheaper to lease a tanker nowadays than it was two years ago.  On the basis of advice we have received from people who are familiar with the maritime scene, we are satisfied that only a proportion of the investment allowance here ultimately reached the shipping company by virtue of some modification that might be made in the leasing terms.  The cream of the allowance was enjoyed by the banks.  If we were to accept what Deputy Colley said and endeavoured to take steps to ensure the total benefit of the allowance was passed on by the banks to the shipping company, the banks would not be interested in using the facility.  There would be no point in their getting involved in such an arrangement unless they could make a profit <Col N="1570" /> greater than that obtained by investing the money elsewhere.  It follows from the existence of the arrangement that the banks engage in such transactions because they enjoy a profit they could not obtain by investing elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section exempts from income tax the monthly payments to be made by the Minister for Health pursuant to the Government's decision to make payments to Irish victims of the thalidomide drug. The compensation payments from the West German Foundation in respect of these children were exempt from income tax by section 19 of the Finance Act, 1973, and that exemption is being extended to cover the supplementary payments from the Irish Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The section provides that monthly payments made by the Minister for Health after 1st January, 1975, in respect of thalidomide victims are to be disregarded for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts.  This means that not only will the payments be exempt from income tax but they will not be taken into account for the purpose of any reliefs claimed by the victims' parents or guardians.  For example, the monthly payments will not be regarded as income for the purpose of the child tax allowance, so that the payments will not have any effect on the parents' title to child allowance in respect of the child.  In the ordinary way, where the child's income exceeds £80, the income tax allowance in respect of the child&mdash;now it is £230&mdash; will be abated by £ for each £ of income in excess of £80.  The total provision for payments for thalidomide children from the Irish Exchequer in 1975 is £414,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We considered it as administratively appropriate to have the wealth tax, first of all, assessed on a date which is related to the conclusion of the financial year.  The wealth tax will be paid during the tax year 1975.  We now have two different creatures operating on different dates.  The tax year is April, 1975 to April, 1976.  That is why we link the two together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the purpose of the section is to reduce the higher rates of income tax.  He also said that it is designed to reduce those rates to coincide with the operation of the wealth tax.  But since this section is designed to operate from 6th April of this year, <Col N="1573" /> is it reasonable to assume the operation of the wealth tax on the same date?  Is it reasonable or realistic? The fact is that under the wealth tax, a taxpayer liable under the Bill as it stands becomes liable for wealth tax without assessment on 5th or 6th April and three months later if he has not paid the tax he becomes liable for interest on it at 18 per cent.</P>
      <P>Looking at the legislative programme of this House and of the other House, it seems it is not an unreasonable postulation that the wealth tax may not be law even on the expiration of the three months when the interest liability arises and that you could have the situation&mdash;which we have at present where people are liable for wealth tax without knowing what the law is&mdash;where people are paying a penal rate of interest on their liability for wealth tax without knowing what the law is.  If that situation arises&mdash;it is not unreasonable to postulate it&mdash;I believe it is such an indefensible position that the Minister, if not of his own volition, may well, under pressure from many people who would find this situation incredible&mdash; the situation in which you are liable for tax and interest on that tax without the law being enacted under which you are supposed to make the assessment yourself&mdash;have to postpone the operation of the wealth tax to a date related to the enactment into law of the Wealth Tax Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that should happen, presumably the Minister would wish to apply the higher rates of tax put up to that date, rates of tax which under this section he proposes to abolish from 6th April this year.  It is true, and the Minister may be tempted to say it in reply, that I am engaging in speculation and that he can only deal with the situation as he finds it.  But I suggest it would be quite unrealistic of anybody to pretend that the sort of situation I have outlined is not a distinct possibility.  If it is, I think we should hear from the Minister on this section as to the kind of timetable he envisages so that we can see if it seems to be a reasonable timetable and if it is, on what date would he estimate that the wealth tax would have been enacted so that we <Col N="1574" /> can judge the efficacy or otherwise of the proposal in this section.</P>
    <P>There may be one or two other points that I want to raise on this but it might be more clear-cut if we could hear the Minister's views on the point I have put forward before going further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can be fairly explicit.  The wealth tax will be operational as from 5th April, 1975.  That is the date on which liability to pay the tax arises in respect of possessions or wealth on that date.  I have already indicated my intention to table an amendment which would extend the period for payment of the appropriate tax without attaching to the tax in this year a charge for interest.  I accept that people are entitled to know the law and should not be penalised until the law is definitely recorded, passed by both Houses and signed by the President.  We shall have an amendment to ensure that people will not, because of any delay in processing the legislation through the Oireachtas, be put at any disadvantage. But the liability to pay the wealth tax for those who had wealth on 5th April last arises, and the tax will be payable in 1975-76.  That is why we are providing this relief for the top ranges of income tax liability &mdash;so as to avoid any possibility of hardship arising out of the payment of both taxes which will be payable and collected in the year 1975-76.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When a tax is assessed on a specific date in 1975 it becomes payable in that financial year.  A tax is again assessed on a specified date in 1976.  In my view it is wrong to impose an interest charge on a tax which can be paid any time within that year.  I am sure we all look on rate payments as being due any time during the year.  I understand that the Minister made a concession for delaying in the first year the accumulation of interest for six months.  Surely it is unfair to ask for interest?  Fair enough if it accumulates after the date of the succeeding year when it is again assessed.  I repeat this is an annual tax and should be looked on as such.</P>

It must be paid in some cases within weeks from the time it is collected.  I have dealt with this already in the debate on the Wealth Tax Bill.  There is a wrong conception here and elsewhere on what the wealth tax is.  It is a tax on the holding of wealth on a particular date.  If one is not required to pay tax by law until after that date, one is obviously paying in arrear. One may argue about semantics and that is what we are doing here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point I would like to raise, which on the face of it may appear to be going even further into the wealth tax, but I cannot avoid it because this section is, as the Minister explained, tied in with the introduction of the wealth tax.  The section proposes to reduce the high rates of income tax in recognition of the fact that many taxpayers at present subject to the higher rates of tax will become liable to wealth tax.  If that is correct, then the correlation between income tax and wealth tax is something with which we must concern ourselves.</P>
      <P>I am in some difficulty because a point arose on the Wealth Tax Bill and arises under this section.  Since the section proposes to reduce the higher rates of tax in recognition of the payment of wealth tax by the same taxpayer, it raises the question of the amount of a person's income which should be taken between income tax and wealth tax.  The problem is that, as the Wealth Tax Bill stands at present, people could find themselves paying 110 per cent of their annual income in income tax and wealth tax together.  I say &ldquo;110 per cent&rdquo; but it could be even 150 per cent.  I said 110 per cent to illustrate the point that one could be paying more than one's total annual income in the combination of income tax and wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this section is designed to recognise the problems which can arise when somebody must pay wealth tax plus income tax and recognises that <Col N="1579" /> by reducing the higher rates of income tax, then it is in order for us to consider this combination and suggest&mdash; we suggested this on the Wealth Tax Bill but the Minister would not accept it&mdash;that provision should be made in this section whereby the combination of wealth tax and income tax will not exceed 100 per cent of a taxpayer's income.  I do not imagine I have to spell out why this restriction should be placed on the combination of the two taxes, but if it is not done on wealth tax it should be done on income tax.</P>
    <P>It is clear to everybody, whether they are liable for wealth tax or the higher rates of income tax, that the demand for an annual tax in excess of one's income is an unreasonable, unconscionable and indefensible demand. Therefore, I suggest that in this section provision should be made to ensure that the combination of income tax and wealth tax will not exceed 100 per cent of a taxpayer's income.</P>

      <P>It would be exceptional and it might arise in a situation in which a person had massive wealth which was yielding a negligible income. I would not consider it was for the benefit of the individual or of society that that kind of situation should be encouraged.  The formula we have devised here operates in a number of countries and works admirably.  One of the benefits of such an operation is that it encourages people to invest their money in assets which will yield them sufficient income rather than leaving it lie fallow in assets which confer little benefit on the economy or on society and which may, in fact, be maintained merely for the purpose of making substantial capitals gains some time in the future.  Capital gain is something which is charged only at the lowest rate of income tax at 26 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the difficulty. Once we start discussing wealth tax we find ourselves ending up with a whole mixture of different legislative proposals which are before the House and where I think it would be more relevant to discuss the particular issues which arose here.  This section seeks to alter the rates of income tax on income and for no other reason.  Apart from the wealth tax aspect, which I offered as one justification, there are other justifications for making these <Col N="1581" /> alterations, including the fact that Irish companies have to pay substantially higher incomes to top executives than they would have to pay in Britain in order that their employees would have the same take home pay.  This in itself generates envy and annoyance right down the line.</P>
      <P>As long as the moral of the labourer in the vineyard is with us and it is part of human nature for people to apply the same discipline and attitude to themselves you will always have people linking their expectations with what they see other people nominally being paid.  Nominal incomes in Ireland are, in fact, in real terms worth much less than in any other European country I know of because of the very high levels of tax associated with brackets of income, the thresholds of which are below those applicable in other countries.  In order to try to cool the situation for top executives' salary demands, which will have a beneficial effect I believe right down the line, we consider it is appropriate in the income front alone, if wealth tax were never to be contemplated, to make these adjustments in the thresholds and the rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made one of the most important and interesting statements that are likely to be made in this debate, although he is perfectly right that we should return to our muttons here on this Bill.  He found himself in the difficulty of not being able to disassociate himself from the various phases of his legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister said three things in the very important statement he made. I want to put it on record that I am not trying to catch the Minister on words but he spontaneously defined a philosophy approaching the whole question of the holding of wealth.  He has intimated a philosophy in regard to the ownership of property.  That can be agreed with in parts and disputed in other parts and perhaps from another point of view we can totally disagree with him.  The only thing to do, to save our rights and the Minister's rights, is to expand on that statement at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> I am not saying what I want to say in any spirit of threat or stirring up anything.  The first statement of the Minister with regard to the approach to wealth needs to be co-ordinated with the specific provisions of our Constitution in this regard.  It would be of some consequence if a constitutional conflict arose.  I know this is going a bit wide of the debate but it has a bearing on this section.  As Deputy Colley pointed out, there can be a compensatory factor.  If you tax property to the limit indicated by Deputy Colley, that is a confiscation.</P>
    <P>I make this point to suggest an idea, a danger or a problem that may arise.  I do not make it in the sense of an accusation against the Minister or an imputation of intent.  This needs to be read in conjunction with the Constitution.  You have wealth and you tax it beyond its capacity, so what is the remedy?  It is a confiscation. I merely mention this as a point of danger to keep in mind.  I am going beyond the bounds of order and I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to pursue it to this extent.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are, I am sure, very much concerned with their problems of collection.  There are certain areas where the revenue collecting authority must concentrate under particular difficulties.  The Minister himself has underlined and is perfectly correct to underline, the fact that, if companies or other employers collect PAYE, that is not their money, and that the Revenue Commissioners are absolutely right to make a priority of collecting that money.</P>
    <P>How do the Revenue Commissioners proceed in practice?  Legal actions are slow, costly, and give very little return.  Wherever there is a return it is through the use of the sheriff and the county registrar.  The Minister will have the statistics as to how often this arises, and I am inclined to think that if the figures were disclosed to the House they would reveal that it was surprisingly often that recourse was had to this mechanism.  One of the problems is the <i>nulla bona</i> return and the Minister, <Col N="1583" /> in his former civilian capacity, will know the risk of that procedure.</P>
    <P>I say this, I hope, in the most co-operative terms, but I want to warn that there is possibly a trap here. Both the Minister and Deputy Colley, who is leading from this side of the House on this matter, cannot avoid taking such matters into account in discussing this section.  It is not at all that one does not approve of much of the Minister's approach to this section.  I think Deputy Colley would be the first to say that the reliefs are compensatory.  I do not propose to talk for Deputy Colley, and he can disown me.</P>
    <P>That is the first point.  The second point is one I have made on practically every Bill here: one of our fundamental difficulties in constructively dealing with the whole tax code is that the Minister has brought it in piecemeal.  We are really dealing with an administrative revolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to expand too far on this.  However, let me say that here we are implementing a budget but there are three other Acts, to say the least of it, and I could add two more, and you may remember, Sir, that we had something on the Social Welfare Bill.  You cannot assess the value of a section like this without taking these considerations into account.  When you come to the very question the Minister raised on this, this part of it will be <i>factum</i>, and the elasticity or the compensation we could have if this thing were treated as a unified code is gone, with the disadvantage for the Minister as well as for us of having been committed rigidly, and at a later stage we may have a much smaller area of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is extremely relevant, and if a statement of philosophy is to be accepted, I should like to have my gloss on it recorded.  Even if the rules of order are technically and properly invoked to confine us in view of the way the thing has been done, let that not spoil the job the Minister is doing. <Col N="1584" /> I have criticised the Minister very severely on all this both in regard to the basic philosophy of his approach and because of the approach of his Government, and I shall do so again before the matter is finished.  However, we have at least a comprehensive effort on the Minister's part to deal with an overall financial structure.  Surely that is something this House ought to be able to debate without restriction, and the restriction that is being brought in stems, and stems only, from the manner in which it is presented to us.</P>
    <P>The last point the Minister made was in relation to comparison with other countries.  The Minister is perfectly right, but I think there was a slip of the tongue on the Minister's part when he mentioned public service. Let us get this in perspective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think I used the word.  Maybe I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>He did, and I am adverting to it because it was a slip of the tongue that probably indicated something, and there is no reason why that something should not be said. There was a time here when the top public servants here were inadequately paid.  There was the ridiculous situation up to recently where the levels of pay in industrial and other firms competing with those in Britain were inadequate. There is no need to gloss over or apologise for the higher levels granted to civil servants.  After all they are the senior executives of the biggest administration in the State.</P>
      <P>These are all reasons why these reliefs should be given.  Deputy Colley will probably press this point a little bit further.  I understand an amendment will be proposed to the table. Where economy is to be achieved in the public service is in efficiency and minimising the operation of Parkinson's law not in trying to depress either the status or the remuneration of the officers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is obviously not prepared to commit himself on this, but will he realise that when this is passed it is <i>factum</i> and that when we come to something else at a later stage the elasticity is gone?  Before we have finality here, is it too much to take <Col N="1585" /> the attitude Deputy Colley has taken and ask that the thing be looked at in its entirety and in that way find a better solution than in the mere myopic focusing on point by point as we go along?  It is like scrutinising the letters that make up a word instead of holding the paper back a bit and reading the word and the sentence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love to engage in a philosophical discussion, but we have a great deal of legislation to get through, and I shall have to leave the philosophical argument to another occasion.  However, I should like to bring the comment down to earth.  The only kind of case in which the total tax&mdash;income tax and wealth tax&mdash;would exceed 100 per cent of a person's income would be where the wealth consisted of £2 million and the income was only £10,000.  One would have very bad laws if one were to endeavour to enact legislation to deal with that kind of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that is the only situation that might be involved?  There are others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kind of extraordinary situation that could arise, having regard to our proviso that combined income tax and wealth tax shall not exceed 80 per cent provided always that the reduction should not exceed 50 per cent of the wealth tax which would otherwise be payable. In a situation of a person having assets worth £2 million but an income of only £10,000, it would be in his own interest for somebody to draw his attention to the foolish use of such wealth producing such inadequate income.  While we have no right to clobber people into acting in a common-sense way, it is not any disadvantage to such people to have their own folly pointed out to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments in regard to income tax are such as to ensure that people who are in these income brackets and who, in the past, have been taxed much more heavily here than their counterparts in comparable countries, will receive, under the income tax code, reliefs which are necessary both socially and economically.  Generally speaking, most such people being in the salary <Col N="1586" /> classes would not have substantial accumulations of wealth and unearned income.  However, supposing they had significant wealth in addition to their salaries, it would be interesting to note the amount of wealth they would need to have before, as a result of the wealth tax and income tax combined, they would be paying more tax than they were paying in the past.</P>
    <P>For a person with an income of £7,000, in addition to his home, its contents and the land around it, the figure would be £109,250.  A person with an income of £9,000 would need to have wealth in addition to the exemptions I have mentioned of £128,500 while the figure for a person on an income of £10,000 would be £142,750.  These are the realities of the situation.  I am not disagreeing with some of the philosophical approach of Deputy de Valera but when we come to deal with the hard facts we see that the provisions we are bringing in here will ensure that people in the income brackets we have been talking about will not be disadvantaged as a result of income tax and wealth tax combined and that the mass of people will receive significant relief.  As a consequence we will be in a position to remunerate public executives here on a level comparable with other countries.  Failure to make these amendments in the income tax code would compel us to pay our executives inflated figures in order to give them the same take home pay as their counterparts in other countries.</P>
    <P>I gather from what Deputy de Valera said that he would regard it as desirable to adjust these rates, which have led to a situation in which we, as a poor country with a small income <i>per capita</i>, have had to pay our top executives a much higher salary than is paid in other countries.  In so doing we drive others mad in seeking rewards at levels related to these high figures. I accept entirely what the Deputy said about our senior civil servants.  It is unfortunate that whenever adjustments are made in the salaries of people in top public positions they invariably generate envious comment without any rider being added that the income increases are subjected to a top tax of 80 per cent or, as it will be in the <Col N="1587" /> future, 70 per cent so that what seems to be an increase of £5 per week is in some cases only £1 per week.  It is unfortunate that tax position is not revealed at the same time as the gross increases are given because in this way a great deal of the envy and unfavourable comment might never be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>From that point of view the Minister, as a most responsible and senior executive of this State, is grossly underpaid.  However, let us get back to the type of case mentioned by the Minister.  But here, again, we are on a borderline case. Let us suppose that a man owns a substantial acreage of land which, taking inflation and so on into account, would be within the area the Minister is talking about.  If this man plants the land he may not get as much as £10,000 out of it for a few years.  But let us take the case of an energetic businessman.  Regardless of what may be said about them, there are <i>entrepreneurs</i> who, because of their energy and their readiness to take risks, have brought benefit to society and who, in a sense, have a big interest on which there is no immediate return.</P>
      <P>Within a very big business interest of importance to the community there might be a small consortium in respect of which the return would be deferred.  For example, let us take oil exploration.  In our case this will be a State enterprise but supposing there were a group developing oil resources, who could but deny that that group would be of benefit to the community?  However, people in that category might very easily find themselves in the sort of situation which both the Minister and Deputy Colley have outlined.  I am saying this merely to illustrate that the argument is not as simple as the Minister would indicate.  In so far as most ordinary mortals are concerned the Minister is right but the law must look further than that.  We must make good laws and should not take chances in enacting legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister's comments on reasons <Col N="1588" /> other than wealth tax implications for reducing the top rate of income tax.  I should not quarrel with the reasons he gave.  The overall economic effect in so far as this might reduce the level of executives' salaries or at least reduce the amount sought, could, as the Minister said, have its effect down the line and help to make our industry and business generally more competitive.  But I was interested because so far as I know this is the first time on which the Minister has referred to this aspect of it. Certainly, it is the first time he has referred to it in relation to the reduction of the top rate of income tax.</P>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge, any previous reference by him to the reduction of the top rates of income tax was tied in with the wealth tax proposals.  As I indicated, I would not quarrel with the reasons he gave not associated with the wealth tax.  The Minister has given the reasons associated with the wealth tax and, for the reasons I indicated earlier, there is a tie up between this section and the liability for annual wealth tax.</P>
      <P>I thought it would be self-evident that an annual rate of tax which exceeds a person's income was a bad thing, but it is clear from the Minister's reply that to him it is not necessarily a bad thing.  The Minister spoke rather blandly about this kind of arrangement operating in other countries and ensuring that people who had their money or assets badly invested would invest them more efficiently in order to get a bigger return to enable them to pay more tax.  There are a number of loopholes in that part of it, but I will not pursue them.  If people are to be induced, in the national interest, to invest more efficiently we should provide incentives.  But the proposition that they should be penalised by, as Deputy de Valera said, confiscating their property is one I cannot go along with.  If the Minister reflects on this I do not think he will go along with it either.  Yet the combination of the rates of tax proposed in this Bill with wealth tax in certain circumstances can result precisely in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> It is not good enough to take a particular example, as the Minister did. There are lots of other circumstances other than those he described where the situation could arise of more than 100 per cent of one's annual income being taken in tax.  If the only example was the one he mentioned, a fairly grotesque example, we still should not do what the Minister proposes.  We should not do it because it is wrong in principle and because, if that is accepted, what will happen when the thresholds are lowered or are not adjusted in line with inflation? We will then not have a handful, as envisaged by the Minister, but many people in the situation where they will be liable for more than their whole income each year.  It is so obvious to me that that is a bad proposition that I find it difficult to understand the Minister when he says he does not agree that it is a bad proposition.  I suggest that to deal with this situation this section ought to contain a provision the effect of which would be that, no matter what is contained otherwise in this Bill or in the Income Tax Acts, no taxpayer would be liable to tax at the rates prescribed by this section in combination with wealth tax in excess of 100 per cent of his income.  Anything over and above that is confiscation.</P>
    <P>To deal with this point provision should be made either in this section or in the Wealth Tax Bill.  I do not care in which Bill it is provided.  I am much more concerned with the principle involved, a principle that can lead to confiscation.  There is no use in the Minister trying to justify it on the grounds that people have invested their money inefficiently.  People can be induced to invest efficiently: but the proposition that because they are not investing their money efficiently their property is confiscated by charging more than 100 per cent of their income is one I do not go along with.  I believe that reflection on the implications of this should make it clear to every Member that this is something we should avoid no matter how few the number of cases in which it can happen, no matter how wealthy such people may be either by way of income or capital.  It is a wrong proposition <Col N="1590" /> and it should not be accepted.  If it is accepted it is only a matter of time until it is extended to many more people than it would apply to now.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to indicate &mdash;I do not care whether he is willing to do it on this section or on the relevant section of the Wealth Tax Bill&mdash; that he will accept the proposition that, whatever inducements he will provide for the more efficient investment of people's wealth, the combination of income tax under this section and wealth tax will not exceed 100 per cent of the taxpayer's income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the proposition being advanced that this income tax provision should be amended to provide that people of substantial wealth should pay a correspondingly small amount of income tax.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with a section which states what the levels of income tax should be.  The only relevant amendment here would be to say that people of substantial wealth who may be called upon to pay wealth tax should pay less income tax.  I cannot accept that that is a correct thing to do; neither do I accept that sane people do not adjust their wealth holdings and income arrangements in response to tax.  They do and they always have.  That is one of the reasons why people took avoidance action in respect of estate duty; they simply responded to the tax code.  It is most probable, because it has happened in other countries where wealth taxes were introduced, that people will adjust their wealth holdings so as to invest their wealth in assets which will give them an income sufficient to pay income tax and wealth tax.  That process operated to the benefit of the community as well as to the individuals concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the facts of economic history and they are the usual experiences in the fiscal field.  I cannot see that it is wrong to anticipate that the <Col N="1591" /> same wise moves might be indulged in by holders of wealth here.  We have debated this and it has been an interesting debate.  I would be prepared to entertain this debate further on the Committee Stage of the Wealth Tax Bill, but we are dealing with incomes here and we cannot change this section in any way except in relation to income tax.  We could not anticipate, as Deputy Colley pointed out earlier, the passing into law of the Wealth Tax Bill.  We may assume it may happen, and on the balance of probabilities it will, but for the purpose of passing this Finance Bill into law before the appointed date we cannot assume that wealth tax will exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand why the Minister thinks it is heresy to consider the proposition that a taxpayer who is paying both income tax and wealth tax would pay less income tax in order to ensure that he does not pay more than 100 per cent of his income in tax.  On the other hand the Minister provides in the Wealth Tax Bill that a person who is in that position will pay less wealth tax than another person.  Why one is heresy and the other is not I do not know.</P>
      <P>The reality of the situation is that we are dealing in this discussion with the combination of the two, where the person would be liable to both. I do not know why the Minister should find it so difficult to accept the proposition that a taxpayer should not be liable for annual tax in excess of his annual income.  It seems to me to be the kind of proposition which, when one thinks about it, one must accept unless one is prepared to go in for confiscation of property because one believes it is for the taxpayer's own good, so that he will invest his assets in a way that one, as Minister for Finance, considers is good as distinct from the stupid taxpayer who is doing it the wrong way.  This is a proposition that is going much too far.  It is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, in the interval which is about to occur, to <Col N="1592" /> think a little further about this and agree with the proposition that in no circumstances would the combination of the two taxes exceed 100 per cent of income whatever incentives he wants to provide for people to invest wisely.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to provide without delay adequate capitation grants and grants in lieu of fees for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the capitation grants are as follows: for junior pupils, maximum £19 <i>per capita,</i> reducing on a scale to £13 if the pupil has not full attendance, and for a senior pupil £24 reducing, again on a scale, to £15 if the pupil has not a fixed number of attendances, the number being fixed by the Department of Education.  The grant in lieu of fees, which the House will remember was initiated when Donogh O'Malley introduced his new scheme for free secondary education now stands at £35.  What we are calling on Dáil Éireann to do is to ask the Government to raise these grants to a realistic level.</P>
      <P>Last Tuesday the Taoiseach, in a reply to me, said that £25 in 1975 would buy the same <i>quantum</i> of goods and services as did £11.38 in 1967. According to that scale the grant in lieu of fees should be now almost £55.  That is what we are calling on the Government to pay as a grant in lieu of fees.  In 1967 the capitation grants for junior and senior pupils. repectively, were £14 and £19.  As I said at the outset, they are now £19 for junior and £24 for senior pupils at the maximum.  Using the same criterion they should be now £32 and £42 at the maxima respectively.</P>

    <P>It might be said that the consumer price index, upon which the Taoiseach's answer was based, was not particularly geared to school costs.  But I would submit that, due to <Col N="1593" /> what I can call only a savage increase in the price of heating and lighting for schools, to the galloping increase in social welfare charges&mdash; and the schools responsibility in this regard is greater than it ever was&mdash; due also to various factors, some of which I shall deal with later, the demand for part-time teachers is greater than ever before.  Bank interest is at a prohibitive rate, even if special concessions are granted, and they are not always given.  Also at present schools are charged with repaying bank loans, apart altogether from the interest. Therefore, a strong case could be made that the consumer price index gives a flattering picture and does not tell how severely school finances have been affected by inflation since 1967.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the financing of secondary schools, which is a pernicious one and one which the Minister might consider changing, is that grants are based on last year's pupils and are expected to pay this year's bills.  This may have been not quite so harmful when, for example, the number of admissions to secondary schools was stable, roughly equal from year to year, but since Donogh O'Malley's plan, this has changed radically and increased numbers come into the schools year after year.  Consequently the schools are in a very awkward position.  It is not impossible to pay the grants on the existing numbers but, needless to say, the system would require a good many changes. Other countries can do it and I do not see why we cannot.  Other education committees that deal with more pupil populations than the whole of this country can manage to pay on the current number of pupils rather than on those of the preceding year.</P>
    <P>The second factor which makes this a source of great hardship for the schools, of course, is the one I mentioned already&mdash;inflation.  When money was not getting out of hand, when inflationary tendencies were not as they are today, it was not quite so harmful to school financing.  Since inflation has taken this whole country by the ear, it is a serious factor in the financing of the schools.  I am asking the Minister to remove this <Col N="1594" /> aggravating factor, if at all possible, when he is raising both the capitation grant and the grants in lieu of fees.</P>
    <P>There is&mdash;and this House knows it &mdash;considerable alarm about the finances of secondary schools.  Members of this House have been getting letters and documents.  They have been summoned to attend meetings.  The parlous position of the schools has been outlined to them in the media.  I am not so sure that the campaign started in time but the idea is getting through now. When you hear school managers, who were basically conservative, talking about withdrawal of labour or closing down, it is time the Minister wakened up and it is time that he faced whoever is responsible for the lack of response in so far as school finance is concerned.</P>
    <P>The President of the INTO said that the Government were regarding education as a soft area in which it was easy to make economies.  It has been said in reply to that that the action of the Government, who are responsible to this House, was simply what the people wanted because no politician would do what he feared would lose support and votes for him.  Anyone who is in any way attuned to public opinion cannot possibly hold that that is so.  The people are crying out for extra finance in the fields mentioned by me for secondary education and it is the duty of the Government to provide it for them.  I repudiate that statement.  Those who are reading public opinions are reading it improperly if they are reading it as being indifferent to school financing.  I understand that the Minister stood over that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A very important office holder in the association whose conference the Minister was attending assured me that the Minister stood over the statement made by this official at a conference in Cork.  Was any social survey carried out?  What kind of dipping into public opinion was done in order to ascertain this lack of interest on the part of the people in the financing of secondary schools?  I contend that no such survey was carried out <Col N="1595" /> and that this, from a man who has spent his life in education, was a pardonably cynical remark, perhaps, meant to stir up people to their responsibility and to indicate to the people responsible that secondary education should be adequately financed.</P>
      <P>This House must highlight the concern of the people in this regard by passing this motion calling on the Government to increase adequately the grants in lieu of fees and the capitation grant.  This House must live up to its responsibility to the people to let the Government know they are concerned and that people are joining organisations and attending committee meetings in order to let the Government know of their concern.</P>
      <P>As I said, basically conservative managerial organisations are coming into the public forum to talk on this matter.  They are talking about bankruptcy. They are talking about the danger of schools closing down.  The people are getting the message if the mail I am getting and the demands to attend meetings are any indication of what the people want.  We are calling on the Minister to come into this House and do the just thing by the secondary schools by way of a supplementary estimate.  I know he is as convinced as I am that they need this money and all he needs is the will and the strength to extract it from the Government and give it to the people who deserve it and are in sore need of it.</P>
      <P>One of the most disturbing things about this whole business at present is the shirking of responsibility, what I called already a kind of ping-pong morality on the part of the Government. The Department of Education are blaming the Department of Finance and the Department of Finance are ponging the ball back to the Department of Education and, in the meantime, the schools are waiting for their finances and not getting them. This is a despicable mode of procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the serious situation in secondary schools came up at a meeting of Monaghan County Council recently when a proposal was put to the council that rates on secondary <Col N="1596" /> schools should be abolished.  As reported in the <i>Anglo-Celt</i> of 11th April, 1975, Deputy Toal said a national compaign was going on about secondary school finances and the Minister was fully aware of the situation and was bringing all pressure to bear on the Government.  Are the Government resisting that pressure?  Is there any sign of the Government yielding to that pressure?</P>
    <P>Surely the Government have enough confidence in the Minister for Education to respect his judgment when he asks them for adequate grants in lieu of fees and capitation grants.  Why are they not supplying the money?  Why are they not delivering the goods?  Is the Minister not able to carry his colleagues with him?  Obviously, so far as delivering the money to the schools is concerned he is not.  Wherever the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education want to place the blame, I place it fairly and squarely on the man who is charged with responsibility for looking after education, the Minister for Education.  It is his duty to convince the Government&mdash;and they should not need convincing&mdash;of the importance of education and the importance of these schools in our community and, having convinced them, to extract from them the necessary grants.</P>
    <P>The statement in Cork and the Minister's statement on school management in Galway were diversionary tactics to take people's minds away from the need for adequate finance for secondary schools.  Indeed, the production of the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Bill like a &ldquo;myxo&rdquo; rabbit out of a Christie hat during the week may have been part of the same exercise to take people's minds off the real crisis at the moment which is in our secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I want to call the attention of the House to the fact that the salaries of secondary school teachers are paid from the capitation grant.  Since 1924 when the grant was introduced this was understood to be part of the function of the fund.  Would the managerial bodies say at the moment that, with the school salaries as they are now, all the capitation grant is taken <Col N="1597" /> up by salaries?  The original intention behind the capitation grant was that the school salary would be only half of what it had to finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be weak in his approach in this matter.  This very week a ukase has gone out from the Department of the Public Service which will hit the school funds again; funds that cannot bear their existing burden will have another burden laid on top of them.  No new appointments in secondary schools.  What is the school to do which has already contracted to take in 60 or 70 and, in one case not far from the city of Dublin, 150 new pupils this year? There is no money in the capitation grant fund to pay teachers fully.  The Department of the Public Service says no new teachers are to be employed. So I understand.  This has not been denied.  In 1974-75 X teachers; in 1975-76 X teachers.  This is how the story runs.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to adopt a serious approach to the Minister for Finance and make up his mind what he will do.  Since the 1939-45 was most of the work in education was dedicated to the principle of equality of opportunity.  That was the case in Europe and outside it.  That principle is in retreat here at the moment.  I submit it is in retreat because of the weakness of the Minister in confrontation with the Minister for Finance. There are suggestions that parents will be called upon to contribute. This House should repudiate that approach.  Parents should not be called upon to pull the Minister's chestnuts out of the fire by forking out money to the schools.  If this is the evolution, then it is the thin end of the wedge and the principle of equality of opportunity will be riven asunder. This should add a final edge to the Minister's sword.  There is a principle at stake and if the Minister allows that principle to go, then the underprivileged will suffer again because what will be available to them in education will be a great deal less than their entitlement.  Not only will the children of the poorer sections suffer but so also will the children of the selfish.  This is something I came up <Col N="1598" /> against in my teaching career; if parents feel they have to pay, they will not allow their children to continue in education.</P>
    <P>What approaches have been made? The managerial bodies, whose responsibility it is to run the schools, have not been as good, perhaps, as they might have been in telling the people what exactly they have been doing. In September, 1973, an application was made by the joint managerial body for an increase in capitation grant.  No luck.  No response.  On 30th April, 1974, the CMCSS appealed for an increase in capitation and grants in lieu of fees.  No result.  In May, 1974, the Minister for Education was asked for an early decision.  He gave none, unless one regards doing nothing as giving a decision.  The two education commissions, with interests in the managerial bodies, employed an accountant to do a scientific assessment of secondary school costs.  September, 1974, dawned with no increase granted in the capitation grant; £5 <i>per capita</i> were added to the grant in lieu of fees.  A case was presented again in November, 1974.  Incidentally, at some of these meetings both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education were present. On 10th January, 1975, people called on the Minister for Education or on the Department for an answer to the request made by the previous deputation. No increase in capitation grant and no increase in the grant in lieu of fees.</P>
    <P>All this was going on without the public knowing.  Perhaps the public thought the managerial bodies were coming in rather late when they should have been agitating for some time.  Their approach was to present a reasoned and scientifically constructed case to the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance in the hope that results I would follow.  Obviously, nothing worthwhile followed and, as a result, the managers have had to take the people into their confidence, tell them about their troubles and ask them to get in touch with public representatives to do something about the serious position in which they find themselves. <Col N="1599" /> I might add here that the remote areas grant and the island grants also need to be updated, although they are not specifically mentioned in the motion.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to like indulging in the barren exercise of creating antagonism between the various post-primary schools.  Nothing comes of this.  All schools should be realistically financed&mdash;the community school, the comprehensive school and the secondary school.  Many vocational committees are in debt.  Community schools need more money.  Comprehensives need more money.  <i>A fortiori,</i> the secondary schools need more money.</P>
    <P>There is another pressure on the capitation grant fund for which the Minister must assume responsibility. Certain schools had set up remedial teaching, which is absolutely essential nowadays with the varied intake into schools.  Through a change in regulations the Minister has in certain circumstances left schools without remedial teachers.  In certain circumstances they will have to be absorbed into the joint staff of the school.</P>
    <P>It was the greatest effrontery for the Minister for Education to go to the ASTI conference and express an interest in remedial teaching.  What must the schools do now?  If they want remedial teachers, they will have to pay the full salary out of a fund which does not exist because there will be no money in that fund for the various purposes it was intended to cover.  We must remember that the figures I have given are not figures which, if granted, would show any great improvement in the funding of these schools.  They are merely figures that would help the schools to keep pace with increases in the cost of living, with the inflationary crisis. They would at least provide decent libraries in these schools.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister a question some time ago about library grants. It is not a wild claim to ask for a £55 grant because that would not be an improvement&mdash;it would be just keeping pace.  We are asking for an increase in the capitation grants to <Col N="1600" /> £32 and £42 maxima respectively.  I am convinced that the Minister for Education is as convinced as I am of this need.  He will have to deal with the problem in his own way. Perhaps he can jolly the Cabinet along in some way, by putting his arm on Justin's shoulders or around Conor's neck.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister's personality is not that way inclined, but one cannot sit on Mount Olympus and achieve anything except a frozen rump.  One must come down and tackle the problem in one's own way.  The Minister for Education will be remembered not for the elegance of his diction or his <i>jeu d'esprit</i>, not for keeping a rickity Coalition together, but for allowing his Department to be under-financed&mdash;not through his yielding to imaginary higher priorities because he, above all, must know there is no higher priority than education.</P>
      <P>No Government should be allowed to survive on another man's wound, least of all if that man is the Minister for Education.  However, it is not the wound of the Minister for Education alone but of the pupils, the young men who will be facing the next century inadequately equipped.  I am suggesting to the Minister that he should beard the Minister for Finance in his den and get money for this social priority, a priority as big as the social welfare area.  This is his plain duty, unvarnished and I am calling on him to fulfil that duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long contended that in the field of education the best value for money has been received by the State. I have chosen my words deliberately. There were many gross inadequacies but relative to the money spent, education has served the country marvellously. With that knowledge and belief and conviction, the Minister for Education must now establish his right to the Department of Finance : he must walk into the Department of Finance for his money; he must be prepared <Col N="1601" /> to throw his portfolio at them rather than let them away with this criminal proceeding of under financing education. If the hand is in every man's pocket let what every man pays be placed where the need is greatest. The Minister has spoken of his dedication to the maintenance of the morale of this sector of education.  I believe he was genuine in what he said, but there is no greater way to establish the morale of his Department than to stand up to the Department of Finance and extract the money necessary for that Department to do their duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to give my views on this subject, which warrants consideration at this time.  Most of us will be aware of the public agitation for these increases. The parents and teachers and religious bodies who run the schools have found it necessary to take action to ensure that something is done because there is a great danger of schools closing down.  If that were to happen we would be in a very serious position.</P>
      <P>The religious bodies have found themselves overtaken by inflation and are heavily in debt and they have felt themselves justified in explaining to parents the financial situation in which their schools have been placed.  When the scheme was introduced in 1967, I believe the Minister for Education, the late Donogh O'Malley, although it was his courageous step that introduced free education, did not realise the demands that would be made on the service.  It was a rather shortsighted thing on the part of the then Government not to have made provision for the obvious increasing demands.  There has been a massive increase in the number of students but meanwhile nothing substantial has been done to provide for increases in costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will explain the difficulties as I see them, and I thank St. John's College in Ballyfermot for information on this.  In 1969 the capitation grant was £22 and it is still £22, although the cost of living index which was 100 in 1967 was 180 in 1974.  If the capitation grant had been increased accordingly it would now be £39.60 instead of £22. It is important to remember that the <Col N="1602" /> basic salary paid by the schools to the teachers increased in 1969 and the capitation grants received by the schools has been spent on paying the basic salary.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are not in a position to denounce the Government&mdash;I am speaking objectively&mdash;because they are not without blame.  In 1967 the grant in lieu of fees was £25 and this was increased in 1971 by Fianna Fáil to £30. This was a 20 per cent increase but the cost of living had increased by 46 per cent.  It is not just Fianna Fáil or the Government who are to blame; all of us are at fault because we have not given education the number one priority it deserves.  Investment in education is a sound investment and every child has a fundamental right to it. We are bottom of the league in the EEC countries in the proportion of the gross national product we devote to education, and all of us must accept blame.</P>
    <P>As money is not available from capitation grants to pay for heating and lighting these costs are now to be paid out of grants in lieu of fees.  This is an important point and it explains the difficulties of many schools.  There is also the matter of the weekly social insurance payments of £3 per teacher, which amount to £156 per year.  For example, in a school of 27 teachers this will be an extra burden of £4,200 and it explains in part why the schools are in such difficulty.  There is the question of the additional substitutes who must be employed because of a deterioration in the pupil-teacher ratio and there is also the question of the rate for part-time teachers which has increased significantly.  In addition, schools have to bear the burden of rates and the greatest burden of all is the cost of heating and lighting. All these factors have contributed to the dreadful situation in schools today.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education have suffered badly <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other Departments in getting their rightful share.  Some figures I have here will explain what has happened.  In a comparison with the Department of Health I found the Department of Education fared very badly.  In comparison with the figure for 1970-71, <Col N="1603" /> there has been an increase of 150 per cent but the Department of Health had an increase of 296.64 per cent and the Department of Social Welfare had a 144 percentage increase.  The Department of Education have not got their rightful share of the cake and, even though I am a doctor, I must point out they have fared very badly <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Department of Health.  Education is of prime importance but it appears we are not prepared to give it sufficient resources. I realise we are in a difficult situation. The economy is not as sound as we would wish and we are facing hard times.  However, the Government have an obligation to provide money for education, and if they do not do so a number of schools may close.</P>
    <P>We have taken for granted religious teaching in our schools; in fact, we have almost thrown the whole burden on the shoulders of the religious orders.  That may have been all right when the economy was relatively stable and when inflation was not so high.  The religious orders were able to manage and did not come crying to the legislators for help.  They managed and were very quiet about it and we must also pay tribute to them for this. We must also pay tribute to them for the years they have given to the education of the children.  I am glad to say I am a product of their work. They gave me completely free education and I would not have got beyond primary school were it not for the religious orders.  I would not be a doctor today were it not for their help.  Therefore, I feel justified in paying tribute to them.  We have an obligation to tell them that they may continue their good work but that we will make sure we pay them to keep the schools open.  They do not want the money for themselves; it is all in the interests of education.</P>
    <P>I differ with the religious orders on many points.  For instance, I do not agree with them on the management of schools; but I understand they accept the principle of sharing management with parents and this is very desirable.  Education is changing rapidly and they are more than meeting <Col N="1604" /> this change.  I had cause to say otherwise on occasions but, having regard to the way they are relieving the Government and the country of such a burden in providing education, I feel obliged to pay tribute to them. If we were to substitute something else for them, I do not think we would have a properly organised system.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to two schools which are in difficulties.  One school is Caritas College, Ballyfermot, where the income is £13,000 and the outgoings more than £29,000&mdash;the deficit is nearly £17,000.  I am sure all Members will agree with me that the college will be bankrupt in a few years if they continue at this rate.  When I got the figures for another school in my area I was astounded.  I am referring to St. Dominick's secondary school, which will not be able to continue for very long at the present rate.  We have an obligation to help them and at the very least to ensure that the grants keep pace with inflation. I am making a special plea to the Government and the Minister for Finance to give the Minister for Education the money that is needed.  Even if it means we must have a supplementary budget we should provide the money that is necessary.  People must realise that the provision of education costs money.  As I said last night, it will not be manna from heaven, the public must provide it.  They must be told exactly what it is for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Minister intervened after the principal speaker it would have helped the discussion quite considerably.  Because I have to speak before him, I should like to refer to the usual public relations act in one of the Sunday papers, where it was said it was understood that the amount of money to be made available would be £1,500,000, which would be approximately £10 extra per child. <Col N="1605" /> I want to say in advance that if that is what the Minister is going to propose, it is not nearly enough and that it is not sufficient for him to point to the amount being spent by the Coalition on education as compared with what was spent by Fianna Fáil unless he relates that to the shocking inflation which we are experiencing now.</P>
      <P>As can be seen clearly from the goal set and the accomplishment education was a top priority with Fianna Fáil Governments.  We recognised that education was the great equaliser, that it was through education that the underprivileged in our society could be raised to an equal status with the remainder of society and that it was through education that we could fulfil our constitutional obligation to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  Those in need in our society can be, and have been helped by all Governments in various other ways but, to a considerable extent, these ways are only a stopgap and simply endeavour to ensure that such people living in such circumstances have the wherewithal to keep going.  But the fruits of education ensure that they have the opportunity to break out of the bonds that bind them.  The motivation which education inspires assists them to take their rightful place in society.</P>
      <P>In my view, every child has the right to have his aptitudes and abilities developed to their full potential. It was because of this basic philosophy that Fianna Fáil, during the late fifties and the sixties laid the groundwork which resulted in the introduction of the free, post-primary education scheme in 1967.  It was because of this philosophy that this development continued while Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the free education scheme, and the free transport scheme which was a necessary corollary to it was known to the Government at the time they took the decision.  This matter was carefully considered and the Government realised that it would take a very considerable amount of money to operate the scheme.  Money, never very plentiful, was scarce then but Fianna Fáil recognised that this <Col N="1606" /> nation could not afford to adopt a parsimonious attitude when dealing with its most valuable asset, our children. We proceeded with the free post-primary education scheme and added to it grants for third level education.</P>
    <P>The scheme was an exceptional success from the outset.  From a situation where a very limited number of children passed from primary to post-primary schools we had a change to where the vast majority of our young people continued their education in post-primary schools and a very considerably increased number of them passed into third level education either at university level or on the technological side.</P>
    <P>So great was that change that when I raised the school leaving age from 14 to 15 I discovered that the extra number of pupils to be catered for was relatively small because by that time a big majority of the children between 14 and 15 had already passed into post-primary schools.  We had, therefore, reached a situation where young boys and girls were achieving heights undreamed of by their parents; social barriers were being broken down and equality was evolving in the only way in which it can really evolve&mdash;through an educational system open to all.  Much more remained to be done before we reached the goal of providing equality of educational opportunity for all our children but a firm foundation had been laid and excellent progress made.</P>
    <P>Of necessity, that trend continued for some time after the Coalition had come into office but now that trend is reversed.  I cannot pretend that I am really surprised at the change of emphasis, at the failure of the Coalition to accept education as a priority. The never-to-be-forgotten television debate on education in which the late Donogh O'Malley and the then Fine Gael spokesman on education took part, in which Donogh O'Malley charged the Fine Gael Party with having no interest in education and with having issued a policy document in which the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; was never used&mdash;this underlined the attitude of that party to educational development. Today we see the Fine <Col N="1607" /> Gael Party reverting to type by refusing to make sufficient funds available for education in general and particularly in the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>This latter development has resulted in the introduction of fees in some form or other and under whatever guise it will ultimately deny the right of the poorer section of the community to a proper education.  This is a calamity not only for the children but also for the nation.  The principle that each child whether he is the most brilliant student in the university or a mentally handicapped child has the right to have whatever talents God gave him fully developed is one which the people of this country should jealously guard.  The day on which it is no longer accepted is the day on which we return to the old, elitist system which we in Fianna Fáil had hoped was buried forever.  I very much fear we are now backtracking. When the free education scheme was introduced secondary schools were requested to join it and after considerable discussion and negotiation, particularly in relation to grants in lieu of fees, the vast majority of these schools entered the scheme and free post-primary education was made available to all who wished to avail of it, which meant the vast majority of our young people.</P>
    <P>The secondary school authorities rightly expected that the Government would ensure that they were financed to the extent necessary to ensure the proper running of their schools.  During our term of office we had many discussions with the authorities concerned and grants were increased when the necessity arose.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend that the secondary school authorities were always satisfied with the financial aid granted to them but nothing ever arose which even remotely approached the present very serious situation.  From what I can remember of the discussions, apart from the time when we did increase the grants during my term of office, most of the discussions related to the financing of what we might call peripheral matters.  When I compare this situation with the chronic money shortage which now has many schools <Col N="1608" /> on the verge of bankruptcy, I have no doubt that the school authorities who thought they had problems then would be very glad if the good old days were back.</P>
    <P>Again let me refer to the fact, as I did in a previous speech, that the principle of collective responsibility has been jettisoned by the present Government.  This is very serious; it is fundamental to our democratic way of life.  We have known that it was jettisoned for quite some time, particularly in relation to the vote on a particular Bill.  The new Coalition philosophy seems to be: take no responsibility and blame whomsoever you can.  In pursuance of this policy we had the spectacle of the Minister for Education going on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; to explain how anxious he was to develop education but that the big, bad wolf, the Minister for Finance, would not give him the money and it was hoped that the people, having listened to the Minister, would convince the Minister for Finance that he should open the purse strings and make the money available. In my view, this whole farce was an abysmal abdication of responsibility on the part of the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>It is his duty to convince all his colleagues&mdash;not just the Minister for Finance&mdash;by force of argument that more money should be made available for one of the most important Government services.  But it is obvious that instead of fighting the cause of the youth of this country, he acquiesced in the spending of moneys on more popular, vote-catching, short-term projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Wilson mentioned, this was borne out by certain statements made recently.  I am convinced that the stunting which went on between <Col N="1609" /> the various Ministers was a put up job to confuse the public and convince them that the Minister for Education, who would normally be available to them, was the &ldquo;goodie&rdquo;, and the Minister for Finance, whom they could not as a rule reach, was the &ldquo;baddie&rdquo;.  In this way hopefully the pressure would be taken off the Minister for Education, and possibly the Government.  I can assure the Minister that the people are concerned only with ensuring that their schools are properly maintained and their children's education is uninterrupted. They have little time for the type of playacting we have seen over the last while.</P>
    <P>On the 25th July, 1974, in Volume 274, column 2293 of the Official Report, the Minister for Education said:</P>
    <P>It has become traditional to pay tribute to the extent of the voluntary aid to education in Ireland, particularly at second level, but it is now being borne in upon us as never before how much of a hard fact of economic life we would have to face without that aid.  I, for one, will do my utmost to retain that aid and to preserve as far as possible the morale of those who mainly provide it.</P>
    <P>Now we must take note of the remarkable manner in which the Minister proposes to preserve the morale of those mainly providing that aid, that is, the voluntary secondary schools. In accordance with the philosophy of the Coalition, this can best be done by permitting them to go to the verge of bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson has already dealt with capitation grants.  Grants in lieu of fees stood at a total of £47 in 1967. Today, 1975, the total stands at £57. I will not go into the details of the cost of living because we all know how much it has risen over the past few years.  Indeed, it could be said that not one week passes without an enormous increase in the cost of living. On this basis, the total fees would need to be increased to about £90. That would mean that the schools would be able merely to continue but <Col N="1610" /> it would not help them very much more than that.</P>
    <P>The Government are responsible&mdash; as was pointed out by Deputy O'Connell&mdash;for much of the extra expense which schools are now incurring. For example, social insurance payments were forced on them a few years ago and they have been increased considerably this year.  Extra substitutes must be employed because of the deteriorating pupil-teacher ratio.  Part-time teachers' costs have been increased to £2.40 per hour and the schools must meet the total cost of part-time teachers.  Rates have increased very considerably, and of course, the cost of heating and lighting has more than doubled.  Therefore, the voluntary secondary schools and their pupils are in a very serious predicament.</P>
    <P>The schools are faced with a number of options, if they are unable to obtain sufficient State aid.  They can opt out of the free education scheme and charge fees.  They can close down for a month to save money.  They can close down altogether or remain in the scheme in the hope that they will get finance from some other source.  The first option would mean the end of the free post-primary scheme because we would be back to a fee paying situation with the resultant loss to the vast majority of the young people who could no longer get post-primary education because of lack of means.  The second option would have very serious consequences for those doing examinations. To close down altogether would have the same effect as the changing back to the fee paying system.  More than likely the Minister and his Department would be forced to take over these schools and run them at greater expense than at present.  The fourth option would mean continuing in the scheme but obtaining money from the parents. In the short term this is the one which the voluntary schools and the parents might be most likely to choose.  In my view, this is the most dangerous and insidious of the choices because it means a return to the fee paying situation by a subterfuge, with the concealed blessing of the Minister.  I object strongly to this procedure.  I <Col N="1611" /> have no doubt that where parents decide to subscribe voluntarily, they will do so, firstly through loyalty to a school which has served their interests very well over the years and, secondly, because it directly affects their children's future.  Even if the subscription were to cause severe hardship, they would struggle to pay it.  Of course, human nature being what it is, we all know that many people who agree to pay will drop off, eventually.  This will mean that the schools will be worse off than ever. I want to underline the fact that I am not blaming the schools.  They are in this shocking situation because the money was not made available by the Department and the Government.</P>
    <P>In my view, the principle is entirely wrong.  Our children are entitled to education, whatever their parents' financial circumstances.  Fianna Fáil committed the State to providing free post-primary education.  We are determined that this Government, which seems to be a mixture of pseudo-socialism and rank conservatism will not be permitted to wreck the future of the poorer sector of this community. Once the fee paying system is reintroduced, no matter what the circumstances, the many who might benefit under the present system, but who could not afford an education otherwise, will be left out in the cold, and we will return to the old middle class elitist set-up which we hoped was gone forever.</P>
    <P>While I was Minister for Education, if any school in the free scheme asked parents to voluntarily subscribe to school funds for any purpose, I was immediately deluged with Dáil questions and protests by the Labour Party, particularly their then spokesman for Education, aided and abetted by the so-called liberal faction of the Fine Gael Party.  It is remarkable that not one of them has even squeaked about the present situation where schools are forced, through lack of State funds, to appeal for voluntary subscriptions.  The only conclusion I can come to is that a couple of years in office appears to be sufficient to turn rip-roaring socialists into meek and mild conservatives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> When we were in office we reminded the schools that they could not remain in this scheme if they collected money directly from parents.  Now that these once vocal Deputies are in power and one would assume that they are in a position to influence Government policy they have disappeared from the educational scene.  The only excuse that could conceivably be made for them is that they, like the rest of the people of this country, do not know what the Government educational policy is.  I cannot understand why they should have been so concerned about this matter when we were in office but today they do not show the least interest in the situation.  I have often wondered if there is another reason.</P>
    <P>Many of the voluntary schools are run by the religious.  Would it be true to say that the object of certain Ministers and Deputies is to force the religious out of education?  I do not include the Minister for Education in this.  His statements tend to show him as erring in the other direction.  Unfortunately for the future of Irish education, the recent discussions on third level proposals show that we have not any one person who has the power or responsibility to take basic decisions on education.  We all know that the proposals on third level education which emanated from the Minister's office, were brushed aside by a triumvirate in the Cabinet.  I do not have any reason to believe that these people have not their fingers in the present pie.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that when I was Minister for Education I did not always see eye to eye with the religious nor, indeed, they with me.  I want now to put on record, as I did previously, that I have a very great respect not only for the exceptional work the religious have done in the educational field in the past but also for what they are doing in education today and what I have no doubt they will contribute with equal dedication in the future.  I wonder if the same can be said for all the members of the present Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Again referring to the public relations act in which it was said that the Minister might chide Fianna Fáil <Col N="1613" /> with wanting to create community schools in lieu of other schools, I want to point this out: anybody who reads my speeches will see that I said on many occasions that what I was concerned about was comprehensive education and that comprehensive education could be provided in secondary schools, vocational schools, comprehensive schools or community schools, provided the schools were large enough to make available the wide variety of courses necessary to develop the aptitudes and abilities of all the pupils.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to a specific case.  It is the Christian Brothers secondary school in Dundalk, where I had the good fortune to get my own education.  The total income which this school will receive this year is £20,000, all of it from the Department of Education.  The expenditure is as follows:</P>

    <P>The total income is £20,000, which leaves a deficit of £6,800 and to this has to be added the bank interest on the debt incurred when the new secondary school was built.  This amounts to £7,000, leaving a total deficit of £13,800 for this year.  The Christian Brothers in Dundalk, when faced with bankruptcy because of this intolerable burden, decided it was impossible for them in the circumstances to carry on. The parents' committee were advised of the situation and to say they were shocked would be to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>The parents' committee called a meeting for all the parents of the pupils attending the school to explain the position to them and to point out what the alternatives were.  The parents decided on their own volition they would contribute voluntarily £10 each for the first year pupils, £20 each for second year pupils and £30 each <Col N="1614" /> for third year or higher pupils with the maximum of £30 per household. That is why I am telling the Minister that if his offer is £10 per pupil it is completely inadequate.</P>
    <P>Those parents agreed on this course of action unanimously out of respect for a very great school and in the interests of their children.  It is completely at variance with the free post primary education scheme that these parents should have to pay the money. The extra cost in this school and in the other voluntary secondary schools should be a general charge payable from State funds.  We have the Government over the past few months pretending, through their many taxation proposals, that they are spreading the tax load.  In this instance they are conniving at the narrowing of the taxation base where the load is being forced on to the parents, many of whom are unable to pay.  They feel, however, that their children's education is at stake and, also, because of their attachment to a school which has served Dundalk well for over a century, that whatever the sacrifice they must find the money.</P>
    <P>The whole free post-primary scheme is at a crossroads and the public should be made fully aware of what is happening.  The Minister claims he cannot get the money from the Minister for Finance.  He has conveyed this information to the schools and to the public.  The pressure is now on the schools and on the parents of the children in these schools to get the money elsewhere.  The only alternative source of revenue, as I pointed out, is from the parents' pockets.  The parents are now beginning to pay out in a situation which they hope will only be a temporary one.  Of course, the facts are and, the Minister well knows, that when the Government succeed in establishing a second source of revenue they will continue it.  We have had many instances of temporary taxes being introduced but very few of them were ever repealed.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the old <i>élite</i> system, which discriminated to such a degree against the disadvantaged in our community, is on its way back, let me add, under an administration in which <Col N="1615" /> the Labour Party play a big role.  The fulminations of the Labour Party and of pseudo-Liberals of the Fine Gael Party when in Opposition against what they like to term the conservatism of the Fianna Fáil education policy is now seen for what I always knew it to be.  On this side of the House we are determined to ensure that the free education scheme is not tampered with and also to ensure that the child in the disadvantaged family will have, as of right, the opportunity to have his God-given talents developed to the full.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that the introduction of the free education scheme did very much more, in my estimation, than simply help to pay for the poor boy or girl through the post-primary system.  I think it will be agreed that in many of our towns, due to the very low fees which were charged in Christian Brothers Schools and other schools run by religious, we had what was tantamount to being in so far as those towns were concerned, free education.  I feel the introduction of the free education scheme by the late Donogh O'Malley created a climate which showed those who never had the opportunity of post-primary education or who never thought of it for themselves, that education was a very desirable thing, that it was there for their children as well as the children of the rich and middle classes, that it was theirs as of right.  I must compliment the people of the country for the manner which they grasped the opportunity which Donogh O'Malley gave them.</P>
    <P>Our schools are now full of young people coming from all walks of life and the rung on which a child enters society because of parentage is no longer the criterion as to whether or not he progresses in life afterwards. Fianna Fáil worked hard and long over many years and we overcame very many obstacles to reach the present position.  There is undoubtedly very much more to be done before our system is as nearly perfect as it is possible to make it in this imperfect world.  To see the whole scheme in danger of collapsing&mdash;I must say it <Col N="1616" /> has already gone into reverse&mdash;is a source of very considerable sorrow to me and I have no doubt to the members of my party who have been responsible for doing so much in the field of post primary education over the years.</P>
    <P>It is only by clearly identifying the present Coalition moves and their effect and by presenting the real facts to the public that disaster can be averted.  The public must take a hand and demand that the necessary finance is made available and ensure that the necessary education facilities be made available to all the children of the nation.  I hope when the Minister is replying he will not waste the time of the House by simply quoting the amount spent at the present time on education and comparing it with what was spent during our time, because that is not relevant.  We know we are passing through a highly inflationary situation, much of which is caused by the Government, and to endeavour to even compare these figures would necessitate discussing the various increases which have taken place over the past two years.  As Deputy Wilson pointed out, it is not even sufficient simply to refer to the cost of living index, although it is one aspect we could concern ourselves with, but there are so many other factors involved as well.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely vital, if we are to ensure that the underprivileged get a chance, that sufficient money be made available immediately.</P>
    <P>When free education and free transport were introduced in the early sixties I did not think that was the beginning and the end of it and that we had solved the problem.  I recognised when I was Minister there was very much more to do and that we had to make the facilities available to the underprivileged in such a way they could avail themselves of the opportunities provided.</P>

When we hear talk of secondary and voluntary schools being in trouble, I believe Deputies have an obligation to ensure that the <Col N="1617" /> necessary finance is available.  This can only be done by voting for it in the House.  In the budget the Opposition voted against the tax that the Government levied on cigarettes and drink.  They are opposing progressive tax legislation here, and they were talking about gimmickry.</P>

      <P>When moneys were required for housing and other important welfare items they were opposed by the Opposition.  If we want to raise further taxation for education they oppose it?  They talk about free education and free transport.  There is nothing free.  It is all paid for, and this is why tax reform is needed, to make a greater spread so as to ensure that the load is borne evenly throughout society.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to reverting to the élitist system of education. I believe we never left it, that it is still with us.  If the figures for third level education and universities are checked, it will be found which strata of society these people come from and whether we are in that élitist situation. Again in regard to primary education, we have raised the school leaving age, but we have not structured that side of education to meet that situation.  That has not been adverted to by the people who were talking about élitism, because the people who suffer most under that system are the less well off in our society who are, unfortunately, the least vocal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, getting back to the voluntary schools, great credit is due to the religious in our society for their dedicated work over the years.  Deputy Faulkner made the innuendo that these schools might be deliberately run down to push them out of business. That is ludicrous.  Because of <Col N="1618" /> their dedication and the opportunity they have given to people to further their education, there is no such thought.  Our concern would be to examine the situation, and, if these schools have problems, to look at them and ensure that any necessary finances are given to them.  Such moneys would have to be voted through this House.  I am not the Minister for Finance and I cannot say whether, if moneys are to be made available, where they will come from. It does not grow on trees and a supplementary estimate may be needed. That means additional taxation.  If additional taxation is required, I would hope that the Opposition would welcome this.  If they did not, they would be less than honest in debating this motion.</P>
    <P>The Opposition, in their contribution here tonight, have highlighted the seriousness of the situation, but it is not as serious as they make it out to be.  Nobody will deny that there are problems due to the inflationary situation, and even the additional money given has been eaten up by inflation. The Opposition have a responsibility here as well.  If we neglect education, we neglect our future.  In the competitive world in which we live today and because of our role in Europe, we must ensure that our educational system is structured to equip our people to compete with our counterparts in Europe.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply because obviously he is much more aware of the problem than I am.  I can speak only as a family man who has children going to school and who gets reports back that there are problems and that there is need for the injection of additional funds into the voluntary secondary educational system.  However, we should not fall into the trap of sectionalising education, talking about third level, secondary, comprehensive and primary education.  Education enables us to feed our minds so that we can be better people and better citizens.  The Minister should look at education from the primary school upwards so that there is no discrimination in any part of the system.  I know the Minister <Col N="1619" /> is concerned about this, but it is important that he ensures that no section would be left underprivileged. Those involved in third level education, for instance, have a very vocal lobby but we must not fall into any trap.  I am glad that parents are becoming more interested in the question of the education of their children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned I had expressed the hope that during the adjournment the Minister might consider further the case we were putting forward and might find himself in a position to come back and tell us that either on section 11 or on the appropriate section of the Wealth Tax Bill he would be prepared to incorporate the provision of which the effect would be that a taxpayer liable for both income tax and wealth tax would not under any circumstances be liable for total tax in excess of his total income.  I wonder whether the Minister has thought about this and, if so, if he would give us the benefit of his thoughts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The benefit of the Government's thoughts are contained in that section of the Wealth Tax Bill which provides that wealth tax and income tax combined shall not exceed 80 per cent of income provided always that a consequential reduction shall not exceed more than 50 per cent of the wealth tax that would otherwise be payable.  There are no adequate reasons for departing from that provision. The kind of situation we are being asked to relieve would make for very bad law because a person could have an asset worth £2 million but could contrive to have a very small income and, as a consequence, not have to pay a fair share of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1620" /> For instance, there are sites in a number of urban areas which are worth more than £2 million.  It is desirable in the public interest that the owners of such sites would be encouraged to redevelop them rather than that society should be forced to borrow money in these very expensive days in order to develop virgin sites on the fringe of the city while assets to which the community has some right are frozen.  All countries operating a wealth tax have accepted the value of the system whereby people are encouraged to put their assets to productive use.  To have no limitation on the reduction which an owner of wealth could obtain in his income tax and wealth tax combined would mean the continuance of a system whereby assets would not be put to their best use.</P>
    <P>One could visualise a situation also in which a person might sit on a source of mineral wealth.  We would hope to have established in the not too distant future the existence of oil resources within our jurisdiction.  It would be intolerable to have a situation in which people could withhold from the community the development of such a resource and at the same time not pay adequate tax.  The qualification we have is such as will ensure that no avoidable hardship is caused and also that wealth is put to sensible use.</P>
    <P>As I have emphasised, sensible people resort in sensible ways to tax codes.  If tax codes are stupid and allow either the foolish use or the non-use of wealth, that situation will continue.  But if the tax code has the consequence of encouraging people to put wealth to use, it is a good code even if it never yielded a penny in tax because it would encourage people to take steps to avoid tax by putting their wealth to more productive use. This would be good for them as well as for the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with income tax, not wealth tax.  We are providing significant reliefs.  During the break I learned the news that our neighbours across the water are increasing the rate of income tax by 2p in the £ on all rates except the highest whereas <Col N="1621" /> we are reducing income tax.  This is an indication that we are anxious to provide reliefs for taxpayers and this, in turn, will encourage initiative.  It will cool inflationary demands for increased salaries in the higher paid sector and it is coupled with a provision in another Bill which will ensure that no person is put in an avoidable hardship situation.  If hardship situations arise because of our not providing for a reduction without a limit, it is hardship which can very easily be avoided by any person who takes reasonable steps to use his wealth more productively.  That is something which our economy, like any other, could do with.  Economies that have wealth taxes have found it to be one of the beneficial end products that people put their resources to better use than merely leaving them to lie idle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, we are dealing here with income tax, but in dealing with the section originally he acknowledged that one cannot view it without viewing also the impact of wealth tax.  Apart from the wealth tax the reasons which the Minister advanced in favour of this section are ones which, as I indicated earlier, I would not quarrel with; but that does not mean we are to close our eyes to what is proposed in this section in conjunction with wealth tax.</P>
      <P>First, the Minister says that people who find themselves in the position of paying more than 100 per cent of their income as a result of the combination of wealth and income tax will very quickly change their arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He must be aware that there are circumstances under various kinds of trusts and so on where it is quite impossible to change the nature of investments so as to bring about the situation he visualises.  Secondly, the Minister picked an unfortunate example when he talked of people sitting on mineral wealth.  It is hardly beyond the ingenuity of the Revenue Commissioners, as they have demonstrated frequently in the past, to devise a method whereby people who are deliberately and unjustifiably holding back in order to keep down their income can be got at.  In the case of mineral <Col N="1622" /> wealth it is not only justifiable but very desirable in the national interest that exploitation should not proceed at a rate of the kind that would be done by somebody who was in for a quick profit and wanted to get out without developing the resources on a fully economic basis, simply trying to get the cream out of it.  It would be extremely undesirable that we should, by our tax system, produce a situation in which people would be positively encouraged to use up resources such as minerals as fast as possible without regard at all to the economics or to the national interest.</P>
    <P>The argument put forward by the Minister for the more effective use of assets has a number of flaws in it. The problems that arise can be easily dealt with but the Minister has not dealt with the basic principle involved: that to tax somebody at more than his annual income is confiscation. The Minister has spoken as though it would be wrong and unjust to the community, if not to the individual, to provide a kind of relief that says one does not pay more than one's income in tax.  Logically, if he is right in what he says, there should be no provision in the Wealth Tax Bill that a person who is in the kind of position we are talking about pays only 50 per cent of wealth tax.  If there is any basis for the argument the Minister is putting forward there should be no relief, it should be the same wealth tax for everybody.  To that extent, if the Minister's argument is correct, people would be more encouraged to use their assets efficiently.</P>
    <P>The Minister recognised the fallacy of this argument by providing that in the kind of circumstances we are talking about only 50 per cent would be paid.  Nevertheless, even with that provision a situation can arise where the combination of tax under this section and wealth tax will exceed the annual income.  That is the point on which I want to be clear.  The Minister said that the attitude of this Government was set out in the White Paper on Capital Taxation.  Does the Minister really mean that?  Does he mean that the Government support the proposition <Col N="1623" /> that in certain circumstances there should be more taxation than annual income?  If that is so are the Government not supporting confiscation of property?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, to say that it applies only to a small number of people does not justify it, but is it not true that if it can apply to a small number of people today it can apply to a large number of people tomorrow?  Is not this, apart from anything else, a very good reason why the principle involved should not be accepted?  I do not want to have this debate going round in circles.  The net point at issue is: is it right or wrong for this House to enact legislation which could result in annual taxation at a rate in excess of 100 per cent of income?  I contend that taxation of that kind is confiscation. If the Minister says it is not I should like him to explain why it is not.  To say that people can switch their investment so as to ensure that they have enough income to pay it is only part of the answer.  There are circumstances in which this cannot be done.  There may be good reasons why it cannot be done.  In those circumstances is there any other answer to this than confiscation?  Does it not mean that people have to dispose of assets each year in order to pay an annual tax?  People have no choice in this.  If that is not confiscation, would the Minister tell us what it is?  If it is confiscation, is the Minister saying that he and the Government support that principle?  We should be clear on where we stand on this matter.</P>

      <P>I do not think I can add anything to what I have already said except that the Government want a system which will encourage people to put their wealth to good use.  Any sane person will do that.  We had a system in which a great deal of wealth was not being put into productive use. A tax system which encourages people to put their wealth to productive use is a good system.  That involves no confiscation at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>Can the Minister guarantee that?</P>

    <Col N="1624" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If a person acts sensibly there are plenty of opportunities for making profit.  If any person wants to get out of an asset which is not productive he can do so and put his money where it will yield a handsome return.  That is all that is necessary.  However, if a person decides not to do that because he is making a bigger capital gain on holding wealth than any element of tax which he may have to pay, it is his choice.  I should like to emphasise that we are dealing with an income tax here.  The wealth tax proposals will involve a refund of wealth tax in certain situations, if the wealth and income tax combined exceed more than 80 per cent of the person's income.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley said that I had never argued for a reduction of the tax rates on any grounds other than wealth tax, but that is not so.  I argued it on several occasions and I should like to refer to a report in <i>Business and Finance</i> of 11th July, 1974, which records that I spoke about the matter to the third Irish National Management dinner on Monday 6th July.  On that occasion I said that it was ludicrous that in a country as relatively poor as Ireland that companies had to pay their top executives nominally more than their counterparts in the United Kingdom so that the take home salary was equal in both cases. I said that this situation had existed in this country for far too long and that the Government were very conscious of the need to re-examine the marginal rates of income tax.</P>
      <P>I went on to say that currently the top rate in Ireland was 80 per cent compared with 75 per cent in Britain and that the marginal rate in Britain applied only on incomes of over £20,000 whereas the 80 per cent rate here comes into play at less than half that amount.  I said that an executive here earning £10,000 a year would have a take home pay of £5,600, while a British manager on the same salary would have £6,586 in his pocket.  However, the Irish executive would need a nominal salary of almost £15,000 per annum to match the net income of his more fortunate UK colleague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> That is as good a reason for bringing in this amendment as any consideration affecting wealth tax.  The one that affects the top executive would affect thousands of people here. The kind of case Fianna Fáil are arguing for would affect no more than a handful of people with wealth running into millions of pounds and who, because they have this substantial wealth, will be conveniently positioned to make adjustments in their wealth holdings so as to generate for themselves an income which will make it possible for them to pay income tax and wealth tax and still leave a net income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister examines the record he will find that I said I was not aware of the Minister making the case he made today for the proposals in this section which were foreshadowed in the White Paper and then dealt with in this Bill.  I think he probably made reference to it in the debate on the Wealth Tax Bill.  But I was not aware of his making a case for these proposals, other than the wealth tax correlation. I certainly did not intend to convey that at no stage had the Minister made that case, because I was not aware with any certainty whether or not he had; I was speaking in relation to these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to repeat that I do not quarrel with the case of the Minister at all, apart from the wealth tax position.  Surely the Minister, if for no other reason than his experience as a lawyer, would not accept the argument that a proposal is good if it affects a small number of people only. There are certain basic rights which apply to every citizen, whether he is rich, poor or in between.  One of them is the right not to have his property confiscated.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say: &ldquo;A person can get out of this and so arrange things that his property will not be confiscated.&rdquo;  Some people can do that but not everybody.  Some people for good reason will not be able to do so.  In such cases does not taxation in excess of 100 per cent of income amount to confiscation?  If that is so, how does the Minister justify it? <Col N="1626" /> Does he not realise that such a provision is more than likely to be challenged on constitutional grounds, and very likely to be challenged successfully? Is there any point in this House enacting legislation which is more than likely to turn out to be unconstitutional? I have no doubt at all that in circumstances where a person has no alternative but to pay tax in excess of his income on an annual basis that would amount to confiscation and would be in breach of the rights conferred on our citizens by the Constitution.  I can see that there are circumstances in which when this arose something could be done about it.  But surely the Minister would concede that there are circumstances also in which nothing could be done about it.  That is the kind of situation to which I am asking him to direct his mind&mdash;in such circumstances can there be anything but confiscation? Surely the Minister does not support the principle of confiscation?  Could we get that from the Minister anyway?</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the question of the charging of wealth tax to an extent equal to or greater than income is a matter for the Wealth Tax Bill.  I have allowed a lot of latitude on this matter.  The Chair would like to get back to the Bill with which we are dealing at present and try to get finality on it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the fact that a good deal of latitude has been allowed.  But I would like to submit, Sir, that it is as reasonable to look for a reduction in income tax, when combined with wealth tax, as it is to look for a reduction in wealth tax when combined with income tax: either way, it does not matter on which there is a reduction in order to achieve the situation of not paying more than 100 per cent.  As you know, the Wealth Tax Bill does provide for a reduction, in certain circumstances, of 50 per cent.  In my submission, Sir, it does not really matter, within the rules of order, whether the reduction should be in income tax or wealth tax. That is the basis on which I have been arguing this case on this section.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree also that, as far as the Chair is concerned&mdash; in regard to the rules of debate when a Bill is before the House on a specific matter&mdash;the Chair must try to keep the debate to the Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the difficulty of the Chair, but I am sure the Chair will appreciate also the difficulty of Deputies dealing with this Bill, knowing that we have a Wealth Tax Bill before us which will operate in conjunction with this one.  Does the Minister accept the proposition that there should not be confiscation of property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. That is why I abolished death duties, which was confiscation and which operated up to 65 per cent of a person's estate.  If the Chair would bear with me while I answer this specific irregular question, death duties can confiscate 65 per cent of an estate of, say, £2 million in estate duty, legacy and succession duty.  I make the proposition that that would confiscate more of that wealth owner's property than a lifetime's application of income tax and wealth tax as proposed by us under this and the Wealth Tax Bills.  That is a mathematical calculation which can be made by anybody.  One will find that the combined effects of the new proposal would be less confiscatory than the situation Deputy Colley is describing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would submit that the Minister is missing the point here. To be obliged to pay a lump sum which is a percentage of one's capital less than 100 per cent cannot be deemed to be confisatory.  But to be obliged to pay tax on an annual basis which is greater than one's annual income is surely in a different category from the situation described by the Minister.  However, he has said that he accepts the proposition that there should not be confiscation.  If he accepts it, how does he see the kind of situation I have been describing working out in circumstances in which it is not possible for the taxpayer so <Col N="1628" /> to arrange his affairs as to enable an income to be available out of which to pay both taxes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If one looks at wealth tax&mdash;if such a situation were ever to arise&mdash;retrospective relief could always be provided.  As I have said, one would think we lived in a static world in which people of massive wealth could not arrange their affairs so as to produce adequate income with which to pay their taxes.  If such a creature exists, it would probably be helpful to that person to be encouraged to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. But I am quite certain that in our open market economy such a person would have that facility.  There will be provision which will, if necessary, enable trusts to be adjusted in such a way as would enable suitable arrangements to be made.  We have had an interesting debate on this topic.  How much it relates to real life is another thing.  We are dealing with income tax in this Bill.  We are providing reliefs.  The Deputy says that he accepts that these reliefs are desirable in themselves.  I would suggest that we leave it at that and debate the other issue on another day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong this discussion because, obviously, we are not going to get any further. The furthest we have got is the statement by the Minister, on the record, that he accepts there should be no confiscation.  I am hoping&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But he knows, as I do, that confiscation in this context means something quite different.  I am rather concerned at the fact that he thinks that confiscation cannot arise, that everybody who will be affected will be free to search around and avoid confiscation. I want to tell the Minister <Col N="1629" /> now that he is going to find that there are some people who will not be in that position.  I do not see why the Minister would not be prepared to accept the proposition and build in either into this section of this Bill or the Wealth Tax Bill that not more than 100 per cent of income would be taken into taxation&mdash;under income tax and wealth tax combined&mdash; with safeguards to deal with a person who is deliberately keeping down his income.</P>
      <P>Since apparently he is not prepared to accept that&mdash;I do not want to prolong the debate&mdash;I want to tell the Minister that we will be dealing with this again on the Wealth Tax Bill.  I hope that between now and then he will look further into the matter and, having looked into it, that he will find it possible to build into the Wealth Tax Bill the kind of proposition I have been putting forward and which I sought to have built into this section. If he does not, I can assure him that sooner or later the operation of this section, combined with the section in the Wealth Tax Bill, will be found to be of very doubtful constitutional validity.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to increase the personal allowances under the income tax code from those obtaining last year by 25 per cent.  The Bill contains proposals to increase these allowances by 15 per cent.  There were some references to this matter in the House on earlier dates in the course of which the Minister referred to increases in the cost of living over what appeared to be a nine-months' period.  I hope we will have no further confusion on this matter and that it will be accepted as a fact, which it is&mdash;so that we need not waste time on this and can get down to the reality&mdash;that there never has been under our system so far, at least not in my recollection, a nine-months' income tax year.  Some confusion has arisen because we had a nine-months' financial year but the income tax year did not change.  It was, and still remains, from April to April.  It is a 12-month income tax year so what we are talking about in this section, and in the proposals in this amendment to alter the figures in the section, are income tax allowances for a 12-month period, and the 12-month period involved is from April, 1975, to April, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> As I said, the proposals in the Bill are to increase the allowances by 15 per cent.  We know from the official statistics from the Central Statistics Office&mdash;the latest available for one year are from February, 1974, to February, 1975&mdash;that the cost of living over that 12-months' period increased by 23.8 per cent, almost 24 per cent. We also know that the latest figure available for the cost-of-living increase for a quarter is for the quarter ending in mid-February of this year and, for that period, the increase was 8 per cent, an annual rate, if it were to continue, of 32 per cent.  There is no indication that inflation is likely to reduce certainly in the short term future. On the contrary, the indications from the last quarterly rate of increase and from all other indicators we have are that inflation will continue to increase. Therefore I decided to propose in this amendment increases of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I must say with all candour that I think an increase of 25 per cent in the income tax allowances for the year April, 1975, to April, 1976, will almost certainly be less than the increase in the cost of living in that period but, since, naturally enough, I have not got any accurate figures for a period which has not yet occurred, I can only go on the basis of the figures we have.  Since the latest figures for a year were almost 24 per cent and the latest figures for a quarter projected over a year would be 32 per cent, and since the indicators are that there will certainly be increases in the cost of living at a higher rate than we have experienced over the past year, it seems to me that a proposal to increase these figures by 25 per cent is the very minimum and the most modest increase one can propose if one is endeavouring to keep these allowances in line with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, possible to talk about periods in the past when income tax allowances were not increased, but it must be recognised that not to increase income tax allowances with inflation running at 6 per cent or 7 per cent is of a different quality from not <Col N="1632" /> to increase income tax allowances when inflation is running in the region of 25 per cent to 30 per cent.  There is an enormous difference between the two situations and it only confuses the issue to try to compare them.  In the last Fianna Fáil budget in 1972 income tax allowances were increased. In the following year in the first Coalition budget income tax allowances were not increased.</P>
    <P>Last year they were increased but the increases were such that the position with regard to the take-home pay of the great majority of the taxpayers was worse after the allowances were given than it had been under the Fianna Fáil budget in 1972.  The position had deteriorated somewhat from 1972 and now added to that deterioration is the further erosion involved if we do not accept this amendment, an erosion which is involved where the income tax allowances for the coming year are proposed to be increased by 15 per cent, when the inflation for that period will certainly be a minimum of 25 per cent.  There is no way in which one can deny that this involves an erosion of the position of taxpayers.  Consequently, merely to try to hold the position where it is, it is necessary to increase these allowances by 25 per cent as a minimum. This does not improve the position of the taxpayers.  It merely holds it and, as I indicated earlier, almost certainly will not hold it at its present position.  There will be a drop back.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this. Ministers for Finance successively have from time to time given reliefs under the income tax code and they have tended to talk fairly loudly&mdash;I did it myself&mdash;of the number of taxpayers released from the tax net.  Last year the present Minister for Finance talked very loudly about this although he knew, as we did, that there was a new national pay agreement about to be implemented and that agreement would certainly bring those he was releasing, and maybe more, back into the tax net.  One of the consequences of allowing the income tax allowances to drop substantially behind the inflation rate is that many people are brought into the tax net who would otherwise be outside it.  We are talking <Col N="1633" /> now about people at the bottom of the income scale and I freely admit that the figures over the years show that what I have said has happened.</P>
    <P>There are of course other factors involved, but one of the factors involved in increasing very substantially the number of taxpayers was the erosion in the value of the income tax allowances.  That was serious enough in the past but it is mightily important with inflation running at the rate it is now; and, if we are not very substantially to reduce the take home pay of taxpayers, particularly at the lower end of the scale, the very least that can be done is to accept this amendment.  It may be said that that is all very well but it will cost a great deal of money and where would the money come from.</P>
    <P>That is a valid point and I want to put forward the proposition that, if all the sums are done, this sort of exercise does not cost the Exchequer as much as might appear, because in the great majority of cases the increase in take home pay involved in increasing income tax allowances is spent almost immediately.  Much of it is taken in in another form of tax, such as value-added tax, and the money is used directly in the stimulation of the economy, an objective the Minister claimed he was trying to achieve by other methods.  The net effect of the net cost to the Exchequer is not just the amount of the drop in income tax receipts.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, since there is now another national pay agreement very likely to be implemented, although I know there are still hurdles to be overcome but, even if there is not a national pay agreement, there will certainly be some pay increases and the position will be rather similar to that of last year: pay increases will be implemented which will put people who are not in the tax net now into the tax net and, on the basis of the allowances proposed, the Minister's provisions will eat much deeper into the pay packet.  Calculations as what the cost to the Exchequer would be must take account of that factor.  I am urging that acceptance of the amendment involves nothing more <Col N="1634" /> than equity to taxpayers and is also capable of economic benefits to the community and of monetary benefit to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I have said on previous occasions&mdash;I repeat it now&mdash; that it is difficult to accept a lecture from Fianna Fáil about giving income tax reliefs when, during their period in office, the number of income taxpayers increased from 195,000 to 700,000 and the number of sur-taxpayers was reduced from 10,000 to 6,650.  That is a record of neglect of adjustment of income allowances which I would have thought common decency would have compelled them to remain silent about for evermore and a day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The way in which the Exchequer would have to make up that loss would be by increasing all rates of tax by 4½p so that the 26p rate would become 30½p, the 35p rate would become 39½p and so on.  It seems to me a futile exercise to engage in the kind of mathematical cosmetic arrangement that the Opposition are now suggesting, an arrangement which would force the Dáil to amend the rates of tax to make up for the loss consequential on the adoption of this amendment.  In order that people may properly assess what has happend it is worthwhile pointing out that, when we came into office, every income tax payer paid more than his counterpart in Britain.  Now that situation has changed so that a man with an income of £7,000 will pay less tax than he did previously.  In addition to that, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer today imposed an extra 2p on income tax.  We could have done the same thing and given bigger marginal reliefs but the net result would have been precisely the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were debating the budget Deputy de Valera acknowledged that <Col N="1635" /> it was a popular and easy thing to demand tax reductions and bigger personal allowances.  He also acknowledged that it would be necessary to obtain the money from some other source.  It is, of course, very easy to make this argument.  It is popular to suggest that additional income tax relief ought to be given, but the crunch comes just as much for the Opposition as for the Government.  Where is the alternative revenue to be found?  As Deputy de Valera asked: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo;  He posed a question that people do not want to answer.  It is a question from which people run away.  But one cannot run away from it if the proposition is that revenue be cut by £16 million.  You must either say where the alternative £16 million will be found or withdraw your amendment.  In all decency that is what Fianna Fáil should do.  We have given considerable reliefs in personal allowances.  These will cost the Exchequer £28 million.  On the companies' front we are giving £12 million relief.</P>

      <P>If we did not provide that £12 million relief employment would have been put in jeopardy.  The Opposition are not prepared to accept that the alternative is an increase of 4½p in all rates of tax.  They would also argue that the £12 million relief given to industry is wrong and that £9 million of that £12 million should have been taken to provide the increased personal allowances which they now, in their irresponsible opposition, are suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the majority of taxpayers would prefer to have their allowances set as they were in the budget rather than in accordance with the additional measure of relief now suggested.  The fact that there was not public protest about the reliefs in the budget is an indication that the ordinary taxpayer appreciated the reliefs we gave in personal income tax, which amounted to £60 million.  This contrasts more than favourably with <Col N="1636" /> what our opponents gave in Government&mdash;one adjustment in 16 years and nothing at all for 11 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To the surprise of the people, for two years running this Government gave adjustments the real effect of which, unlike what happened under Fianna Fáil when the adjustment once given was soon eroded and people who were released from the tax net were brought back again, was that the reliefs we gave in the last two years did not have the effect of bringing back everybody who was relieved. Between 1957, when the single allowance was £150 and the married allowance £310, and 1968 there was not any effective increase in those allowances, notwithstanding that the cost of living went up by 46 per cent. I am sorry, the Deputy is right: there were two allowances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost was £4 million, and in 1972, when the allowances were increased by £50 for a single person and £70 for a married person the adjustment cost £13 million, a total of £17 million.  It is in that context that they are suggesting we have not done enough by giving £60 million in 1974-75.  We are only too glad to allow people to offer criticism&mdash;we will take it whether it be just or unjust&mdash;but it is difficult to accept criticism by people who followed such a miserable pattern during their terms in office.  The cost of living has not risen because of changes in taxation on beer and cigarettes for any person who does not drink or smoke.  The national wage agreement is providing compensation for a non-existing rise in the cost of living for people who do not smoke or drink. That is a reality.  I am not adopting or posing any moral attitude towards the situation.  I am simply offering the thought and asking people whether it is justifiable to continue to compensate oneself for changes which the Government regard as necessary in the tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> The alernative to providing increases in necessary taxation through the indirect taxation system is to impose direct tax increases on income. That would be contrary to the Government's objective which is to adjust the direct taxes, taking one year with another, so that the value of the take-home pay will not be eroded.  But if we continue to compensate ourselves, either through the direct taxation system or through pay demands, for transfers in income on non-essential items, all we do is to fuel the fires of inflation; and when we are already at a rate of inflation which is double that of our competitors, it is surely time to take stock of the folly of our own actions and try to arrest the situation.</P>
    <P>We have provided in this year's budget substantial amelioration of the income tax position as it affects all taxpayers.  We have done that without increasing the rate of direct taxation. Admittedly we have increased the rate of indirect taxes on non-essentials.  If the Opposition through some ingenious suggestion can find the revenue which would be lost by their proposal, without hardship, without adding to the consumer price index, without adding to the burden of inflation, I would be prepared to consider it.  But they cannot do it because they know there is no such alternative open to them.  In that situation&mdash;they have made their points&mdash;they should withdraw their amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I support Deputy Colley's amendment.  I have listened to the Minister telling us about the tax reliefs given in the last budget.  He said it could cost £16 million to accept Deputy Colley's amendment.  If the Minister looks deeper into the situation he will find that most of this £16 million would automatically flow back into the economy.  Half of it would be recouped through indirect taxation.  We know that indirect taxation on cigarettes and liquor today accounts for 60 per cent of all taxation and a substantial part of the £16 million would be recouped in the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister compared figures today <Col N="1638" /> with 1967 and 1968 when inflation was barely reaching 6 per cent or 7 per cent.  There is no comparison between the allowances given at that time and the position today.  I remember when we were discussing the Financial Resolution in the last budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated on that occasion that approximately 60,000 people would be exempt from tax liability.  I would remind the Minister that workers had to seek increases of 25 per cent and 30 per cent in the last 12 months to try to compensate for the increased cost of living and inflation and I am quite convinced that 50,000 were back in the tax net when the increases were granted under the national wage agreement.  It is obvious that the same situation will arise in this case.  The new national wage agreement makes provision for an increase of 25 per cent.  Surely the Minister will agree that an allowance of 15 per cent now is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>We are facing a most unpredictable year when people do not know by how much prices will increase and what their wages will be.  There are predictions of an inflation rate of 25 per cent to 30 per cent.  Surely the Minister will agree that a 15 per cent adjustment in the income tax code will be an infinitesimal concession by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>For a man earning £2,500 per year, his saving will be £19.50 for the coming year while a man earning £9,000 will have a saving of £48.75.  That cannot be considered a proper adjustment of income tax.  The Minister cannot seriously think that £75 per year will compensate for price increases in the coming year.  I am particularly concerned about people living outside the city who have to travel 30 miles or more each morning; there are many people living in Navan, Drogheda or Naas who have to travel to Dublin each morning to their place of work Does the Minister think an income tax concession of £19.50 will compensate them for the astronomical increase in fuel and motoring costs?</P>
    <P>With regard to people in the lower income bracket, we could be reaching a dangerous situation with regard to the employed and the unemployed. <Col N="1639" /> If a single man earning £1,250 a year is charged a high rate of income tax while a man on a three-day week is drawing unemployment benefit without paying tax, there will be a very delicate balance regarding the profitability and desirability of working.  If we reach a situation where it is just as profitable to work a three-day week and draw social welfare benefits for three days as it is to work a full week, we will be moving into an economic situation out of which we will find it very difficult to get.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider our amendment.  It will cost the Exchequer only £16 million but I have already pointed out that much of this amount will be recouped through indirect taxation on beer, spirits, cigarettes and other commodities that carry a high revenue tax. The Minister said there was little protest with regard to the income tax allowance and he pointed out it was accepted by the people.  I should like to tell the Minister that the people are so confused about taxes, rising prices and the stability of their employment that they have not considered an issue such as this.  The Minister must agree that the infinitesimal concession given was more than off-set by the increase in the cost of the social welfare stamp.  He gave approximately a £75 per year increase in the income tax allowance for the single person but the deduction for the social welfare stamp will cost the employee approximately 42p per week.</P>
    <P>The wage earner has not been given any encouragement.  If the rate of inflation was 6 per cent or 7 per cent and if the cost-of-living increase was a reasonable one, the adjustment made by the Minister would be appreciated and I would have said we were moving in the right direction but in present circumstances the figure allowed by the Minister is quite unrealistic.  The Minister did not make any provision for people who must travel long distances to their places of employment.  When Deputy Colley was Minister for Finance, I remember <Col N="1640" /> the present Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, seeking some concessions for these people.  Now the Minister has an opportunity to help them.  If the person in the lower income group is not encouraged to work, if he sees it is just as beneficial to remain unemployed, there is little hope for the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider Deputy Colley's amendment which seeks to increase the rate from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.  We know that last year wages increased by 25 per cent to 30 per cent and, since it is obvious that there will be provision for an increase of at least 25 per cent in the new agreement, there will be considerable buoyancy in revenue.  Neither the Minister nor anyone else knows what increases there will be in prices for the coming year or what will be the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increased taxes which the Minister put on we must have regard to the indirect taxation which the Minister will agree affects the working man.  The tax the Minister imposed on beer, spirits and cigarettes is a tax on what the working man expects out of life.  For any man in the building trade or similar heavy work these things are not taken as a luxury any more.  The Minister may say such items should not contribute to the price index.  It is a matter for the Minister to remove them from the index if he wishes, but they do contribute to it.  The average worker expects this little luxury at the end of the day.  The fairly substantial increases on beer, spirits and cigarettes have eroded incomes and they certainly affect the tax free allowance the Minister is granting here.</P>
    <P>When you take all these items into consideration&mdash;the petrol, the increased social welfare stamp and the indirect taxation&mdash;the Minister has given practically nothing to the average worker in regard to income tax. In the current budget of about £1,200 million I believe the £16 million which Deputy Colley is asking for here would be negligible and the Minister would recoup 50 per cent of it, at least, through indirect taxation. This would have a beneficial effect, <Col N="1641" /> especially in the lower income group, and they would feel that it was worthwhile going to work.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We find that despite the increased allowances last year and those proposed this year, which the Minister told us were so generous compared with those given in the past, and despite the enormous increase in unemployment&mdash;which, of course, reduces the number of taxpayers substantially&mdash;nevertheless the number of people liable to income tax has increased to 720,000 from 700,000 in round figures, as the Minister said. That is a fairly revealing comment on the value of the income tax allowance of which the Minister spoke so glowingly a short time ago.  It would also appear that the figure of £16 million which the Minister gave as the cost of acceptance of this amendment was, as I suspected, calculated without reference to the economic effect and consequent effect on the revenue of granting this increased allowance proposed. Consequently, the figure really means nothing.  It is quite unrealistic to talk about it and ask where will you get it and to produce estimates of what it will mean in other taxes to produce the same sum.  The figure is purely fictitious and has no relation to the reality of the situation.</P>
      <P>I have no facilities to calculate the likely real effect of this increase on the revenue but I am certain it would be vastly less than £16 million.  In talking of what has been done and what may have to be undone to implement this, the Minister spoke about £12 million given to industry in the budget.  He ignored&mdash;wisely&mdash;an interjection from Deputy Fitzpatrick, but I would like to remind him of it. Shortly after the announcement in the budget of this relief for industry costing the Exchequer £12 million the Government introduced substantially increased social welfare contributions, the cost of which to industry and business generally is.  I think, approximately twice the £12 million that the Minister spoke of as relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If industry needed this £12 million as the Minister said&mdash;indeed it did, and more&mdash;what is the point of making that argument and asking us if we want to take it away again when the Government themselves have already <Col N="1643" /> taken it away?  Much more than that allowance has been taken away and this has made the position of industry generally even worse than it was before it was proposed to give this £12 million.  It is quite unrealistic for the Minister to ask if we want to take it away when he has already taken it away himself.</P>
    <P>Further, we heard the Minister, as I feared we would&mdash;I tried to anticipate it and urged that we have a more realistic debate than we had in the past but the Minister could not resist the temptation&mdash;going back over the years and he took the figures of the cost to the Exchequer years ago of increasing income tax allowances at that time.</P>
    <P>This is an example of the tactics used regularly not only by this Minister but by other Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.  When it suits them they will talk about the percentage increase in inflation and so on.  Also when it suits them, instead of talking about that, they will talk in terms of absolute figures.  The Minister talks of the cost of the income tax allowances last year and those proposed this year as £60 million and compares that with the cost of income tax allowances given some years ago.  He knows as well as I do that that comparison is totally invalid because he is not comparing like with like.  If he wants to compare like with like, he would have to adjust either the £60 million downwards or the earlier figure upwards, at least in relation to the movement in the cost of living or the inflation figure.</P>
    <P>Another way of approaching it would be to ask what proportion of the budget was involved in the comparable figures.  Then he would get a reasonable comparison.  To quote the absolute figure this year, with money having fallen so much in value, and comparing that with the 1969 figure is nonsense.  It is time we got away from this type of nonsense which, in my view, is pathetic and does not contribute to a reasonable and rational discussion of the questions with which we are concerned.  I repeat, I am not levelling this accusation solely at this <Col N="1644" /> Minister, although he was guilty of it here tonight and in the past.  Most of his colleagues are guilty of using this same ridiculous tactic.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to increases in the consumer price index brought about by the increased taxation imposed on such things as beer, tobacco and spirits.  He correctly referred to the fact that the national pay agreement would compensate fully for these increased taxes, although some people benefiting from the national pay agreement did not either drink or smoke.  That is a fact of life and he must take it into account.  Before he imposed those taxes, did the Minister consider that this would happen?  Did he also consider that the cost imposed on industry and business generally far exceeded the revenue obtained by the Exchequer as a result of these increases?  If he would give some consideration to that aspect and apply it to this amendment, he would get a far more realistic assessment of the real cost to the Exchequer taking the economic factors into account.</P>
    <P>We had an example of this failure by the Minister to approach the matter in this way some time ago in relation to the introduction of the green pound and the cost of that to the home market.  If the Minister had dealt with that problem&mdash;there were only a few items of consumption involved and a small proportion on the home market&mdash;he could have counteracted its effects on the consumer price index.  He did not and the consequence was that the cost was multiplied enormously and, carried into the whole economy, increased our cost of living and the cost of government.  The same kind of approach is involved here in failing to allow for the real cost of the amendment proposed and, secondly, in the increases in indirect taxation to which the Minister referred and how they work themselves through the economy.  The overall result is to distort the apparent cost involved and to carry a burden on to the whole economy, to industry, to business generally, to employees and to everybody else.  If a little ingenuity were used by the Minister, <Col N="1645" /> he would have found that the revenue required could have been raised without imposing this multiplied effect on the economy.</P>
    <P>I am afraid he is approaching these personal income tax allowances on the same basis.  When he quotes the fictitious £60 million&mdash;I say &ldquo;fictitious&rdquo; in no way disputing how the calculation was done or imputing bad faith on the part of the Minister, but fictitious in the sense that it was calculated on the basis that it had no relevance to reality&mdash;he is adopting the same kind of approach.  The result is that he is getting unreal results from his calculations, which means that he cannot view the proposal in this amendment in the light of what it would really mean to the Exchequer and to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In the course of what the Minister said about compensation being awarded in the national pay agreement for these increases in taxation on beer, spirits and tobacco, he implied that taxpayers who were benefiting under the national agreement by being compensated fully for these increases should be penalised in some way under the income tax code.  It was also implied that one of the justifications for not increasing the personal allowances fully in line with the cost of living was that people were being compensated fully for these increases which, he said, were accepted as being necessary.</P>
    <P>I want to remind him of the increases involved, about 3 per cent in the consumer price index as against a 10 per cent gap between what is in the Bill and this amendment and what is required to keep pace at a minimum with the cost of living. What is the position in regard to those who do not drink or smoke?  Does he feel that the same approach has been made in this regard to those who do not drink or smoke and those who do?  Or has what he said any relevance to this matter?  The most notable thing he said was that he did not attempt to dispute the figures which I put forward in relation to the cost of living increases which have been occurring and which are likely to occur.</P>
    <P>He did not attempt to justify increasing <Col N="1646" /> personal allowances by only 15 per cent when, at best, one can say that the cost of living increase in the coming year, April to April, will be at least 25 per cent.  He did not attempt to deal with that and it is the kernal of the amendment.  I understand why he did not try to deal with it, except indirectly.  The real case he made was the cost.  He asked how we proposed this should be met.  I have already dealt with the fictitious nature of the figure of £60 million.  May I remind him that we suggested, before he introduced his budget, a broad outline of the kind of budget he might have introduced.  That would have had a very different effect on the economy. It would have stimulated it and led to demands for a smaller increase in income tax allowances because there would have been a smaller increase in the cost of living.  Therefore, if he is talking about remedies and how this might be done we told him how, but in a overall framework of how the budget might be approached and not on a patchwork basis in the budget he introduced and of which we disapprove. It is difficult for us to suggest ways in which this might be done, first, because, as I say, it is a patchwork on what he introduced and, secondly, because the first figure involved of what is required is not known.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gallagher has been granted leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, that is, the present dispute in the fishing industry.  The motion that the Deputy moves, therefore, is: &ldquo;That the Dáil do now adjourn&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the adjournment of the Dáil in order to deal with this important matter.  I am grateful to you for giving this opportunity to me, to the people on this side of the <Col N="1647" /> House and, indeed, to the fishermen, who are so much involved in these tragic circumstances, to debate this matter.  It is deplorable that the fishermen find themselves in a position where they have to take this rather drastic action.  Indeed, knowing fishermen, I can honestly say they are no way violent.  This was brought on them by the indecision of the Government in relation to the whole fishing industry.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, as head of this very important Department, should use such strong language in relation to the action of the fishermen.  In the two years I have been in this House I think his statements of the past few days are the only ones I have heard him making in relation to the fishing industry.  It is rather sad to see that he used such strong language against the fishermen. I should like to quote from the newspapers what he said: &ldquo;They have gone crazy.  They do not know when to stop. I never saw this side of them before. They are not acting sensibly.&rdquo;  Statements of this kind show a lack of responsibility on the part of the Minister and would seem to be made with the intention of showing the fishermen as an irresponsible group who do not care how they behave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope, for the benefit of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the House, to clear the air on this matter and let the nation see who these crazy people are.  First of all, it is important to understand that for the first time in years fishermen, through their own organisation, the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, speak with one voice.  Any decisions arrived at have been taken in a rational, democratic fashion.  In the past you had fragmentation with a number of groups and organisations speaking on behalf of the fishermen but that is no longer true.  Through the Federation of Irish Fishing Co-operatives and the various organisations, which were working until now in the interests of fishermen, they now speak with one voice.  They are a responsible, active organisation working on behalf of fishermen.  Through the initiative of the IAOS a number <Col N="1648" /> of years ago a full time secretary had been employed, who acts on behalf of the fishermen's organisation and who devotes his time entirely to fishing interests.</P>
    <P>Some of these people, apart from the present agitation, have got together various times in the past few years to demand their rights and to protect their interests.  They produced plans and policies many of which might be accepted as part of a blueprint for the fishing industry.  These people could hardly be described as crazy when they went to Brussels to fight against the question of equal access.  There was nothing irresponsible about a recent seminar which they held, where they clearly stated their views and gave a very clear indication of what was necessary in this industry.  Their handling of this seminar was on a par with anything I saw produced here.  The standard of debate was high and the contributions by the fishermen were well researched.  They showed foresight and a keen interest in the development of this very important industry.</P>
    <P>At the seminar the chairman read a very fine paper giving a clear indication of what the Irish Fishermen's Organisation saw as necessary in the development of this vital industry.  He listed a number of points such as finance, the restructuring of the fishing fleet, education, marketing, shore facilities, conservation and fishing limits, the potential of the industry and marine rescue services.  It is against this background that the Irish Fishermen's Organisation met the Parliamentary Secretary and made certain demands in relation to the industry.  I think I have clearly indicated that this group acted in a responsible way and that we should have a withdrawal by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries of his description of the fishermen.  The demands they made to the Parliamentary Secretary are very reasonable and I cannot see how they can be turned down by any responsible Government. I find it very hard to understand why the fishermen have been cold shouldered in the way they have been in the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>They asked for an overall plan for <Col N="1649" /> fisheries, a ministry, the extension of our fishing limits.  They asked that the Government should back Britain on the renegotiation of sections 4 and 5 of our entry into the EEC and for restrictions on the importation of fish from countries outside the Common Market group.  I do not see anything wrong in their demands.  An overall plan for the fishing industry is necessary. We have not made the progress we should be making in the industry. While a good deal of money has been spent down the years and loan facilities have been made available to fishermen for the purchase of boats and gear and also for various facilities, the extension of ports and so on, a great deal more is necessary. It is necessary to provide better facilities, to increase the size of boats, to improve piers and harbours and also to provide suitable port facilities for fish processing and so on.  These are some of the things which fishermen have been demanding. They want to know exactly where the Government are going and what they propose to do about these matters.</P>
    <P>One grievance the fishermen have relates to the Law of the Sea Conference. They have demanded that we fight for a 50-mile fishing limit, and they have asked to be represented at the talks on this matter.  The fishermen did not expect that they themselves should be allowed to contribute to the debate but that at least there would be some consultation with their group and that they would get some recognition in relation to this very important matter.  Their counterparts in Britain and other countries, I understand, are given this facility and have attended the various conferences on the extension of the limits, and they are quite happy to be able to participate and to join with the various delegations dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>Our fishermen have been ignored completely, have been given no facility at all.  They do not know what is happening.  They have not the slightest notion of what proposals our Government are making.  This causes a great deal of unrest in the organisation.  One <Col N="1650" /> can understand this unrest, because our fish is being taken away by foreign trawlers day after day.  Day after day one can see these large boats fishing in huge numbers off our coast using sophisticated gear and carrying off our rich harvest.  Unless some action is taken very quickly, it will not be worthwhile spending any money on a fishing fleet here in the near future.  The fish will not be there.  The way it is being taken out at the moment is frightening, and it is not being caught for human consumption.  Some figures I saw recently indicated that 35 per cent of the fish landings in Norway were used for industrial purposes.  It is no wonder our fishermen show concern.  It is a well-known fact that fishermen in the north of Scotland and particularly in the Shetland Islands have been showing concern about this quite recently, because the Norwegians are moving in on their territory, and they are now moving down along our coast and taking off these large catches.</P>
    <P>Another factor in all this has been the indecision of the Government in relation to the industry.  In the Book of Estimates for 1975 a reduction of 5 per cent was shown in the Estimate for Fisheries.  When one takes inflation into account, this represents a reduction of 25 per cent.  Due to pressure from this side of the House the Minister for Finance, in introducing his budget, made some extra money available which helped to keep the people in the boat-building industry happy anyway.  At the time a very strong case was made in order to ensure that funds would be made available to keep the thousand or so people involved in the boat-building industry at work.  Unfortunately, the Government placed severe restrictions on the way the extra money could be expended: only a person who wants to buy a new boat can now avail of a loan from Bord Iascaigh Mhara. People who want to buy secondhand boats are finding it very hard to get a loan.  People who are purchasing boats or are about to purchase boats do not know where they stand.  We are led to believe that the loan interest of 4 per cent which has been in operation for so long and which has helped our fishermen so much down the years is <Col N="1651" /> now being dispensed with.  Fishermen do not know what they will be asked to pay in the future, whether it will be 5 per cent, 10 per cent or even the current bank rates of 14 or 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>Considering that the industry employs 5,500 full-time fishermen and about 4,000 part-time fishermen, and that there are about 2,000 engaged in processing and in the region of 1,000 working in boat-building, I think we deserve better treatment than this from the Government and from the Parliamentary Secretary.  There is a high investment in fishing.  The fishermen themselves have shown their confidence in the industry by investing in larger boats.  The fact that the larger boats can cost as much as £500,000 and that there are fishermen who are prepared to spend this figure, shows that they have the confidence, the ability and the skill to go into the industry and expand as they should be doing.</P>
    <P>Against that background, I believe the fishermen have been very harshly treated, that they deserve better.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the Government should review the whole position in the hope that the action which the fishermen have been forced to take will be brought to an end. The fishermen regret this action.  They are the losers whichever way one looks at the situation because they have to forego their fishing activities.  However, the effort is an organised one. The men on the east coast have the full support of those on the south and west coasts as has been shown during the past few days.  I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will ensure that the demands of the fishermen are met, that market structures are improved, that restrictions are put on the imports of fish from outside the country, that oil subsidies are paid to the fishermen and that, generally, a fair deal will be given to the fishermen in their demands.</P>

We notified you of that arrangement which was that two speakers from this party would open the debate followed by the Government party coming in for half an hour and two speakers from this party concluding, with 15 minutes each.

      <P>I am sorry that we should have wasted five minutes on having this matter cleared up.  May I tender my thanks to the Chair for his concern and interest?  This has ensured that the club&mdash;the two sides of the House&mdash;shall not monopolise the entire hour and a half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse practically every word that was said by the mover of the motion, Deputy Gallagher.  In regard to the demands of the fishermen there is nothing being sought to which they would not seem to be fully entitled.  These people have been very patient when <Col N="1655" /> one considers the bad treatment they have received whether this was by reason of circumstances or by lack of action on the part of the Government, especially in the recent past.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with the terms of the reply he gave today when asked about the present situation which has resulted in a blockade of some of our ports.  I am only sorry that all the ports have not been blockaded.  This action has resulted in the Government taking note for the first time of the situation that obtains in the fishing industry. In his reply today the Parliamentary Secretary said that what was going on and any difficulties and sacrifices which were being experienced by the fishermen were entirely of their own making.  I am paraphrasing in the briefest way possible what I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say.  With his knowledge of the fishermen and their problems he could not hold that attitude personally.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared to support in every way possible the demands that are being made.  Take, for instance, the question of imports.  Why should imports be allowed to upset the fishing industry, an industry into which has been put a considerable amount of public money and in which not only the fishermen but the general public and the taxpayer have much interest?  It is ridiculous to fall back on the excuse that these matters are decided outside. Other members of the EEC do what suits their people and not what suits the Community.  They fight their case afterwards but they take their action when it has to be taken.  In this case I suggest that our unions who handle imports of every kind note that our fishermen and our fishing industry is being hurt by imports of fish.  They should see to it, in the absence of any Government action, that these imports are not handled and, therefore, are not able to come here.  In this way the Government could absolve themselves, wash their hands of the situation, but still claim they are good boys in maintatining and keeping within the EEC rules.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1656" /> There is also the question of fuel and the cost to our fishing fleet.  I cannot see why part of the £30 million to £50 million which the Government are raking off, allegedly on the basis of helping to conserve and to reduce our consumption of oil, cannot be directed towards needy cases, such as subsidising fuel for our fishermen. They are engaged in an industry which is still in its infancy despite the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary and others tell us how lively it has been, how it has been progressing over the years as a result of percentage increases in money allocated. I do not dispute these increases but I am of the opinion&mdash;I expressed this view when in Government&mdash;that we are treating our fishery potential with scant regard and as if we did not believe that a potential exists.  We are not realistically approaching the overall plan the fishermen are asking for.  It is commonsense in an industry with the colossal potential fishing has here, particularly relating to the west and north-west coasts where employment is so badly needed, that we should have an overall plan.  Such a plan should have been prepared years ago and should concern development in future years.</P>
    <P>The attitude of those in the Fisheries Division of the Department &mdash;whether it is a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister who is involved does not matter a scrap&mdash;does not really arise.  It is the attitude of the Government, who after all discharge the money to that Department, that will determine the progress to be made.  In order to have proper progress it is necessary to have an overall workable plan.  If this is not prepared in the next seven years and if we do not make big strides in that direction then all the talk about what may be renegotiated for the post-1982 era will not matter because we will not be in the strong position we should be with an ocean-going fleet. We will not be in a position to say in any discussions or renegotiations that we may have with the EEC that we want extended limits, or that we are prepared to fish and protect those limits.  If we are not prepared and <Col N="1657" /> geared to do these things then hollow and empty will be our arguments with the EEC in trying to get anything better than what we have tentatively been given for the intervening years.</P>
    <P>The plan must take three things into account.  I am not sure which comes first but all three must basically come together.  We need to have adequate training so that we will have the fishermen available.  We must have adequate anchorage, safe harbours and onshore facilities to process to the greatest degree the catches of our fishermen.  Above all we must have a proper marketing arrangement to ensure, unlike the present one which may have been improved by co-operatives but is not adequate, that the fishermen do not finish up getting the least while the consumer pays the most.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary at Question Time today indicated that our fishermen were getting as much as others by way of assistance.  He quoted a figure of £7 million as against £4 million some years ago. Surely this is not the method of measuring what we are doing for the fishing industry.  This is the fallacy perpetrated down the years, that if we can quote a percentage increase high enough it should be sufficient to answer all the criticism.  However, this is hollow and empty without any planning for the future.  What about the harbours that have not been developed and for which there are plans?  What about the onshore facilities that are needed more every day but are not being provided?  What about the additional boat building capacity that is needed here instead of sending our money outside because we cannot produce the boats in sufficient quantities or on time?  These are basics that should be contained within and provided for in any plan the Fisheries Division and the Government might embark upon.  These things are essential if we are to have any sort of proper planning, development, a vast improvement in the intake of fish, in the employment in the fishing industry and the overall prosperity of the country which could come from the potential which lies <Col N="1658" /> off our coast, particularly off the west and north-west.</P>
    <P>We must also keep in mind that anything we do by way of seeking increased limits for our own use or shared use with other members of the EEC must be done in conjunction with the provision of adequate means of protection and not as at present. We all know that at present, and in the past, by the time our fishery patrol vessel arrived in areas where offending trawlers were fishing those offending trawlers were outside the limit looking on.  As soon as the patrol left they returned to the fishing grounds.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware of this.  I am not criticising him in this regard: I sympathise with him in that there is little he can do about it unless there is a change within the Government from the point of view of providing finance. The Government should prepare a development plan of a progressive nature that will be accelerated in the next five years so that we can make some sense in so far as our demands for renegotiation with the EEC are concerned.</P>
    <P>In regard to the trotting out of the percentage increase in money provided I should like to know how much of that money has found its way back to the crews.  It should be remembered that without these crews no boat could go to sea.  Do the crews benefit from any of the extra money provided by the Government?  How much of the £7 million went towards fleet expansion and how much of that expanded fleet was purchased abroad and at what cost?  How much of it was purchased at home?  Do we give way to the idea that so long as we can trot out a big increase in the total capital provided, no matter how it may be dragged out of the Minister for Finance in the budget, everything in the garden is rosy?  If any proof is needed the fishermen, by their own self-sacrifice and protests which have brought about a situation whereby they are losing heavily as a result of being tied up, have given that proof.  Their livelihood depends on them going to sea but they are not fishing at present.  They are not <Col N="1659" /> doing this frivolously, they are doing it as a last resort to bring their grievances to the notice of this House and the Government.</P>

      <P>I will do that in a short time.  The Parliamentary Secretary should take into account what the protest is all about.  He should consider what those who are participating in the protest are losing.  Why have those involved in the protest gone to the extreme they have if they have not good reason for doing so? They found they could not find their way through to any successful conclusion by way of discussion with him unless they put the screws on in this way.  This is what the Parliamentary Secretary must consider.  He should not disregard the sacrifices being made by these people.  They would not have been driven to it were it not for the extreme circumstance obtaining.  They felt his hand should and must be strengthened, as it is now.  He should welcome the fact&mdash;as indeed I would welcome it were I in his position now &mdash;that the fishermen are organised right round the coast.  They are prepared to stand together, to make their protest together and to make themselves heard together.  With that whip then, I say to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;he may trot out what figures he likes for last year, this year or next year but he can tell the Government of the confrontation he has had and back up what I know he believes himself&mdash;that we have not even begun to scratch the potential that is our fishing industry and we will get nowhere until the fishermen's demands for an overall plan has been conceded, thought out and put into operation.  In the interim, there must be no imports of fish to the detriment of our fishermen and fuel costs should be subsidised out of the rake-off the Government are taking from the rest of us.  We would not mind were it put to that use.  In the overall, the extension of our limit must be considered, must be pressed. We must, for the very sake of the <Col N="1660" /> livelihood and the future of our fishing fleet, have an extended fishery limit, but we must be shown to be capable of protecting it.  Again, the Government enters into it, the Minister for Defence or whoever is responsible. In respect of all of these things I say the Parliamentary Secretary now has something on which to work which he never had before.  The fishermen are organised.  I hope they remain that way and, if necessary, block more and more ports until the Government see reason.</P>

      <P>I have a certain respect for Deputy Blaney.  He could have made some improvements when he was in charge of fisheries.  That is a long time ago and perhaps some day he may come back here.  You never know.  My aim, and the aim of the National Coalition Government as evidenced by the vast improvements and increases in the amounts of money made available for this industry, is to help fishermen in every way and to develop the industry in every way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know this is a risk industry in which you can have a fat time or a lean time.  From my own information in West Cork, and as a person living in a seaside fishing town where people have to get up early and move out <Col N="1666" /> into the Atlantic to get their bread and butter from it, I am aware of the difficulties and I appreciate them. I mentioned these difficulties several times in the House during my membership over the past 24 years.  I did not start talking about fisheries when I was assigned to this post.  I always saw the need for involvement.  I preached from the Opposition benches that fishermen should be better organised, that they should be treated with more courtesy and more civility, and that more attention should be paid to them by the powers that be.</P>
    <P>Since the wheel has turned I have tried to put that type of policy into practice.  I think the fishermen and their representatives will appreciate that, during the two years in which I have been in office, I have met groups of fishermen not only here in Dublin but in their own coastal towns on many occasions.  Every fisherman, irrespective of whether he is a skipper or a crewman and, indeed, those outside the industry but anxious about it such as processors and others, always have the right to come to the Department and that right will be observed during my time in this office, be it long or short.</P>

They know they can come to see me any time they wish.  They know the claims they make are getting the attention they deserve.  I sympathise with them.  At the end of 1974 and in the early part of 1975 prices were lean.  I am very pleased that prices are now moving upwards.  That is what we like to see. Some of you people were very disappointed when cattle prices moved up.</P>

    <P>I do not want to take up too much time trotting out figures relating to <Col N="1667" /> the aids we are giving to this industry at present.  I mentioned them on a number of occasions during the past two weeks.  I said publicly and privately in discussions I had with Deputies and fishermen that our aids to the industry, despite the fact that we are a small country and despite the world-wide economic recession of the past few years, compare more than favourably with those in any other country in the world, excluding the EEC.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil negotiated the negotiations.  I am not finding fault with them but imports of fish other than canned fish do not pose a great problem.  The figure is between £46,000 to £48,000 annually. The total value of all fish imports for the period January to September &mdash;this will give the House an idea of the position, because when I stand up here I try to impart as much information as I can and as concisely as I can do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The total value of all fish imports for the period January to September, 1974, from all sources was £2.6 million; £1.65 million worth from the EEC and £.95 million from third countries.  Third country imports consisted mainly of canned fish.  As this was mentioned in the memorandum submitted by the organisation and as it was mentioned by Deputy Gallagher and Deputy Blaney, that is the position.  I used to voice objections to the importation of fish but the regulations now provide the we must now allow importation. Apart from canned fish the money involved is relatively small being only £46,000 to £48,000.  We have <Col N="1668" /> no money no more than Fianna Fáil had except what we get from the taxpayers' pockets. It does not fall down from heaven.  There has not been manna for the past four thousand years.  We have to take money from the taxpayers, and the National Coalition Government and the Minister for Finance are concerned to see that all the money we get is usefully and gainfully employed.  Each industry is being dealt with on its merits.  In so far as the Fishery Vote is concerned, I have no fault to find with the Minister for Finance.</P>

When loan charges were introduced the procedure was two to one, the applicants paid two-thirds of the interest charges and the Government paid one-third.

      <P>I am dealing with the benefits available for applicants for boats.  We are all the time trying to get as much money as we can from our EEC membership.  Our EEC representatives are always fighting to get the last penny, irrespective of the industries concerned.  There are the FEOGA grants for the expansion of our fleet which pay 45 per cent of the cost in the case of selected applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> Deputy Browne asked specifically about the fuel subsidy.  We all appreciate the problems thrown up by the oil crisis.  They have been bearing heavily on almost all industries.  As I mentioned last Thursday in the House, when this crisis arose the fishermen's representatives met me and I asked them to give me statistics of their costs and their profit and loss accounts.  The provision of such statistics is elementary as far as making a case for State help is concerned. No one can walk along to the Exchequer and say: &ldquo;Such a group are badly off, they need a handout&rdquo;.  All such requests must be backed up by factual information.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat again my statements to the House on two previous occasions that in the absence of such figures I have to rely on the appraisal given to me by the officers of my Department.  Deputy Brennan questioned me on that.  Deputy Brennan was a member of a Cabinet for a number of years and I am sure he is aware of the essential procedures that must be adopted in a case like this.  It is my job to help the development of this industry in any way I can possibly do.  That is the job of work assigned to me by the State and I intend to do it irrespective of what Deputy Blaney, Deputy Gallagher or anybody else has to say, I am fearlessly on the side of the fishermen to ensure that they will get fair play.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies, including my good, loyal friend, Deputy Haughey, who was in control of the purse for a number of years, are conversant with the procedure.  I am sure if somebody in Fianna Fáil had gone along to Deputy Haughey when he was Minister for Finance and asked for money without any back-up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I appreciate that the fishing industry is mainly on a share system basis and that it is necessary for all skippers to keep <Col N="1670" /> accounts because they must disburse their funds weekly or fortnightly. They must take into account operational costs and so on.  Therefore, I thought it would be an easy job to assess these things.  Certain fishermen applied for FEOGA grants.</P>

I should dearly love to have another hour because there is so much information available to me here that I could indicate that there is a complete answer to the assertions made during this debate so far.  Again I repeat that the Government did use Deputy Blaney's yardstick in demonstrating their confidence in the industry.  Using that yardstick the Government certainly measured up and we will continue to help the industry in every possible way.

      <P>The reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary now will create nothing but despair and hopelessness in the fishermen concerned. The Parliamentary Secretary has not answered any of the demands quite clearly made by them over recent months.  He has, in fact, insulted them by not referring specifically to the matters we came here to debate.  The action taken by the fishermen, regrettable though it is, was brought about by the frustration induced by the Parliamentary Secretary in a group of people placed in a position in which they must listen to the kind of drivel to which the Parliamentary Secretary treated this House tonight.</P>

      <P>One of the most frustrating experiences of the fishermen on deputations to the Parliamentary Secretary has been the fact that he goes on talking for the duration of the deputation and they emerge weary and tired, but glad to get out, having got nothing.  Talking now about being willing to hold meetings is offering no hope to these men.  Their demands have been known to the Parliamentary Secretary for over a year.  Despite their well-founded arguments no action has been taken to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>The most frustrating aspect of this whole dispute is the apparent inability on the Parliamentary Secretary's part to understand that a problem exists. Even today when the special notice question was raised he seemed to think the fishermen were doing very well and that no problem existed.  To quote his own words: &ldquo;The standard of living of the fishermen has increased&rdquo;.  That is what he stated here today.  He could not have been more blunt when he said: &ldquo;I cannot see what grievances they can have&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that these men are suffering grave substantial financial losses, losses which have compelled them, against their wishes, to take action involving them <Col N="1672" /> in a blockade of some major ports to try to bring home to the Parliamentary Secretary that a problem does, in fact, exist?  It is regrettable after the length of time the Parliamentary Secretary has been in office that this is the only way the fishermen feel they can bring to the Parliamentary Secretary's notice in a forceful and effective manner the fact that they are faced with serious problems.  It may be that the Parliamentary Secretary is too lazy &mdash;I regret having to say this&mdash;to study the case in detail or sufficiently broadly to apprehend the problems.  If that is the case, then the fishing industry should not be saddled much longer with a Parliamentary Secretary who fails to apprehend the basic needs and the problems presented so plainly to him.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year the Parliamentary Secretary tolerated a totally inadequate sum for his office as published in the Book of Estimates for 1975.  The amount was so inadequate the chairman of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara said the boatyards would have to close by April of this year.  We know that several small boatyards involved in the production of the 35-foot fishing boat were informed by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara that no grants were available and some had to go on a shorter working week because of that.</P>
      <P>We know now that it was the vigilance of the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition here that forced the Government to restore the necessary finances, which they reluctantly did in the budget following the publication of the Book of Estimates.  Today we have had yet another example of the neglect of the fishing industry, with the men employed in the industry saying one thing and the Parliamentary Secretary saying something else.  The Parliamentary Secretary was proved wrong on the Book of Estimates issue.  He is wrong again on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very livelihood of every fisherman engaged in the industry is at stake. The problem is much more serious than was the problem the Parliamentary Secretary dealt with so glibly <Col N="1673" /> some months ago.  The fishermen have put their demands on the line.  Some of these can be met in the short term and others in the long term.  The requests are reasonable.  If they meet with a reasonable response the strike and the blockade will cease.</P>
    <P>The short-term case can be stated very briefly.  Over the past year the price of fish has fallen while operating costs have increased.  The majority of trawler owners have heavy repayments to meet in a loss making situation.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have the figures on all boats on repayments.  The monthly income from catches is available. The outgoings are available and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara can supply information on the average monthly expenditure.</P>
    <P>I want now to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that trawlers operating in the Galway-Aran district have experienced enormous increases in operating costs in the period July, 1973, to April, 1975.  I will give concrete examples under three headings.  One group consists of boats with an engine 75 to 150 horse-power using 250 gallons of diesel on average per week. The second group is the 150 to 240 horse-power using 500 gallons of diesel on average per week.  The third is the 240 to 550 horse-power using 1,000 gallons of diesel on average per week.  In the first group, the 75 to 150 horse-power, the cost of 250 gallons of fuel in July, 1973, was £17.50 a week.  It has increased to £59.91 now.  In the second group, the 150 to 240 horse-power using on average 250 gallons of fuel a week, the cost in July, 1973, was £35 a week; it has risen now to £119 a week. In the largest engined class up to 550 horse-power using 1,000 gallons on average per week the cost has increased from £70 in July, 1973, to £238, an increase of £168 per week. Multiply that figure by 52 weeks in the year and one will soon see where the fishermen have to meet heavy increases in costs.</P>
    <P>These figures were prepared for me by Comharchumann Iascairí na Gaillimhe agus Árann Teoranta showing the increases in operating costs <Col N="1674" /> in the Galway-Aran area.  The price of oil in Galway was 8.67 pence a gallon, less the rebate of 1.67 pence a gallon, leaving it at 7 pence per gallon in July, 1973.  VAT on the 10th July, 1973, was 5.26.  On 4th November, 1973, VAT was increased to 6.75.  There was a price increase of oil to 12.14p per gallon on 14th December, 1973.  From the 21st February, 1974, to the present time the price increased to 22.30p per gallon.  The increase in the price of oil in the Galway-Aran district from July, 1973, has been given by me already.</P>
    <P>Trawler operating costs also increased and I shall quote some figures to show this.  Average provision for weeks prior to July, 1973 amounted to £35 per week but for April, 1975 the amount had increased to £70 per week.  The rentals in respect of various equipment at April, 1975 were up by 20 per cent.  With regard to repairs to trawlers, the average charge prior to July, 1973 was approximately £1.50 per hour but in April 1975 it was £3 per hour and some fishermen tell me it is as high as £4 per hour.  As can be certified by the companies who sell fishing gear, the cost has risen by approximately 100 per cent; repayment on new vessels and the cost of building has increased by 100 per cent; in the same period the cost of painting and renewal work has increased by 100 per cent; overheads and replacement of engines and parts have increased in cost by 25 per cent. The cost of travel to and from ports by the skippers and crew has increased by 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>The demands of the fishermen are reasonable.  They have asked the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the Government will consider setting up a separate Ministry for Fisheries. They have asked to be consulted with regard to their demands for a 50-mile limit and they seek representation at Geneva.  It is extraordinary that the fishermen are not consulted by the Department in our representations at Geneva; they should be brought there as observers.</P>
    <P>Allowing the importation of fish from third countries outside the EEC <Col N="1675" /> cannot be tolerated.  We have been told by the fishermen that most of the prawns served in hotels at the dinners which the Labour and Fine Gael Ministers seem so happy to attend are imported from third countries.  The EEC regulations do not appear to apply to the importation of such products&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We hope the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will act in this matter and ensure that the deterioration in the situation is not allowed to continue.</P>

      <P>In the few minutes available to me I shall try to persuade the Parliamentary Secretary to change his mind with regard to this problem. We moved the Adjournment of the Dáil on this occasion for the purpose of highlighting a serious matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary has had an opportunity of discussing the situation with the fishermen.  The very least we might have expected from him was a positive, encouraging statement, that would show he knows something of the problems confronting these people. We were entitled to get an outline of the action he intends taking.  However, he did not do that.  He treated the House to the greatest exercise of buffoonery the House has witnessed for many years.  He sneered and laughed while the crowd behind him jeered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We expected that the Government would deal not only with this serious problem for the fishermen but also with the general problem of unemployment.  Fishing is an industry that could be extremely beneficial to our economy and could be of special benefit to the west.  The raw material is available.  It is an industry that employs male labour and it is an expanding industry.  However, it is facing a very steep dive, like every other industry and the Parliamentary Secretary cannot deny that fact.  Last week we tried to find out from him if the decision made with regard to fisheries was a Government decision. He told us it was his decision, that the Government had not decided.  In other words, he did not think it worth his while to bring the matter before the Government.  He took an arbitrary decision to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; when the question arose regarding the subsidising of fuel.</P>
      <P>It appears he wants audited figures. Does he deny fuel costs have increased 400 per cent since his Government have been in office?  Does he deny the cost of boats has increased by 200 per cent? The paltry few million pounds does not compensate for the rate of inflation and this is happening at a time of crisis, when we are faced with the greatest unemployment problem.  The House is entitled to something better than the nonsense we have listened to tonight when we are discussing one of the most progressive industries.  It is indicative of the Government's approach to industry generally; nothing is being done to help the people concerned.  There is much talk about the door being open, about the Government being prepared to meet the fishermen at any time, but the net result is that no help is given.  What are the Government of all the talents doing?</P>

Our balance of payments deficit is running at a very high figure and fisheries is one industry that can play a valuable part in reducing that figure.</P>
