      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government why a person in County Tipperary (name supplied) has not been paid a reconstruction grant; and when the grant will be paid.</P>

      <P>The grant in this case was paid to the applicant, c/o his solicitor on 20th December, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there was a mix-up in this case but can the Minister give any other reason for the delay in payment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long story.  A reconstruction grant was applied for in May, 1967 and this was renewed in January, 1971.  Because the house in question was practically rebuilt a reduced new house grant was applicable. First, the applicant was allocated a £400 grant but this was reduced by £77 because of defects in workmanship and by £50 in respect of a water supply.  Thus, the allocation was reduced to £273 and this amount was paid on 20th December, 1974.  The address on the 1967 application was given as Castle Place, Clogheen and on the later one as Ballinahalla, Clogheen.  The Deputy is aware that the applicant's son bears the same name as the father and has a similar address.  There was no mix-up.  When we were notified that the completed <Col N="1188" /> works had been examined the grant was paid c/o the man's solicitor to whom power of attorney had been given.  Perhaps the applicant is not aware that the solicitor got the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will indicate present Government policy in regard to home ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's policy to encourage home ownership on as general a scale as practicable. Effect is given to the policy by schemes of loans and grants, tax and rate concessions, to purchasers of private houses and by the generous terms of sales schemes introduced in July, 1973 for local authority houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered fully the wisdom of this matter of the sale of local authority houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I consider the decision to be wise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to concede that such a policy, if pursued to the full, would mean a continuance for ever of the situation of there being too few houses for those who need them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not be the case because it is the policy of the Coalition to build £25,000 houses a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will give to appropriate non-governmental organisations the opportunity to be consulted on questions of policy and planning affecting the protection of this country's architectural heritage together with financial support and encouragement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to consider any representations which may be made to me by non-governmental organisations in so far as they relate to any functions which I may have in relation to the architectural heritage. However, since most of the organisations likely to be interested in such matters are represented on the National Committee for European Architectural Heritage Year I doubt if it is necessary that any special consultation arrangements should be made.</P>
      <P>In any event, the matter is more directly related to the powers and functions of planning authorities. There are already adequate statutory arrangements to enable representations to be made and to ensure that such representations are considered by planning authorities when making or reviewing development plans.</P>
      <P>As regards financial support, planning authorities may consider, under section 14 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, assisting bodies or persons in their areas concerned with the preservation or development of amenities, including buildings of architectural interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that regardless of what steps planning authorities may take it remains of vital importance in this field that the public be made aware of the value of our national heritage? Can the Minister say whether he proposes to take any other steps to generate the interest and support of all sections of the community in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of supplementaries involved.  Finally, can the Minister say whether he is prepared to enlist the assistance of RTE in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy has in mind.  There has been more publicity given during the past few months to our architectural heritage than was ever given before. RTE played their part very well in this effort.  While everything possible is being done, the new Planning Bill which will be before the House again this afternoon, will give additional powers to planning authorities to do even more in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that local planning authorities are neither geared nor staffed for the adequate preparation of county development plans, can the Minister say whether he has any plans to assist them in this work, apart from merely having a review forwarded to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is fair to say that they have not the facilities. In my view most planning authorities are doing quite well.  There is not a big backlog at local level.  The backlog has occurred at national level because over the years there was a substantial volume of appeals.  When the new board takes over we will have to consider whether the facilities they have for posting appeals are adequate. If we find that they are not adequate alternative arrangements will have to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of the new board or any other procedures for appeal purposes, is the Minister satisfied that the work at local level, with the staff available and the calibre of that staff, is adequate to meet the purpose in order to reduce the burden on the appeals system?  This seems to have been the snag since the initiation of the Planning Act in 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter who is in that position they will have their own <Col N="1191" /> opinion as to how things should be done and I am not going to criticise the local officials who deal with planning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago I was informed by the Minister that schemes amounting to £26,000 were forwarded to the Department for approval last year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to be shouting because too much of it is done in this House.  When I asked the Minister about last year's allocation he blamed the local authority for not having sent up the schemes in time. The Minister then informed me that he had sanctioned schemes amounting to £26,000 but Galway County Council did not receive the £26,000. As far as the £74,000 for this year is concerned, there are a number of small schemes ready to go ahead but nothing can be done until we receive sanction from the Department.  When will this sanction be given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy or the local authority may be confused in this matter.  When I answered a question by the Deputy previously about <Col N="1194" /> this matter I informed him that in accordance with Circular 174 on procedures a local authority may submit in the last quarter of the year a programme of small schemes and schemes which cost less than £20,000 which it is proposed to carry out the following year.  By letter dated 20th December, 1974, received in the Department on 13th January, 1975, Galway County Council submitted details of their programme of small schemes for 1975 totalling £74,000.  Two further schemes were added by a submission received on 30th January, 1975 making a total programme of £100,000.</P>
      <P>As a few local authorities had submitted their programmes for 1975 a circular was issued to local authorities informing them that if they were to be considered for allocation of capital for such schemes in 1975 the necessary particulars would require to be submitted by 21st January, 1975. Local authorities have now submitted all their schemes.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it would be unfair to allocate grants to particular local authorities until we know what the overall position will be.  I assure the Deputy that as soon as I can&mdash;I hope in the next week or so&mdash;I will give the necessary information to his council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am worried about is the fact that we did not get the £26,000 for last year.  I would be satisfied if I was given a decision within a week.  I hope the year will not go by without the local authority being given a decision in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If a local authority submits an application at the end of the year in addition to what they have already asked for it is unreasonable that they should expect that it should be paid to them during that year.  I will write to the Deputy and give him the particulars, including the reference to the £26,000, in the course of the next few days so that he will know if we are talking about the same thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if all roads being repaired under rural improvements schemes which serve bog areas are eligible for a contribution of 10 per cent of the estimated cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised that where a bog is used by a large number of landholders, a problem may arise of ascertaining the total land valuation of each user for the purpose of determining the local contribution under the local improvements scheme. In such circumstances the county council may opt for a contribution by the beneficiaries totalling 10 per cent of the estimated cost of the scheme. County Councils were notified on 9th April, 1974 and again on 14th February, 1975, of their discretion in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the text of the circular that was issued to local authorities but I understood from a statement by the Minister that any roads leading to bogs would get off at the 10 per cent.  If there is difficulty in getting the valuations who will decide the matter?  This is a complicated question and it is being raised daily at local authority meetings.  The circular does not clearly define who qualifies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain amount of discretion is left to the local authorities and I think the Deputy will find that they will deal with this in a reasonable way.

      <P>The National Road Safety Association was granted corporate status on 8th April, 1974 under the National Road Safety Association (Establishment) Order, 1974.</P>
      <P>The functions assigned to the association are the promotion of road safety publicity and education.  The primary objective in this regard is to secure the greater co-ordination of road safety activities on a countrywide basis and an intensification of such activities with the maximum involvement of the community at local level.</P>
      <P>Driving tests were introduced on 18th March, 1964.  In 1963 there were 335 fatalities compared with 591 in 1974, an increase of 256.  There is no specific category of &ldquo;Serious Accidents&rdquo; in the accident statistics which are compiled under the headings, &ldquo;Fatal Accidents&rdquo;, &ldquo;Personal Injury Accidents&rdquo; and &ldquo;Material Damage&rdquo;. If the Deputy has &ldquo;Personal Injury&rdquo; accidents in mind, the figures recorded are: 4,422 persons injured in 1963 and 8,117 in 1974, the latter is a provisional figure.  I should point out that in comparing statistics of personal injuries between the years 1963 and 1974, it will be noted that a change was made in the system of reporting and recording accident information in 1968, when the definition of personal injury was extended to include minor injuries such as sprains and bruises.

We have had experiments with numerous types of signs over the last few <Col N="1201" /> years.  At present we are trying to get a sign on which a lot of work was done during the term of office of my predecessor and which I think should be a reasonable one.  Road signs in Ireland conform generally to international standards while taking account of national considerations such as the use of Irish on informative signs.

      <P>I can, if Deputy Lemass wants more information.  The UN Conference on the Human Environment was held in Stockholm in June, 1972.

Contributions made or pledged for 1973 amount to some 12 million dollars; the estimate for 1974 is about 21 million dollars and for the period 1973-77 about £100 million.  Ireland has intimated to the United Nations that a contribution will be made to the fund but the amount has yet to be finalised.  The fund is under the general control of a governing council for environment programmes comprising representatives of 58 member states, on a rotating basis. The second session of the governing council took place in Nairobi in March, 1974, and the third session is due to be held at the same venue in May, 1975.</P>
      <P>The fund is not intended to support development projects as much as international work in such areas as pollution monitoring and assessment, information exchanges, education and development of non-polluting technologies, with particular reference to work to be undertaken under the new UN environment programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> At this stage, as the country is neither a member of the governing council nor a contributor to the fund it is not in a position to exert influence. As regards policy, the development of the UN environment programme is being observed with a view to such participation or other action as may be appropriate.  An Foras Forbartha is active in a fund project&mdash;the development of an International Referral System under which environmental information centres are to be named in each country and linked together for exchanges.  This is part of a proposed UN Earthwatch system of international monitoring and development of information about pollution and the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall policy involves a number of Departments and the matter will fall to be considered by the Inter-Departmental Environment Committee.  My primary concern with <Col N="1206" /> waste is to ensure that the collection and disposal services provided by local authorities are operated adequately and efficiently from both the economic and environmental points of view.  I have taken a number of steps to this end.  I have asked local authorities to reorganise their operations using modern equipment and tipping methods to improve standards and efficiency, and I have drawn attention to the need for close supervision over private dumping operations.  I have also undertaken a general review of the adequacy of existing controls on waste collection and disposal to ascertain whether there is need for strengthening provisions to deal with emerging problems and to give effect to certain EEC directive proposals. Although recycling is not an area in which local authorities have any traditional role nor any statutory functions, I consider that they should also do what they can in the context of their waste operations to encourage and facilitate the recovery of useful materials from waste.  I have already made some suggestions to them in this area and other possibilities are being examined.  I have asked that the contribution which local authorities might make to recycling should be given priority in the continuation of research in relation to waste which An Foras Forbartha has undertaken.</P>

      <P>Might I say that I put this question down to the Taoiseach and I took issue with you, a Cheann Comhairle, because it was transferred to the Minister for Local Government?  I have realised since that it is not a matter for the Chair whether these questions are transferred, that it can be done without reference to the Chair.  Therefore, I should like to withdraw any suggestion I made yesterday.  Having said that, I would like to ask the Minister whether he would feel competent&mdash; I do not mean in his personal capacity but in his corporate capacity&mdash;to preside over Councils of Ministers of the Environment in so far as he is not in any real sense a Minister of the Environment himself?  Could I ask him also, if the European Community now see fit to have within the structure of the Community a Council of Ministers dealing with the environment, if there is any possibility that this Government now would recognise that what is urgent in Europe is even more urgent in Ireland?  If the Minister hears from his colleagues of the priceless asset we have in Ireland in our environment and the need to conserve and protect it, will he be influenced in recommending to the Taoiseach, to whom I put down this question, a separate Minister and Department of the Environment?</P>

      <P>First of all, Deputy O'Kennedy can be assured, since I am <Col N="1208" /> responsible for the environment I am interested in it and I have no doubt whatever how I will deal with the matters which will come up for discussion at the meeting.  When the previous Government were in office we had certain Ministers who took responsibility for doing things, about which they knew nothing whatever, but we accepted they were Ministers and that was that.</P>

      <P>I will preface what I have to say by saying I was not commenting on the individual capacity of the Minister and I am sorry he has seen fit to reply in that vein.  I put this question down not in the light of my own concern but of the concern of many people in the community.  The Minister has said he is responsible for the environment.  Does he not recognise that there are many other Ministers in the Government at present who, willy nilly, deal with aspects of our environmental protection?  For instance, what authority has the Minister with regard to the direction of industrial development in certain areas which will be consistent with good environmental planning?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the steps he proposes to take to alleviate the hardship arising in the cases referred to by him in a reply of 30th January, 1975 in which death duties have actually been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Revenue Commissioners nor the Minister for Finance, have any authority to repay death duties which have been properly paid in accordance with the relevant Acts of the Oireachtas.  As I indicated in my reply on February 13, 1975 (Official Report, Vol 278, No. 3, columns 563 and 564), provision is being made under existing legislation for the postponement of payment of duty in cases in which duty has been assessed but has not been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that in view of the fact that steps are being taken to alleviate to some extent the hardship <Col N="1213" /> suffered in cases where duty has not been paid that it is at least as important that steps be taken to alleviate the hardship recognised on all sides and agreed by the Minister in cases where duty has been paid?  Would he agree that the fact that legislation does not provide for this is not an insuperable obstacle, particularly having regard to the fact that legislation to deal with this precise problem was passed in Britain and that all the Minister needs to do is to amend the Finance Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>From the supplementary information I have at my disposal the only possible solution for this problem would be the enactment of legislation with retrospective effect. The drafting of such legislation would give rise to the problem of fixing an acceptable date.  If a date, say 1st June, 1973, were to be agreed, every case since then having stocks or shares would have to be reopened. This would lead to the repayment of considerable sums of duty, apart from the administrative burden involved. Only last night I had the opportunity of sitting in for the Minister when he went for his tea, and Deputy Haughey said that retrospective legislation was abhorrent so what can one do then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection to retrospective legislation is objection to the retrospective imposition of taxation not to the retrospective alleviation of taxation, for which there are many precedents.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary convey to the Minister for Finance the plea that he ought to amend the law to cover these cases which are at least equally suffering as the cases he proposes to help and that they should not be penalised merely because duty is paid?  Perhaps he would further convey to the Minister that as an effort to assist him I would propose to put down an amendment myself to the Finance Bill on the general lines required but no doubt the Minister with his advisers could do better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics are not available which would enable the information sought by the Deputy to be given.  However, the net receipt of income tax under PAYE in the calendar year 1974 was £171 million. As a consequence of the carry-over effect into 1975 of the terms of the national pay agreement, 1974, income increases related to grade, anomalies and other claims and the likely pattern of increases in empolyee remuneration if the terms of the proposed national pay agreement are implemented, it is estimated that the 1975 tax revenue under PAYE will be £266 million.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance when applications for grants under the EEC Regional Fund Scheme will be considered; and whether such grants will be allocated on a regional or county basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Council of Ministers of the European Communities last month formally adopted a regulation establishing the European Regional Development Fund, a supplementary budget which will enable the fund to approve the commitment of resources to projects put forward by member states and to make the necessary payments on foot of these commitments has not yet been adopted by the Community.  Until this has been done and necessary procedural arrangements for the submission of applications have been settled, the Commission will not be in a position to consider applications from member states.  Meanwhile work on the indentification of suitable projects for submission for assistance from the fund is continuing in my Department in consultation with the other Departments concerned.  As the Deputy is aware, the draft supplementary budget will authorise the fund to commit assistance to Ireland totalling approximately <Col N="1216" /> £8 million in 1975 of which only half will be paid in the course of this year.</P>
      <P>Projects undertaken anywhere in the State will qualify for assistance from the fund.  As this assistance will be on a specific project-by-project basis, grants will not be allocated on a regional or county basis.  The small size of the fund for the period 1975-77 will necessitate a very selective approach to the identification of projects. Within this constraint, however, the Government's intention will be to aim at the geographic distribution of projects which would best support Ireland's case for a very much larger fund after 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is indicated in the reply that there is no case made for any specific part of the country.  We must treat it as one entity so that when 1977 comes we will be in line for increased assistance from the fund. I know what the Deputy is getting at and I have an idea in my own mind as to what should be done but if you leave out any particular part of the country then we will not be in a position to argue for a greater increase in the fund aid after 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  If it is taken into the Exchequer the money must be used somewhere and to the best of our ability.  Of course, rural Deputies will try to get as much as they can as against, let us say, Leinster or Dublin or such places, but you must include those places so as to be eligible for a greater increase after 1977.</P>

They relate to such matters as the election of a Ceann Comhairle, the first meeting of the Dáil subsequent to a general election, the appointment of a Member to act temporarily as Ceann Comhairle, a motion to sit late, a motion to suspend a sitting, a motion to suspend a Member, a motion to discharge an order suspending a Member, closure <Col N="1222" /> of debate, to exclude visitors and the Press, to take Private Members' Time on a Tuesday or Wednesday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would submit that, under Standing Order No. 28, notice is necessary but that, with your permission, notice shorter than four days may be given.  The reason I am raising this is that Members of this House might wish to have an amendment put to the motion which has been moved and we are entitled to two days' notice to enable us to table an amendment. We are all in favour of the withdrawal of this Bill from the Dáil provided it is not being reintroduced in any other House.  We have no wish to oppose the motion for the Bill's withdrawal if that is to be the end of it but at least we wish to put an amendment to the motion if it is proposed, as appears to be the case, to reintroduce the Bill in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Because we have received no notice in writing, as required by the relative Standing Order, we are not in a position to put down the amendment. Therefore I ask that, in accordance with Standing Orders, you request the Minister to put the motion on the Order Paper so that the matter could be dealt with next week and that the House would have the opportunity of considering whether it wishes to put down an amendment.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to oppose a motion which we have never seen in writing and the first of which we heard was when the Minister moved it verbally.  Standing Orders allow two days for the tabling of <Col N="1223" /> amendments to motions.  The view of this party is that we would be anxious to table an amendment which would be agreeable to the withdrawal of this Bill from the Dáil but which would oppose its reintroduction in the Seanad.  We would wish to have the opportunity of tabling an amendment to that effect and to have the matter discussed.  It is a motion that can be passed only by the House.  We regard the Bill as being of considerable importance. We were glad to see that it was proposed to withdraw it from the Dáil but we are not happy for a number of reasons which I shall not go into now that it is proposed to reintroduce it in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I would draw your attention again, Sir, to the fact that Item No. 30 on the Order Paper which was called on the Order of Business is the motion for the Second Stage of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1974 and that that motion would be to the effect that the Bill be now read a Second Time. A different motion has been proposed by the Minister for Justice.  This should have been put in writing.  We would like an opportunity of tabling an amendment to the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If such is the ruling of the Chair we are firmly opposing the motion.  The Minister has said that this is a matter of extreme urgency and that, apparently, even a delay of one week is something that the Minister cannot contemplate.  To put it in its historical context this question of extra-territorial jurisdiction was mentioned in the Sunningdale Agreement and in the communiqué that issued from that agreement in December, 1973.  Subsequently the Law Commission <Col N="1226" /> was established and they reported in April, 1974.  The next we heard of any moves in this direction in this House was when the Bill was introduced on 28th November, 1974, almost 12 months after the Sunningdale Agreement.  On that occasion the Second Stage was ordered for the sitting of this House on 12th December, 1974.  The Minister now tells us that the matter is of such pressing urgency that even a further postponement of a week cannot be contemplated, but the facts speak for themselves.</P>
      <P>Obviously, it is not just a question of pressing urgency in time that has activated the Minister or the Government to introduce this at this stage.  It is the last surviving remnant of the Sunningdale Agreement but we are not opposing it on that basis though it was part of a package which no longer exists.  We are opposing it because this Bill has very far-reaching consequences and many provisions which we regard as unworkable and, possibly, unconstitutional. To introduce legislation which goes to the very jurisdiction of the State other than in the Dáil is showing a lack of understaning, awareness and appreciation of the role of this House and of the directly elected representatives who constitute the membership of this House.  It also shows a lack of awareness of the extent of the provisions and the consequences of the provisions proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding and lest anyone endeavours to suggest that Fianna Fáil are attempting to do anything other than to deal with people who are guilty of crimes of violence I should like to make it clear that we have very firm proposals to be put forward as an alternative to this legislation.  They are firm and workable proposals.  We are very concerned for the peace and security of all of this island and for that reason we propose in view of the fact that this Bill is unworkable for many reasons that the only effective way of achieving the result the Government presumably have in mind would be an all-Ireland court with jurisdiction to deal with the offences throughout the whole of the island and authority and control over the police forces concerned. <Col N="1227" /> The only guarantee of fundamental rights in any situation is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the motion for the discharge of the Order of the Second Stage of this Bill is now being formally opposed but I must advise the House that if a debate is to ensue the debate must be confined to the merits of the proposed move, the withdrawal of the Bill from this House and its introduction in the Seanad.  That is the subject matter and I cannot allow a debate on the merits or demerits of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When this was put on the Dáil Order Paper, because of our concern about this matter, we went to the trouble within the committee of our party to study this Bill in great detail and put forward what we regarded as being positive and responsible amendments to this Bill.  If this motion goes through we will be deprived of that opportunity and the State deprived of the responsibility of our approach.  The country will suffer if our proposals are not presented here which is the directly elected Assembly of this State.  If we are not entitled to do that we have reached a sad state.  This Bill goes to the jurisdiction of the institutions of the State. The Government, when 12 months have elapsed, inform the House that this is a matter of urgency and expect us to agree to their high-handed action.</P>
      <P>We want to see human rights and human life, in particular, being protected and it is because we believe that this Bill cannot do that and that our proposals would ensure that it can be done properly and effectively by a proper court structure and proper supervision over the police that we oppose this motion.  We are particularly concerned to guarantee fundamental human rights and there is evidence to suggest they are not being guaranteed or protected as much as they might be.</P>

      <P>The reason, as I said, is that the business for this House is heavy.  There is a lot of business awaiting discussion at various stages and it is extremely difficult to fit in this Bill, because of its importance and its far-reaching implications to which Deputy O'Kennedy has referred, <Col N="1229" /> and have it debated and completed within a reasonable time.  It would then have to go to the other House and it seemed to me that the common-sense approach was to go first to the Upper House where time is available and have it processed in the Upper House and that it should then come back here, in the hope that by that time some of the log jam here would have been cleared and we could get it dealt with expeditiously.

It sets out that these motions must be in writing and on pages 132 and 133 of the index there is set out a list of the motions which need not be in writing and of which notice is not required.  A motion to discharge a Bill is not one of them.  Therefore, because it is not in this list of motions, if the Minister wants to move it, he will have to put it in writing.  It is up to the Chair then to agree or not to agree whether he can do this on less than four days' notice, but we have not reached that stage yet as we have not got the motion in writing.

      <P>On a point of order, in view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, and for his recollection I would have the greatest regard, does he seriously expect the House and the Chair to accept that a happening three weeks ago which is not similar creates a precedent for this unusual situation today?  In the other case, it was a matter of agreement but it is being regarded as a precedent for what is being done today.  Does he seriously expect this House and the Chair to accept that a happening three weeks ago which was not similar creates a precedent for <Col N="1233" /> this unusual situation here today? The thing is daft; three weeks ago, one happening, by agreement, and it is regarded now as a precedent for what is being done here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been very obvious from the manner in which the Government have attempted to put down this motion that, in fact, it has been done in great haste for some reason best known and known only to the Government.  We on this side of the House can have our own opinions as to why that is so.  If the Minister is seriously trying to suggest to us here that a Bill which was, in fact, introduced in November is now <Col N="1234" /> a matter of such pressing urgency that not even a further week can elapse, then, of course, that just cannot be accepted, is not a fact and certainly does not commend the Minister's honesty or integrity in the manner in which he has presented it now.  We are concerned for the responsibility we have, as the directly elected representatives of the people of this State, to ensure that we shall be the first people to express views on legislation of this nature which cuts into the very heart of our jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Let it not be suggested by anyone that Fianna Fáil have not been consistent because when it did come to taking steps we did so alone without very much assistance from the present components of the Government. Therefore, there can be no interpretation of that nature and I want to make that very clear.  Our approach to this Bill, when it is introduced&mdash;as I hope it will be if the Minister now has second thoughts&mdash; in the first instance, in this House of the Oireachtas will prove that to be the case.  Of course, it is a delicate time.  We know it is a delicate time. It always has been a delicate time in this country over the past number of years, in the North of Ireland particularly. We are particularly concerned that nothing that would be done or said in either House of the Oireachtas would do anything other than heal wounds and promote peace.  We would have wanted the opportunity to do just that in co-operation with positive institutions which will guarantee not just that people be punished for committing offences&mdash;and, of course that must be done&mdash;but also, and even more important, that people be protected in their fundamental human rights. That is what this Bill will not do.  Our alternatives will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister must recognise that if he is spokesman for his Government in this House, the least we would be entitled to is that our spokesman concerned in this would have the same right to express our view in this House as the Minister will have when he goes to the Seanad, if that is his <Col N="1235" /> wish.  If the Minister wishes to do that, they have the votes on that side to try to do so.  But let them know that in trying to do so, or in succeeding they are doing a disservice to the House, to the security of the State and indeed, to the very thing they may be pretending to implement, peace and order throughout the whole of this island.  We firmly oppose this step.  If they want to withdraw this motion, we are in favour of it or withdraw this Bill but not on the conditions the Minister announced subsequently of re-introducing it in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The motion was introduced by the Minister for Justice.  I understood the Minister to very clearly indicate, as an aside&mdash;at the end of having introduced the motion&mdash;that it was his intention, and he merely made it by way of public announcement, not as part of the <Col N="1240" /> motion, to have the Bill introduced in the Seanad.  Therefore, I am amazed that somebody who professes to have an erudite knowledge of Standing Orders and who was chairman of an informal Committee on Dáil procedure, namely, Deputy O'Malley, should rise to debate this matter and decide that, since his party did not particularly like the Bill, it should be opposed.</P>
      <P>He had a very simple remedy.  I see no reason why they cannot agree to this motion.  They have discovered after 40 minutes of debate on the motion that they cannot oppose it.  If they wanted to oppose it they could vote against it and make themselves look more stupid than they have been in the past 40 minutes.  Looking around, there seems to be a gap of about 30 or 40 Deputies over there which would account for their prolonging this debate unduly.  The Minister is quite within his rights in proposing that the Bill be discharged and it is open to him to exercise his discretion to move it to the Seanad.  The Opposition are trying to have it both ways.</P>

The Government could arrange to have it put on the Order Paper for next week, circulate it in the meantime in order that we may submit appropriate amendments. There is a naïve approach to this.  We are told it is none of our business what legislation the other House may take.  We welcome the withdrawal of this Bill from the Order Paper provided it is not reintroduced in the other House.</P>

In all the circumstances, I think the correct thing to do would be to adjourn this until next week, have it put on the Order Paper, circulate the <Col N="1241" /> motion, which I am convinced should, under Standing Orders, be circulated anyhow.  Even though it is introduced at short notice here, it still should be in writing and circulated.  I suggest in all sincerity that this matter should be adjourned until next week.</P>

The Government are not prepared to give any such undertaking and are not prepared to withdraw this Bill from the Oireachtas.  The Opposition know that it was pointless to make that request. They know that well, because Deputy O'Kennedy went on to talk about the consequences of not proceeding with it in this House but taking the initiative in the other House.  There were two things implicit in what he said, one was that the debate in the other House would be in some way less efficient, deep or less worthwhile, and I consider that to be a reflection on the other House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I could not agree more, and that is what I did, a Cheann Comhairle.  When you called Item No. 30, I moved the motion and the debate then opened. Deputy O'Malley talked about putting down an amendment that would seek to tie the hands of the Government as to what it would or would not introduce in another House, which, of course, was quite out of order.  There was then a suggestion that I might withdraw the Bill altogether, and I have indicated that that is not the Government's intention.  It was further suggested that I might postpone the debate on this motion for a week, and I have indicated I cannot agree to that suggestion either.  Deputy O'Kennedy, who spoke at some length on the matter, criticised the motion on the grounds that it would in some way inhibit the debate on this very important measure.  I am answering that criticism, because it implied that the other House would be a less worthy forum in which to commence this debate. I do not accept that, and this afternoon's proceedings prove my point.  The other point he made was that the matter was so important that it should be debated in this House.  It will be debated in this House and has to be debated here.  It might be an advantage that it would come back to this House having been teased out and analysed in the other House.  I take his point that this is the House where Members are elected by the people, but if it so happens that the amount of legislation being processed has so cluttered up the timetable of the House that it is not <Col N="1244" /> possible to get in this important Bill, then it is only common sense that it would be brought to the other House where there is time, and that it would come back here in due course. There is financial business before this House which has to be completed before a certain date.  The Opposition do not want this Bill and are trying to use this procedural debate to get it withdrawn.  The Bill will not be withdrawn, and I cannot agree to postpone this motion.  It is a simple motion.  An amendment to it would be quite daft because this House cannot bind the Government to what they introduce in the Seanad.  It is a matter for the Opposition.  If they want to oppose it they can do so.</P>

      <P>I think that here we have a very serious constitutional matter.  Here is an example of a resort to legal and procedural devices to defeat the proper and frank discussion, in the first instance, in this House of a matter of vital public importance.  Incidentally, to suggest it was on a par with the Wildlife Protection Bill, as the Parliamentary Secretary suggested, is either a confession of a complete lack of realisation by the Dáil and the Government of the importance of what is involved in this, both constitutionally for us here, nationally for the country and for the minority in Northern Ireland, or else it is a despicable and a panic device to complete something that some people would prefer did not see the full light of day.  I will answer Deputy Desmond first.  Yes, we wanted this Bill out because we thought it was not the right Bill for this purpose and Deputy O'Kennedy has explained our attitude but we do not want it out as a result of a procedural device to facilitate political maneouvre on a matter of such vital importance.  For that reason this motion is, in the first instance, objectionable and suspect.  It is cleverly worded and I am surprised at the Minister, who is lawyer, walking <Col N="1245" /> into the trap.  It was only because of Deputy O'Malley's tenacity that the Seanad was brought in at the end.  If the Minister had not brought in the question of the Seanad I would be out of order in referring to it and I would simply have to accept that the Bill was being withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I am entitled to ask this question, since the Minister has referred to the matter.  What possible merit is there in taking the Bill out of this House, bringing it to the Seanad and bringing it back here?  Where will time be saved?  Can we not sit an extra day? I see time being filled in with Planning Bills and other Bills that are not of the same importance.</P>

      <P>I am and there are others who are.  Perhaps it is a good thing to reflect on past experience. This is a matter of vital importance and the approach of this Minister, in particular, the very Minister, who, when he was in Opposition, took a particular view, if all the reports are right, on the famous night when this party were in Government passing a Bill to deal with these problems, is a very suspect maneouvre.  He introduced a Bill in November which has been lying there since then.  It is well known that we want it withdrawn because we have other proposals. <Col N="1246" /> Deputy O'Kennedy explained the attitude of this party.  This Bill has been there since then, so why the sudden urgency?  Who is pushing the matter?  These are questions to which the House is entitled to have answers, quite apart from the fact that the Minister will be free to say what he likes in the Seanad without having to face the Opposition in this House.</P>

Therefore, without elaborating and keeping within the rules of order, on the question of the actual issue involved, the suggestion that this Bill is on a par with the Wildlife Bill is ludicrous but it does serve the purpose of a comparison of the actual importance of the matter that is before us, the importance for the State here, the importance for law and order, the importance for continuity, the importance for our relations with the North, the importance for the whole country, the importance for the Unionists in the North.</P>

      <P>I do not want to labour this point&mdash;on this motion it would be improper to go into details&mdash; beyond emphasising as strongly as I can the intrinsic importance of the subject matter, the disservice the Minister is doing in even provoking this debate here when he could very easily have dealt with the matter.  There has been a Bill on the stocks since November.  Then he comes in with <Col N="1248" /> what has all the appearance of a dirty trick.  It has that appearance.  I am sure the Minister does not intend that.  If the Minister had courage and came in here and said straight out what the problem and the urgency is I am sure he would get the co-operation of the whole House with possibly one exception.</P>
      <P>Passing from that vital point, I object to this motion.  I am not going to fall for Deputy Desmond's slickness here.  There is a distinction.  Yes, we do want the Bill withdrawn but we do not want it formally withdrawn here as a device to slip through somewhere else and to get it round the corner.</P>

We want the Bill withdrawn, yes, and to get down to realities but we do not want that same Bill withdrawn here and then brought around by the back door after you have all the rest of it and then coming in here after the commitments.  We have had enough of that kind of procedure with the Finance Act.  We have had the Minister for Finance bringing in a whole financial revolution in little steps, getting it through in steps before one knows what the next step is and committing us all along the way with something that we should have seen in totality, as I pointed out last night.  Here is another device to make a joke of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am on the second leg.  My first objection is on the grounds of national importance.  My second objection is on the grounds of the wrecking of constitutional procedure and the further reduction of the Parliament of the people to the role of a rubber stamp and an electoral college.  This House is now and I am afraid has long since been reduced to the stage of being merely an electoral college for a Government and then it is asked to rubber stamp everything that that Government brings in until that Government go out again.  Here is another milestone in that deterioration. Here is the primary House, the directly representative House of the <Col N="1249" /> people and a matter of public importance is being filched away from it and is going around the other way.  It is only another part of the same process, the same dismantlement of the democratic process that is going on here.</P>
    <P>On another Bill I talked about doctrinaire socialism and socialist principles.  This is another step of this doctrinaire approach which will not stop at that.  The word &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; will quickly turn to another &ldquo;ism&rdquo; before it is finished.  I am very serious and very concerned that this is just another move in the nature of the dismantlement of the democratic process.</P>
    <P>I am putting these two important points before the House, not wishing to delay the House further on the motion.  Having said essentially what is to be said on it, I would like even at this late stage to make an appeal to the Taoiseach, an appeal which Deputy Joe Brennan has already made.  Can we not learn from our history?  Can we not learn from the experience of democracy in our House?  Can we not learn from all it has cost to set up a real democracy here and a real Parliament?  Can the Minister for Justice not face the House?  Can he not come in and stand there, not sit around at the side, and say to us, &ldquo;This is our problem&rdquo;? Can he not do that and can he not let the House then decide?  Can he not let the process work?</P>

If the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1250" /> would allow me to talk in a more contemplative fashion, as I would like to, and not stimulate me to reply to him in his own idiom, we would get a little bit further.  I do want to appeal to the Taoiseach.  We understand the Government's problem.</P>

      <P>An awful lot has gone in, and nobody knows better than the Taoiseach what has gone in to build up a Parliament here and to make it effective.  In the last analysis, the Government that destroys the power and the support of the Parliament is isolating itself and putting itself in other power.  It is depriving itself of support.  It is not protecting itself. The Minister who tries to evade the House is not protecting himself. He is laying himself at the mercy of other forces and other influences.  It is here where his strength should be and here where every Minister who is worthy of his office will find his strength.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; on those matters, although there were strong differences of opinion I do not think any Minister whether he was on that side or on this side can complain that the support he got from the House at the end was not effective support and that that support was not given.  I see this as another sinister step in the dismantling of the democratic process, to the detriment of the people we represent. This is a move which will deprive them of information and ultimately a move which will deprive the Government of the support they should have.  Whether this motion is or is not passed, this whole incident here today is a misfortune for which the Minister must take full responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He will complain.  He will blame us. He will blame the Opposition.  He is a clever lawyer.  He will have all the answers.  Let him reflect that in the last analysis he and nobody else is to blame.  I regret it.  It is bad nationally <Col N="1251" /> and it is bad for the House that all this should happen here today.  I am disturbed personally that I have had to speak as I have had to speak. Following on the constitutional aspect apart from the national aspect, this highlights more than ever the need for this House to think about itself. Deputy Desmond is the author of a complaint about the Dáil and its procedures. It is a very interesting document.</P>

      <P>I would ask Deputy Desmond to consider how far the failings of this House are due to the evasion of the democratic process by those in power, how far they are due to professionalism in politics, and how far they are due to dogmatic approaches whether from the socialistic or any other point of view. What is being done today is, in essence, the type of thing Deputy Desmond complained about, the type of thing which is making democracy ineffective and taking business away from this House.  In other words, the representatives of the people will be prejudiced.  They will not be deprived because it will come back here anyway.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can give the answers.  He is an expert on them.  We want to warn against these devices.  This motion is in many ways a dangerous precedent and a most regrettable manoeuvre.  It would be futile to ask the Minister to withdraw it.  The Minister should remember that what damage has now been done&mdash; and damage has been done&mdash;is his fault and solely his fault.  Facing us and the country frankly and putting everything straight before the people, <Col N="1252" /> instead of this backdoor method, would have saved everybody embarrassment and would have prevented the scene we have had in the House today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like to observe in this debate, if debate we can call it, is that I am still rather doubtful whether there is any motion before the House.  In fact, I wonder whether the House is properly in session at all.  Since some such operation is proceeding as if there is a debate and, therefore, presumably some sort of motion is before the House which would originally have been introduced by the Minister when he was called on Item No. 30&mdash;of course, if he reneges on this I will accept his word&mdash;I clearly understood him to stand up and say, if not in actual words then in words understood by me to convey, that he wished to withdraw the Bill for the purpose of bringing it to the Seanad, and he went on further&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, what I said was that if the motion were to be agreed it was my intention to introduce the Bill in the Seanad tomorrow and to circulate it.  I indicated that on a point of information for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My hearing must not only be bad but also my capacity to understand what has been said must be even worse.  I should like to point out to the Chair on a point of order that, if this is the fact&mdash;and I accept that it is the fact&mdash;the Minister has now said that there was a proposal on being called on Item No. 30 that if there was agreement to the withdrawal of the Bill he would proceed to do so and would introduce it in the Seanad. There has not been agreement and, therefore, what he originally proposed cannot possibly be before the House, and has not been requested to be put before the House even by the Minister himself.  Is this so or is it not, a Cheann Comhairle?  This is a point <Col N="1253" /> on which I should like clarification. The Minister now asserts that on being called on Item No. 30 he indicated and proposed that if he got agreement on the withdrawal of the Bill he would proceed to do so and introduce it in the Seanad.  He has not got agreement and, therefore, what is this about?  Could I have something from the Ceann Comhairle on this because I am totally at sea in this matter at the moment?</P>
      <P>Perhaps I might repeat it for the benefit of the Chair.  As I now understand it, the situation as further clarified by the Minister is that on being called on Item No. 30 by the Chair he indicated to the House that he wished with agreement to withdraw the Bill and that he would introduce it in the Seanad.  He did not get agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I should like to make the matter perfectly clear.  I moved the motion that the order for the Second Stage be discharged and that I would be given leave to withdraw the Bill.  By way of explanation and for clarification for the House I then said that, if that were agreed, I proposed to introduce the Bill in the Seanad tomorrow and to circulate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am sorry to be taking up your time but the Minister has now again utterly confused the situation.  He has now contradicted what he gave as a correction a few short minutes ago.  What are we on if we cannot take what the correction was?  It has now been further corrected.  Are we back to where I started which is that the Minister wishes to withdraw the Bill so that he can reintroduce it in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing has been corrected. I have repeated for at least the fourth or the fifth time the motion I moved when you, Sir, called Item No. 30 at 4 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so my recollection is quite correct, that is, that it would be discharged and the Minister would reintroduce it in the Seanad.  That is what we are supposedly <Col N="1254" /> debating here at the moment. I submit absolutely and completely and vehemently that there is no motion before the House at the moment and that this is totally and absolutely contrary to Standing Orders and to procedure and precedent established over the years.  Our continuing to take up the time of Parliament on whether or not the matter is proper, and whether it should or should not be discharged is totally at variance with Standing Orders and procedure and precedent established over many years.  We are put into this dilemna: we are now being obliged to discuss something which is not and should not be before us and is not properly before us.</P>
      <P>What has been said from the Fianna Fáil benches has been most welcome to me in that we now have from the Opposition, which is larger than any other party in the House, a clear indication that, despite any conclusion that may have existed in or around the time of the Sunningdale Agreement and the first public emergence of this proposed type of cross-Border legislation and cross-Border law enforcement, Fianna Fáil, the Opposition in this House and by far the largest party in the country, commanding by far the greatest percentage of voters and allegiance, are now four square against this for many reasons many of which they are not entitled to give in full detail here today because of this queer situation in which we find ourselves.  We do not know whether we are in order or out of order, whether there is a motion before us or whether there is not.  If there is a motion before us we do not know what exactly the motion is.  The Minister has given three different versions of what he himself allegedly said at the commencement of these proceedings this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the largest party in the House have now clearly on the constitutional, the national and in the interests of the minority of the Six Counties come out four square against the concept that was peddled during the Sunningdale Agreement which is culminating now in this type of Bill, which the House is now <Col N="1255" /> asked to discharge so that it can be brought in by the back door and all the attendant propaganda and the Government majority used to try to brainwash our people into an acceptance of something they in their right minds would totally reject, something that would cause them to revolt physically and wipe out any Government which would try to perpetrate this trick on them.  Constitutionally the individual has no standing whatsoever as we have found recently.  Whether it be a matter of public importance or individual personal importance there is no right under our Constitution as operated by our Supreme Court and our High Court to guard the individual. I instance the case that Kevin Boland took in the public interest, for which he has been hammered into the ground.</P>

There is nothing to which we can pin ourselves and when we ask we are given further explanations, for which I thank the Minister, but, unfortunately, his further explanations tend only to further confuse the utter confusion that started here at four o'clock this afternoon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what is before the House.  It was rather what was tendered to the House by the Minister in the first instance and he cannot now mend his fences by merely after hearing the objections of the Fianna Fáil Party spokesman to the procedure, avoiding the most objectionable part of it, which was the reference to its reintroduction in the Seanad, and that he did at five minutes past four.  Let there be nobody under any illusions about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> I say constitutionally we can write that off as far as the individual is concerned and I am delighted that the biggest party in this House opposes this, instancing the lack of constitutionality that lies within the proposed legislation because the individual has no right.  He is blackguarded out of that right by punitive costs levied on him, designed to deter any individual, no matter how he may feel about any matter, from going to the courts to try to safeguard his interests or the interests of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>A party of the dimensions of the Opposition cannot be ignored and cannot be deterred and I, therefore, welcome on the constitutional submissions by the spokesmen for the Opposition their views in this matter because it is not with impunity that the Government can now proceed here in this House or in the Seanad with any measure of a nature such as that which they intend to bring in here for reasons best known to the Minister and the Government.  It is now being backtracked and shoved in through the back door.  Nationally, it would be a disaster if this particular legislation should ever see its way on to the Statute Book.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, and I am merely following what has been pointed out since we started here at approximately two minutes past four. The national, constitutional minority interests in the Six Counties have all been talked about already and what has been said is on the official record so I do not think I am going outside the bounds in referring to things that have already been discussed without any indication from the Chair that the points raised were out of order.  I say that with no disrespect to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle but merely in explanation of my point of view and I am putting my view on the record in furtherance of the point of view in relation to this matter already expressed by other speakers.  That is why I say it would be a national disaster should we have this legislation in any form, whether it starts here or <Col N="1257" /> comes in through the back door via the Seanad, propagandised to the extent of brainwashing the public into an acceptance of it, confusing them to such a degree that they may be ready to accept something they would never contemplate in their sane senses, irrespective of what Government might be in office.  I say a &ldquo;national disaster&rdquo; for the simple reason that the introduction of this kind of legislation, recognising a cross-Border operation in which we would have the RUC, totally discredited as they have been, and so accepted and branded down the years since 1969, becoming prime witnesses.  The British Army in regard to whose role in the Six Counties even those most charitably disposed to the British occupation cannot accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>By his interjection the Minister has bogged himself down further in the confusion that he has tended to create since he introduced this motion at 4 o'clock.  As has been said already by another speaker, any loss of time or prestige that results from the Minister's mishandling of the situation&mdash;and I doubt that this was deliberate on his part but arose merely from lack of experience in the House &mdash;is of his own making.  Having put his foot in it, he tried to mend the situation but then put his other foot in it and is <Col N="1260" /> so bogged down now that he does not know whether he is coming or going. What he has endeavoured to do was wrong from the start.  It is not in accordance with the tradition or procedure of this House and, certainly, is contrary to Standing Order No. 28.</P>
      <P>Where are we going in regard to this matter?  This whole situation arises on a matter that will be ranted and raved about by the Minister and his supporters as further evidence of this Government's concern for law and order although their very exercise in this House is a total negation of the very roots of where law and order should come from, namely, this Parliament of the people.  This Government ignore what does not suit them and when they find the going heavy, they change the wording so as to conform with something that might have been.  They circulate this motion by way of note of which not even the Ceann Comhairle has a copy, much less the Members.  As a matter of courtesy, we are entitled to a copy of the motion so that we might contribute to the debate.  This is a disastrous effort in the working of democracy in the House.

      <P>Despite the diversion tactics at which some Members of the Government are adept, namely, of creating a situation, worsening it and then blaming it on somebody else so as to get the Chair on their side to do their bidding, I wish to say these few words lest the Government may move more quickly than we might anticipate in an effort to bring to a closure this situation which, for them, is embarrassing. From a national point of view, if this matter is introduced and put on our Statute Books there will be at hand an immediate and clear recipe which will bring about that which has been avoided on this side of the Border for the past six years and out of which there will be no path, namely, the violence with all its resultant difficulties, hardship and sacrifice that is being experienced in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Government whether that is one of the purposes of trying to enact this Bill.  Are they desirous of extending the problems and the difficulties to this part of the country so that there may be justified on their part concerted action outside that which, clandestinely, they are doing now&mdash; trying to have their little say and to <Col N="1262" /> sell out to the British as is their wont and as has been their practice during many years past?  Do we want a situation created by way of the Seanad in which some weeks from now there will be before us a proposal which may, after a couple hours of debate, be closured and pushed through?  This is conceivable.  Indeed, the ground for this may well have been laid by the Minister and by other Members of the Government who have been making the case that because of pressure of business in this House, the matter should go to the Seanad.  It must come back here when it is bound to take up as much, if not more time, than it would take now.  If there is to be a shortcut in the time devoted to this debate in this House, it can only be at the expense of the right of Members to contribute adequately to the various debates that such a measure might entail.</P>
    <P>Can we have an undertaking that there will be no closure if this device of going round by the back door so as to come back here again is used? Will we get an undertaking that there will be no curtailment on debate ultimately?  If there is such an undertaking how can there be a justification advanced by the Minister for Justice that it will save time?  Time cannot be saved in that way.  I challenge the Government as to what this device is being used for?  What is the purpose and motive underlying withdrawing this matter which up to now has not been urgent in any degree?  Far from it, it has been lying on the Order Paper for weeks and was in the air for a year but now we find that there are not even days to spare to go through the proper procedure of written notice.</P>
    <P>What are the Government up to? Why is this happening?  Who is putting the finger on the Government and for what purpose is the finger being put on?  Are the British Government telling our Government what to do as I assert they told the Fianna Fáil Government what to do in 1970?  It is because of my knowledge of what happened then and the British Government's role that I suspect and fear that the real purpose and motive behind the urgency now, and the <Col N="1263" /> backdoor methods of enacting this, is because the British Government have the thumb on this Government.</P>

      <P>Are we ever to get away from the time when the British, whether on this side of the Border or the occupied side of the Border, are going to call the tune behind the scenes and let somebody else take the rap for it.  Is that what is in question now?  If it is then, as Deputy de Valera has indicated, the Minister would do better service to his Government and his country to say that he wants to take the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas because he is under pressure from the British Government to do it.  If he did that there would be some merit in getting on with it even by those who oppose it but there is no merit in the arguments advanced by the Minister.  They are so lacking in conviction that they would be laughable were it not for the fact that they concern a very serious matter.</P>
      <P>Can we envisage a situation where we are going to have the SAS as witnesses in our courts on this side of the Border or the RUC, SIB or British army personnel in their various forms? Can we envisage them telling some of our chief superintendents that so-and-so is a member of the IRA in the Six Counties and then our chief superintendent informing the court that he believes that person is a member of the IRA with the result that he is sent &ldquo;up the river&rdquo; for a year?  Are we mad?  Are we stark raving mad to contemplate anything as daft as this? Are we so mad that we are now going to allow it to be brought in and propagandised through the big majority of the Government in the Seanad?  The two Houses of the Oireachtas are complementary and the Seanad has always been looked upon and justified in regard to its continuing existence as being the place where a second thought and a second look can be taken at legislation before it is returned to this House for further consideration and due deliberation, but on the second time round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> This has been said on many occasions but in this case one of the most dangerous and important pieces of proposed legislation already on our Order Paper is being taken off and introduced in the Seanad.  This is a crazy and a dangerous situation and one for which we have received no explanation that stands up for a second.  Can we consider the impact that the passage of any such legislation, no matter which form it takes, can have?  We should think back to the most recent indication of how abhorrent any such legislation would be to our people.  We all read about Lord McDermott's recent verdict which was to the effect that the British army can do no wrong, not even murder.  Apparently they can do no wrong even if they take a man out of his house, move him to a field and shoot him in front of his father.  Are we prepared to have that?</P>

We do not know what the division is about and I wonder if the Chair knows.  Did the Chair hear what the Minister had to say?  I did not hear the Minister or the Chair and I do not know what is before the House.  This is the end in so far as order and procedure in this House is concerned and the Chair is a party to the perpetration of the situation. This matter should and must be considered further and cannot be abrogated by the Chair or by the Minister saying they will have no more discussion. It is a scandal if this is the case and the Chair must be totally misled if he believes he is serving the interests of this House by behaving in the manner he has by giving way to a Government whose law and order precept is: &ldquo;Do as we wish you to do and if you do not we will make you.&rdquo;  That is what is being done and the Chair, wittingly or unwittingly, is a party to it and does not give us the opportunity of knowing what is going on.</P>

    <P>We did not hear a word of what was going on but we are told now that the motion is being put.  This is a scandalous travesty of the rights of Deputies and the Chair should tell the House why he condones that sort of operation and allows the Government to dictate to him on a matter as important as this, a matter which has a doubtful beginning and a doubtful origin.  It is a motion which in all essence was never properly before the House.  The Chair has not dealt with that.  The Chair is blatantly ignoring the rights of the House and ignoring its role of referee in the middle to give fair play and, in fact, is helping the Government to perpetrate their <Col N="1267" /> will on this House by whatever device they choose to adopt, regardless of Standing Orders.</P>

I warn the Chair and I hope that Deputies over here will do likewise because of the treatment of Members of the Opposition here through the Chair.  It is a disgrace and a scandal and something the House will regret, and not the least to regret it will be the man responsible for the order of this House, the Ceann Comhairle.  The Chairman of this House is a lackey of the Minister as displayed here today and is doing no service to the House, to Parliament, to democracy or the preservation of order or procedure in the future.  Give the Government their way and you will live to regret it and will have call to regret it from outside in the not very distant future&mdash;no fairness, no justice and no opportunity being given for fair debate in the House.  I want the House to be fully alive to the fact that we are being blackguarded and straitjacketed by the order of the Chair, at the behest of the Minister and the Government, in a manner which was never contemplated, should not be tolerated, and which will have its repercussions so long as this Chairman and this Government remain in office which I hope in both cases may not be very long, even though the alternative might not be all that attractive either.  The Chair on this issue does a disservice to the very essence of order and his role will go down in history as the beginning of the end of orderly procedure in the House.</P>

    <Title>Land Bond Bill, 1975: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> In the course of my speech introducing the Bill on 19th March and again in the course of my concluding remarks I pointed out that the Bill is an enabling one, to enable the Minister for Finance to create a further issue of land bonds to the extent of £20 million in nominal value should he so wish.  As of now the ceiling for the creation of land bond issues is £40 million and with the creation of the issue of £1 million in 16 per cent land bonds earlier this year the ceiling of £40 million has been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to give authority to the Minister for Finance to create further issues of land bonds not exceeding £20 million.  As I have gone to some trouble to point out, it is an <Col N="1277" /> enabling measure.  The Minister may, if he so wishes, create further issues of land bonds to the extent of £20 million or he may not create any further issues.  In the course of the debate certain criticisms were levelled at land bonds.  It is fair to say that no one in the Opposition argued that land bonds could be done away with immediately.  Deputy Callanan and Deputy Carter, in particular, realised that this was not possible.</P>
    <P>I was requested to phase out land bonds.  In the course of my remarks I told the House that I was engaged in the operation of phasing out land bonds and that I was anxious that the day would come when all land purchased by the Land Commission, compulsorily or voluntarily, should be paid for in cash but I emphasised that in the prevailing economic climate it was not possible to move from land bonds into cash in one step.  Since I became Minister for Lands I feel I have made very considerable progress towards substituting cash for land bonds.  In 1972-73 only £225,000 was provided by the former Government and £100,000 of that was borrowed from the salaries account, which meant effectively only £125,000 was provided by the Exchequer under the heading of &ldquo;Land Purchase, 1972-73&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In 1973-74 the House voted £1 million for the purchase of land in cash and for this full year of 1975 we have available for the purchase of land under the retirement scheme and on an ordinary voluntary basis approximately £3,800,000 in cash.  It is necessary to repeat that the amount that is provided for the purchase under the retirement scheme is, of course, provided by the Irish taxpayer and no amount of the purchase price of land comes from the EEC Fund.  It will be agreed, therefore, that while we have not got away from land bonds altogether and while it is necessary to continue them, we are moving in the direction in which we all wish to go.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to spend very much time dealing with the retirement scheme but it is proceeding nicely and even in this year will make a very worthwhile contribution towards the creation of a pool of land for the <Col N="1278" /> relief of congestion.  I told the House the last day that applications under the scheme total 1,200.  It is important to note that 88 cases have been processed to the price stage and price has been agreed in 88 cases.  These 88 cases cover 3,329 acres of land, approximately one-sixth of the total intake of land in a normal year.  That is considerable progress under the scheme in the first year of its existence. It came into operation on 1st May, 1974, and that is the amount of land that we have agreed to purchase for cash.  Therefore, we are making progress towards the substitution of cash for land bonds.  The retirement scheme is now moving smoothly and I believe that before this year is out we will have more than doubled the number of cases I have just mentioned and that we will have finally processed those.</P>
    <P>There is another point that I should like to deal with.  During the debate it was conceded by members of the Opposition, particularly Deputy Lalor and other Deputies who have experience of speculation in land by persons who are non-farmers and it was common case in the House that there could not be much sympathy for persons of this sort and that they were being well enough treated when being paid for the land in land bonds.  I have not the figures before me now but I drew the attention of the House to one individual who bought a farm in 1972, as an obvious speculation, and the Land Commission took over this farm and the price was fixed by the Appeal Tribunal this year.  The individual in question is reputed to have paid £77,000 for the land in question in 1972, in an area where there was congestion.  The Appeal Tribunal of the Land Commission fixed the price of that farm in 1974 or 1975 at £164,000.  The Land Commission have now to give him, in accordance with law, £164,000 and he will get £164,000 in 16 per cent land bonds and I do not think any of us need shed any tears for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>How much an acre is that?  How can the Land Commission allocate land if it is being bought at £500 or £600 an acre?  How is any <Col N="1279" /> person receiving land in future to be in a position to pay for it?  As I understand it, that means that a person has to pay about £80 or £90 an acre for land.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the Deputy knows, it was the case up to 1965 that all annuities were subsidised to the extent of 15 per cent. The 1965 Land Act removed the subsidy in all areas except in congested districts, against my wishes at the time, and since I came into power I restored the half annuities in Counties Longford, Monaghan and Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that fully. The Minister will agree that up to a year or two ago land was available for £10, £15, £20 and £30 an acre but now, with inflation, in Wexford good land is being sold at £500 and £600 an acre.  There is nobody who will ever be in a position to pay for it.  I am sorry to interrupt the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I can tell the Deputy that as of now there is still a big demand for land at the going price.  I do realise that it sounds a big price to pay but people are prepared to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> As I say, all Deputies conceded that it was not possible to get rid of land bonds overnight and as long as land bonds are in existence it is not right that Members of the House should belittle them more than they deserve to be belittled.  We are doing what we can to provide a worthwhile bond, to provide a bond that will hold its value.  For example, the present bond bears interest at the rate of 16 per cent and even since I spoke in the House on 19th March this bond has become more attractive because the interest rate has fallen marginally.  I believe this bond will hold its value.</P>
    <P>It was also alleged that bonds were irredeemable, that they bore no redemption date.  That is not correct. Every issue of land bonds provides within itself the date on which it must be redeemed.  For example, the 4½ per cent land bonds were redeemable in 66½ years.  The 12 per cent land bonds were redeemable in 32½ years. The present issue must be redeemed in 27 years.  It can be redeemed by lottery within that time, but the maximum period for redemption for the present issue is 27 years.</P>
    <P>In the past ten years a sum of £7 million in cash was provided to redeem outstanding bonds, and £2 million of that was provided since this Government took office.  The amount available for the redemption of land bonds last year was £1,013,682.  That was an increase of 25 per cent on the amount available in 1972 and double the amount available in 1965.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised a point on the last occasion which Deputy Browne has now raised, that is, that allotments might be refused because of high annuities.  As I have just pointed out to Deputy Browne, the facts show that the upward trend in refusals is insignificant.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want to spend an undue amount of time on my concluding remarks because I covered the ground fairly well on the last occasion.  I am making a determined effort to phase out land bonds as quickly as possible. I demonstrated conclusively to the House that we have made significant progress in this regard in the past two years.  Since this Government took office I have made more cash available for the purchase of land than the previous Government did in seven years.  Every reasonable Deputy will accept that it simply is not possible to move from land bonds into cash in one step, particularly in current circumstances. Deputy Carter and Deputy Callanan conceded that.</P>
      <P>A phasing out process is clearly the practical line of approach and, in adopting this, we must have regard to the size of the land structural problems which still have to be tackled and dealt with.  I should like to put on the record of the House that, at the time of the 1971 Census&mdash;and these are the latest figures available&mdash;some 91,000 farms were being worked on a full time basis which were regarded as not being structurally viable.  I am now speaking of family farms below the acceptable economic standard.  That figure would include owners in the older groups who might wish to retire, some younger people who would want to follow a career other than farming, and a number of elderly unprogressive farmers, many without successors, who might not wish to avail of the retirement scheme and who would not be considered by the Land Commission as deserving to be dealt with by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Making due allowance for all these categories, there are still 46,500 farms, approximately, requiring to be brought up to an economic standard.  There are 46,500 farmers at present who have not got sufficient land and the Land Commission are satisfied that they would make good use of more land if they got it.  It is the task of the Land Commission to deal with those <Col N="1282" /> 46,500 uneconomic but progressive farmers.  Faced with a task of that magnitude, the Land Commission must be able to make use of all financial resources available to acquire extra land to bring small holders up to an economic standard.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the retirement scheme and I think it will play a useful part but alone it will not be sufficient to deal with the land problem. I say that because the retirement scheme is confined to farms containing 45 adjusted acres which, in most parts of the country, could be up to 60 or 70 acres.  Except in very exceptional circumstances, the retirement scheme does not cater for the larger farmers.  It does not deal with the speculator.  It does not deal with large farms which are not being properly worked and which are not producing sufficient to warrant their being left with the owners.  It does not deal with the farmer who goes to England or America and intends to stay there for, perhaps, ten, 15 or 20 years until he thinks it is time for him to retire.</P>
    <P>We must still rely on the traditional machinery of the Land Commission to acquire such land by a compulsory process.  It has been agreed in the House that some of these cases would not warrant payment in cash provided by the Irish taxpayer at a time when cash is a scarce commodity, at a time when we must have strict regard to our priorities.  Therefore, we will have to continue for some time to come to rely on land bonds to deal with that sort of case.</P>
    <P>I hope that, year after year, in addition to the amount of money available under the retirement scheme, we will have a substantial amount of cash and a progressively greater amount of cash available to purchase land from farmers on a voluntary basis.  I concede that there are many cases in which hardship would be involved in payment in land bonds.  A man might want to sell one farm and buy another or he might want to sell to the Land Commission in order to settle some members of his family.  It would be desirable to have cash available in such cases and, as time passes, I hope we will have cash available to deal with that sort of situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> Members on the Opposition benches advocated the immediate abandonment of land bonds.  Without introducing an acrimonious note into the debate, now that quiet has been restored, I cannot help reminding the Members opposite that in their 16 years in office they did little or nothing to provide cash instead of bonds. Indeed, any steps they took were in the opposite direction altogether.  They extended the date on which land bonds might be redeemed from 1964 to 1984. They did away with the half annuities under the 1965 Land Act.  Members opposite who call on me to abolish land bonds now&mdash;of course, not all Members opposite made that request &mdash;are asking me deliberately to curtail the land acquisition programme, a programme on which the Land Commission will be engaged for quite some time.  If that programme were to be curtailed, quite a few of the 46,500 farmers now working uneconomic holdings would be left working those holdings.  I do not think this was really a serious suggestion on the part of Members opposite.</P>
    <P>I believe Deputy John Callanan's speech was the most common-sense speech made in the House.  He conceded that land bonds could not be abolished and cash substituted at the present time.  He went on to suggest a method of improving the present land bond system.  I know he does not have all the necessary expert advice at his disposal to process properly his proposal that land bonds should be compulsorily redeemed in five to seven years.  The effect of that proposal would be exactly what Deputy Browne complained about; if the redemption term were shortened from 27 years to five or seven years annuities would increase dramatically. That is the advice I have been given. I do not think Deputy Callanan had that in mind when he suggested land bonds should be compulsorily redeemed in five to seven years.</P>
    <P>As a result of my experience in the Land Commission, I know that, apart altogether from the 46,500 small farmers requiring more land, there is a grave land shortage and uneconomic holdings are still a major problem in <Col N="1284" /> most parts of the country.  Coming from a county of comparatively smallholders, like Monaghan, and having spent my professional life in another county of smallholders, Cavan, I thought I appreciated the extent of congestion.  I now concede that I knew very little about the serious problem involved until I visited and studied conditions in the west.  The genuine land hunger prevailing there has to be seen to be believed.  It will be solved eventually only by a mix of more land and off-farm employment.  So many people in the west are anxious to hold on to the land, even though they have not got sufficient land to give them a proper standard of living, that the only solution to the problem is the introduction of off-farm employment. My predecessor, Deputy Seán Flanagan, was of the same opinion.  If we were to down tools now, as some of the arguments put forward during the debate would suggest we should, we would be letting these small farmers in the west down; we would be abandoning them to the speculators.  I, for one, do not intend to do that.</P>
    <P>In the last few years some progress has been made in dividing up commonages. Where agreement cannot be reached the only solution is to buy out objectors.  Land bonds are essential for that purpose.  I would appeal to Opposition Members to adopt a reasonable attitude in regard to land bonds.  No useful purpose was served at the end of last year by telling the farmers their cattle would die for want of fodder.  That only resulted in a panic situation in which many sold their cattle at gross under value. As things turned out, there was more than enough fodder and those who retained their stock are now selling at very satisfactory prices. To adopt the same panic arguments against land bonds at this time would damage the efforts of the Land Commission to provide an adequate supply of land for the 46,500 farmers I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>On that note I commend the Bill to the House.  I should like to say to Deputy Browne who is present that the <Col N="1285" /> Bill is urgent.  The £40 million ceiling has been reached.  The last £1 million worth of land bonds has been created and we cannot create any more until this Bill has been passed by both Houses.  Therefore, I ask for the co-operation of the Opposition in this matter by giving me all Stages of the Bill this evening.  The passing of the Bill will enable a further issue of 16 per cent land bonds&mdash;the best bonds ever introduced with the shortest redemption period&mdash;to be created and will enable us to take possession of more land.  The land is available and, <Col N="1286" /> when taken over, will be distributed among some of the 46,500 farmers who are badly in need of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to obtain information on a number of matters and to put forward suggestions to the Government and, in particular, to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on EEC schemes. Under the most recent of these schemes aid will be given to disadvantaged areas, mainly the west, I regret that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is not present because I wish to obtain information from him on a number of matters.</P>
      <P>Are the Government, in keeping with the schemes under Directives 159 and 160, chipping in financially on the scheme I have mentioned?</P>
      <P>I am aware that under the other schemes, for example the retirement scheme for farmers and the farm modernisation scheme, the Government subvention added to the EEC grants amounts to 75 per cent.  In other words, the scheme in operation includes the EEC grants, plus a subvention from the Government of 75 per cent.  I should like to know in respect of the disadvantaged farm areas scheme whether any money will be forthcoming and added to the EEC grant in this case and if so what percentage of the moneys for the operation of the scheme will be added by the Government.  We are at a disadvantage in not knowing that.</P>
      <P>I would suggest a few improvements in the scheme as announced.  We know the delineation of the areas concerned but I do not know whether the Government are open to any negotiation as to whether it can be extended or not, but that is not the matter I want to follow up.  I am happy that the Minister did include all of County Donegal.  We appreciate this because we did make representations to him. Our understanding was that there was a proposal previously that Donegal should be split in two.  This has not taken place, but more importantly, now that the county and other disadvantaged areas in the west are included, I would suggest some things we would like to see improved.  I have this mainly from Press reports rather than from any information data we have got from the Government or the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> I would suggest a change in the livestock unit versus sheep numbers.  I understand that the proposal is that six sheep equal one livestock unit. Seeing that the scheme is meant to cover the particular areas which have been published and agreed, areas where sheep farming is of paramount importance, where large numbers of cattle cannot be reared and brought to full maturity, I think the sheep farmer should be helped and would suggest, not just to think of a number, that the number of sheep to equal one livestock unit be five instead of six.</P>
    <P>I have arrived at this figure, first of all, at the request of a farming organisation in Donegal and secondly, from the information I got that this is the case in the Highlands of Scotland and in Britain where this ratio exists.  I do not think our farmers should be in any more disadvantaged position than they are.  In the matter of grants, they are in a more disadvantaged position as farmers, I think &mdash;in regard to distances from ultimate consumption areas of their produce, which has not alone to find its way to the centres of population in this country but in the case of mutton and wool, has to find its way to the centres of population in Britain and the Continent&mdash;so it would be logical that our farmers would not be, in the operation of the scheme, in any worse position than their counterparts in Northern Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>The second point is the income limit of £2,100, up from £1,800.  I think this should be lowered and also that the ceiling for the livestock grants should be left open.  I must admit that I am not too clear on this suggestion.  It was given to me pretty quickly, but the suggestion is that there should be no ceiling, that it should be market value, and also that 40 per cent rather than 30 per cent should be given for fixed units like cattle fixtures and farm buildings fixtures for milk, cattle pens, and so on. These are fairly minor improvements I am suggesting in the scheme, but I would point out to the Government that by and large the farm modernisation scheme in operation since 1st February last year does not suit the <Col N="1290" /> small farmers of the regions laid out in the disadvantaged farm areas.  We on this side have tabled questions and a motion signed by all the rural Deputies to have improvements made in that scheme.  So far the Minister has not agreed with our suggestions and we have the situation where there are three categories of farmers, categories which are such that it is very difficult for the small farmers who are covered by the disadvantaged areas scheme ever to find themselves benefiting under the farm modernisation scheme.  This is a loss to the farmers.</P>
    <P>This scheme is subsidised to the tune of 75 per cent by the Government, to which is added the 25 per cent financial contribution by the EEC.  In respect of small farmers covered by the less-favoured areas scheme about to be put into operation by the Government, through grants from the EEC, I would make the case strongly that the same percentage rate of subsidisation be made by the Government.</P>
    <P>The small farmers of the west, who will not be in a position to reach the requisite farm acreage of a development farmer, who is the person who will receive first priority and the largest grants under the farm modernisation scheme, will be left sucking the hind tit.  They will not receive priority with regard to grants under the scheme and, secondly, even if they did receive some, they will not be of the same amount as those farmers who will be able to show, if they are transitional, that progressively they can, with aid, reach the development stage.  If they have already reached the development stage they will be assisted fairly substantially in grants under the farm modernisation scheme. Therefore, that is my worry and that of all Deputies from the west&mdash;especially those in the area delineated by the Government as being that in which the disadvantaged areas scheme will operate, given aid and assistance.  This should be an ideal scheme to take up the slack to benefit those farmers who cannot hope ever to reach development status.  For that reason I make a special plea to the Government that <Col N="1291" /> a fair percentage of money be added to the amount supplied from EEC funds.  It is a pity the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach could not say now what is the score here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  But it could shorten the debate very much for me and others who may follow me were the Parliamentary Secretary to say: &ldquo;All right, it is 50 per cent, or 75 per cent of the total grant&rdquo;.  In other words, that they would be adding a similar amount to that of the EEC or that they would be doubling it or trebling it, as in the case of the other two directives in regard to the farm retirement scheme and the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
      <P>Speaking about the farm retirement scheme, when spokesman for Lands, as I was when it was introduced, I welcomed it.  The Government were wise to go along, add not alone to the finance but not have it exactly as Brussels decided.  In other words, the Minister for Lands decided that the scheme, as envisaged by Brussels, was not one that suited Irish conditions, and decided to go one better. That is why I welcome the scheme. I did sound a warning that there was the danger it might be used to get too many people off small farms.  In this country, where we have a mixed farming economy, the small farmer is a must.  Provided we can enable the small farmer to have an off-farm income, there is nothing wrong with being a small farmer because economically it is good business.  The extreme advocated by Europeans is not one with which I would go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was speaking on the farm retirement scheme, when announced by the Minister and broadcast afterwards, I warned that farmers should not be pressurised.  It is a scheme which suits farmers who have reached the end of their farming career, who may not have anyone coming after them to take over.  It is an ideal <Col N="1292" /> scheme under which payment is made in respect of the land and a pension of£400 or £600 granted.  Because I had complaints from two separate counties that Land Commission officials were going around urging farmers to avail of the scheme, which is fair enough, and that those officials were accompanied in each case by an auctioneer.  During the debate I asked whether the Department of Lands had any recognised auctioneer appointed for the operation of that scheme.  The answer I received was &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The Minister, rightly, said he would deprecate very much any auctioneer taking a Land Commission official around by the hand.  I thought the practice would stop.</P>
    <P>I find now in the case of farmers who thought they were eligible under the scheme, who wrote to the Department of Lands for the necessary application form and data, completed such forms, or who went to their local councillor, schoolmaster or somebody else, an official from the Land Commission arrived with that person, accompanied by an auctioneer, who said: &ldquo;I can get this through more quickly for you and I can get a better price if you leave it to me&rdquo;. In a number of cases such applicants gave no instructions at all to the auctioneer.  Yet such an applicant received the auctioneer's bill for services rendered.  I understand the Land Commission will pay some auctioneers' bills and, worse still, the auctioneer phones, once he finds out the money has been paid to the solicitor acting for the vendor and says: &ldquo;hold on, do not pay all that; I have a share in it&rdquo;.  That practice is damnable and I would ask the Minister to have it investigated.  I know it is happening in Donegal.  I know it happens in other counties also because I have had letters to that effect.  Unless an applicant commissions an auctioneer to do the job for him, the Land Commission official should not arrive, out of the blue, with an auctioneer at that applicant's premises or dwelling and I hope that in that area from which I come and which I represent this practice will cease.  I have had many farmers with me recently who <Col N="1293" /> outlined the story as I have told it now and who have asked my advice whether they are liable for 5 per cent auctioneer's fees or not.  My advice to them is: &ldquo;If you are morally certain that you did not commission the auctioneer to do it, then you are not morally bound to pay&rdquo;.  I should like that to get across.  Unfortunately it is happening not in one or two but in a number of counties.  Finally, I should very much appreciate if we could get some of the information for which I have asked on the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>

      <P>It is a shame that more time is not given in this House to discussing the business of the European Parliament.  From now on, whether we like it or not, the Council of Ministers are the people who will decide our lives for us.  The whole system of the EEC should be changed and an agenda should be drawn up of what the Council of Ministers intend to discuss in the next six months, and one day should be set aside in this Parliament and in every other national parliament of the EEC to discuss that agenda.  It is very hard for a Minister who lives in one part of the country to have to decide what would be good for the whole of this island, small and all as it is, without being briefed by this Parliament.  Consultation after the decisions have been made is not consultation at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you want to know what is happening in Europe you must find out by way of question and answer across the floor of this House.  If you ask a question about a directive you are told&mdash; and rightly so because the rules are laid down&mdash;that it is a directive sent from Europe and it must be accepted. This is a most undemocratic way to run any community.  What I am asking is that our Minister in Brussels and our members of the European Parliament should be briefed on the wishes of our National Parliament in regard to matters to be discussed at EEC meetings.  As I say, one day should be set aside for such a discussion, and it should not be in an empty House.  I was appalled when I came here first to find that we had very little say.  Everything in connection <Col N="1294" /> with everyday life of the people, in agriculture and in industry is decided in Brussels.</P>
    <P>There are a few points which I would like to discuss, and I hope anything I say will be considered constructive. As I have said on various occasions, I would say the same thing no matter what Minister, my own or that of any other party, was in power. I do not use this House for political purposes, particularly when we are dealing with the lives of people and with the economy.</P>
    <P>When a number of directives came from the EEC some of us living down the country knew that these directives were unsuitable to our needs but we were criticised and told we were trying to throw a spanner into the works.  I will quote from a report in <i>The Irish Press</i> of yesterday, 8th April, which stated:</P>
    <P>An immediate review by the Government and the Irish Farmer's Association of the three directives concerning the structure of farming which is coming into operation was demanded last night by the IFA Secretary.</P>
    <P>We know these directives are completely unsuited to this country.  Deputy Cunningham went into fair detail about the disadvantaged areas.  I am not very clear on this latest directive, but I understand that Brussels will put 25 per cent into the scheme.  I think the Government can give a subvention of 50 per cent, and if the Government are really interested in the survival of these farmers, they will give the maximum amount which is allowable by the EEC.  I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is not here to enlighten us about this.</P>
    <P>Another thing I was very disappointed about is that the published location of the disadvantaged areas are very deceptive.  It is stated that the 12 western counties are in the disadvantaged areas.  I have a map in front of me of my own county of Galway, and there is very little east of the Corrib. Though we are in theoretically, practically we are not in at all, because the only advantage of being in is getting the headage payment.  There are designated areas, but desperately poor areas <Col N="1295" /> like east of Glenamaddy, Mountbellew and Newbridge are outside the scheme. There are only a couple of areas in at the northern end of the county, south of Lough Rea and the mountains between Clare and Galway.  It is ridiculous to publish that the 12 western counties are in when they will not get the full benefit of the scheme.  It may be said you are in if you are a developing farmer.  To be in a disadvantaged area is to be at a disadvantage.  In regard to County Galway I stated on one occasion that 8 per cent would qualify, but I am sorry to say that at the moment only between 3 and 4 per cent of the farmers will qualify as development farmers.  If it is not a disadvantaged area when that low number qualify, what is a disadvantaged area?  I do not know whether the Minister knows County Galway, but before he came in I referred to Ballygar and Newbridge as not being in.  He might be entitled to exclude the area around Eyrecourt and Ballinasloe, which is my own area but it is a shame not to include some other areas.</P>
    <P>I understood that those who were in the beef incentive scheme in the disadvantaged areas would be grouped with the present headage payment.  It might be a disadvantage to a farmer to be in the beef scheme at the moment but it is certainly an advantage to people to be classed in disadvantaged areas.  I object to finding it set out on a sheet of paper that we are theoretically in a disadvantaged area but practically we are not.</P>
    <P>When I criticised some of the directives I was told by some people that I was throwing a spanner in the works. I read a summary of a speech by the General Secretary of the IFA in yesterday's <i>Irish Press</i> asking the Government to seriously consider altering the three directives which came from Brussels.  The most important matter of all is if the EEC put in 25 per cent and we can go to 50 per cent.  Is the State prepared to put in the money that would bring it up to the maximum allowed within the context of the EEC?</P>
    <P>In relation to the areas within the areas that theoretically are supposed to be in the disadvantaged areas, who <Col N="1296" /> was consulted?  Was anybody at county level consulted?  In relation to my own county who decided on the areas?  I thought that at least the CAOs and the advisers would be asked for their opinions but apparently they were not. I resent the fact that all the 12 western counties are not in the disadvantaged areas scheme, although theoretically they are supposed to be in.  The fund is also too small.</P>
    <P>I do not like repeating myself but I have to in relation to Directive 159. I said this was unsuitable on various occasions.  I was told that there were very few people who would not qualify. I know of a man who has 100 acres of land, some of which is furze.  He has 30 cows and their calves, six young cattle, six calves, 40 ewes and he does not qualify.  If he was in dairying he would qualify with 20 cows.  That type of farmer is considdered a big farmer in my area.  There is something wrong when a man like that does not qualify.  This will have a demoralising effect on the people who will feel there is no future for them except social welfare.  If the Minister does not want to bring down the maximum income I suggest that an intermediate scheme should be introduced with a target such as in the small farm incentive scheme which we had.  Those farmers would be given a target to work to and told that if they reached that target they could eventually become developing farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised, when this matter comes under review again, that those people will not be cut out. Under the directive they are cut out at a certain time.  They are left at the bottom of the road and feel they will never make the grade.  Some of them no longer have initiative to go ahead.</P>
    <P>I know a few farmers in my area, who are in debt with the bank for large sums of money, who have up to 400 acres and can take advantage of some of the directives.  I thought those people would be classed as commercial farmers.  The Minister should try to get the people in Brussels to agree to having an intermediate scheme introduced for some of those farmers I have been speaking about.  I do not agree with the set up in Brussels because if I were Minister and went to <Col N="1297" /> Brussels I would not be able to talk for all the country without being briefed by somebody.  We never have an agenda from Brussels stating that within the next three months we will discuss Directive 159, 160 or any other directive.</P>
    <P>If we spent one day discussing one of those directives and briefing our Minister on the type of directive which would suit the country, then he could go to Brussels with full knowledge of what is best for the country and would know what he was talking about.  The Minister cannot have this knowledge without a full debate here on those directives.  On one occasion I asked the Minister if we could have a discussion on a particular directive but he told me we could not because this was something to be done by the Council of Ministers. Why should we not discuss the agenda here?  This would be the best day's work this Parliament ever did.  I again ask the Minister to have a look at that.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make is in connection with Directive 160 which of course is married to Directive 159.  While Directive 160 is a good scheme it is too selective.  Most of the people who are anxious to retire under Directive 160 are people who have land rented.  I know the Minister for Lands is anxious to change this.  I want to make it clear that we are knocking at an open door.  It should be changed.  It is ridiculous to retire a man who is working his land well at 55 years of age when a man who may be crippled and who is drawing disability benefit and who has to set his land cannot retire.  The person who should retire is the man who is not able to work his land or the widow who is unable to work her land.  The age limit operates in both those cases.  My view is that the age limit is wrong.  You will not get many men who are doing a good job on their farms to retire at 55 years of age.  How many people here over 65 years of age have made application to retire?  This State has to bear the burden of the retirement of those people.</P>
    <P>The process is that the person <Col N="1298" /> applies to retire; his application goes to the EEC section in Agriculture House and they process it to see if the applicant is suitable to come under the scheme.  That is the first step of the ladder.  A person can have his application rejected on the ground that he has set his land.  There is a case that I know of where a man set his land only a week before he applied for retirement.  Technically he was not entitled to come within the scheme.  I hope he will be allowed to qualify.  The next phase is that the application goes to the acquisition department and they have to consider the benefit that the land will be to the people in the area.  That is perfect. What I object to is not the scheme but the technicalities, the age limit, and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands said today that it was a great thing that farmers could retire at 55 years of age.  I am worried about one aspect.  Will this have the effect of putting people out of jobs?  I have known cases where men who retired early went back to work as cheap labour.  The farmer who retires at 55 years of age will go to work and put a labourer out of a job.  Many people will be glad to get men of 55 or 60 years of age to work for them.</P>
    <P>There may be a widow who wishes to retire.  If she is under the age limit she cannot come under the scheme. The scheme should be flexible.  Those persons we want to get out of the land and who themselves want to get out of the land and who are not suitable to work the land should be allowed to retire under the scheme. But for the technicalities, the scheme is a good one.</P>
    <P>I have covered the three directives fairly well.  I am very unhappy about the disadvantaged areas.  I would ask the Minister to give some indication as to the amount of State backing there is in regard to this scheme.</P>
    <P>Some attempt should be made to investigate consumption as well as production within the EEC.  People say that we are inefficient but I do not think they are all that efficient in the EEC.  What happened in regard to the pile-up of beef should not have occurred.  They decided that they <Col N="1299" /> needed so much beef to feed so many millions but they did not take into account the consumption rate of the different types of meat.  A particular slice of meat must eventually arrive on the consumer's plate and if the price goes beyond the capacity of the consumer to pay then you are in trouble.  There may be something to be said for a different approach to price within the EEC.  I know the Minister will not agree with me because he does not agree with direct payments at all but having regard to the cost of living it might be better policy to create a pool of money that would be used to subsidise prices when things are dear and when prices would fall to let prices find their own level.  This would be a better policy than maintaining artificial prices by putting thousands of pounds of meat into intervention.  It was a good thing last year but is it as good a policy as the one I have suggested?</P>
    <P>Every directive and policy decision of the EEC is very important but few people here seem to take any interest in the fact that we are now directed from Europe.  There is the Treaty of Rome.  I do not understand why everybody except this country is allowed to break all the rules.  I realise that the Minister is doing his best.  It is scandalous the way the French have discriminated against the Irish lamb trade.  We thought when we became a member of the EEC that we would have free access to the French market. Having regard to the levies imposed, that is not the case.  The Irish sheep farmers are in a very shaky position. I know the Minister is anxious for a sheep policy.  We were to have free trade within the Community and except in case of emergency no meat from countries outside the EEC would be allowed in while the Community was able to supply it.  This rule seems to be broken by everybody else but we have to be the good boys.</P>
    <P>If we are not bold here the Minister cannot be bold over there.  If I go to a meeting to represent some people if pressure is not put on me people say to me that I am making it up.  The Minister should go back to Brussels and say: &ldquo;I cannot go home <Col N="1300" /> to my farmers.  They are kicking up hell over this, that and the other.&rdquo;  You can create an impression at any meeting if you have the backing of your people. The Minister will have the backing of this House in saying what we want. He may not be able to get everything but he will have a better chance of getting something with our backing than on his own.</P>
    <P>It would be time well spent to debate in this House what is happening in the EEC.  We had a Control of Mergers Bill in this House.  Has anything been done about this within the context of the EEC?  I went out to an international conference a number of years ago and I thought that it was a big man's club.  That was long before we had any notion of entering the EEC.  If companies are allowed to get too big and to amalgamate we cannot control them from here.  We are only a fly in the ointment.  If they are not controlled by the Community, and if big money rackets and big combines get together, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers will become irrelevant because those big companies will run Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ask his colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs to see that we are not controlled by big companies who amalgamate and become bigger and say to the European Parliament: &ldquo;We have the money and you will do what we tell you.&rdquo;  We should spend a lot more time discussing what is happening in Europe and what is likely to happen in Europe.  The people who organise the Order Paper for the Dáil should see to it that we discuss what is happening in Europe more than once a year.  We should discuss it at least every two months if we are to keep in touch.</P>
    <P>Many of us knew that these directives were not suitable.  I think the Minister now agrees that they should be changed.  At last we have the secretary of a farming organisation saying they need to be changed.  We knew this but we were told we were throwing a spanner in the works.  I did not stand up here to throw a spanner in the works.  I stood up to give my views as a practical farmer.  I am looking at the situation from the point of view <Col N="1301" /> of the farmers and the workers.  We come up here and try to give our views constructively.  We should have a debate before decisions are taken and not after.  Debating something you cannot alter is a waste of public money and a waste of time.</P>
    <P>On the question of the disadvantaged areas, would the Minister tell us why we are in theoretically but not practically.  Galway is not by any means the worst of the counties.  If only 3 or 4 per cent will qualify for development, if that is not being disadvantaged I do not know what is. We should spend a lot more time discussing the European Parliament and what will happen to us in the future within the context of the EEC.</P>

If I had the decisions to make it would be very easy for me to select schemes and <Col N="1302" /> directives and tailor them to suit Ireland in particular, but there are eight other member states, most of them bigger than Ireland, and some of them with very much more disadvantaged areas than Ireland has. They all have to be pleased.  From the way Deputies still speak in this House, one would imagine we have only to say that something does not suit our conditions exactly and we would prefer to see this, this and this instead of what is there, to get it.</P>

      <P>The original proposal confined the disadvantaged areas scheme to an altitude of 1,800 meters.  We have no hill or mountain in this country which measures up to that.

      <P>We are asked who was consulted.  A lot of work has been done on this, as the Deputy knows, by An Foras Talúntais.  They did a number of surveys.  We have soil samples for the whole of the country as a result of their work.  We have income levels outside agriculture.  This scheme is based on comparable incomes. There has been a lot of criticism of the level of incomes.  We tried to get the lowest possible incomes.  We spent a long time trying but we did not succeed in getting incomes down to the levels we wanted.  At the same time, we do not want to get anybody's income down to a level which is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Nobody wants to keep any section of the community in drudgery for the rest of their existence.  We all know that before ever there was any question of any scheme they were leaving the areas we are talking about at the rate of 10,000 a year for the past ten or 12 years.  This is not something that is happening now.  It is not something happening now that is responsible for any discouragement.  I think, and I have said this before, that the more we criticise a situation that was never as good from the point of view of subsidisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The land project, as the Deputy knows, was brought in when the last Coalition Government were in power and, if he does not know that, he should.  I do not particularly want to go back to these things.  What I do want to do is impress on Members that we cannot tailor EEC schemes to suit Ireland, and Ireland alone.  As well as that, the Community support for these schemes is extremely small when one considers it as a percentage of the total.  The balance has to be found <Col N="1306" /> from the Irish Exchequer which means the Irish taxpayer.  I would be the last to pretend there was limitless money available for agriculture, or anything else, at the present time.  We should give up fooling ourselves that it is possible for us to design schemes representing pie in the sky and that there is no limit to what we can do. When one aggregates the quite small area in question and realises we are giving it an additional £6 million for this scheme alone in the current year one appreciates that that is a substantial contribution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham criticised the farm modernisation scheme.  He said it is not suitable; it is not suitable because we cannot bring more of the farming community in the west into the development category so that they would get the higher grants and he says the grants should be 40 per cent instead of 30 per cent.  I am sure we would all like to see them 60 per cent but there are a great many reasons why we cannot have 60 per cent or even 40 per cent.  The farmers in the disadvantaged areas can, of course, get an additional 10 per cent if they are development farmers.  Now I have to admit the number of development farmers in that area is quite small.</P>

It is something they never had before.  At a time when there is more money going into the west by way of grant and of one sort or another than ever before in the history of the west or, indeed, in the history of the country, Members should not discourage farmers by telling them they will never make it.  Deputy Callanan admits that if they get that idea into their heads they will go home, go to bed and will not get up any more.  They will give up working.</P>

There are other reasons why farming in the west is not the type of farming we should have there.

      <P>If the Deputy were a little more courteous, I might be able to explain what is the present position.  We are free to operate this scheme with a 25 per cent contribution from the Community.  There is another meeting to be held on the matter at the end of this month when there will be final determination.  It is my hope that we will get more than 25 per cent.  I estimate that the Community's contribution will be in the region of £4 million although nobody can give an accurate figure until the end of a year's operation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Callanan said there seems to be very little statistical data available in the EEC and that matters have gone wrong seriously.  I agree entirely that matters have gone wrong in respect of the estimations of beef consumption and supply but we are at a stage where no country nor no area can live in isolation and not be affected by what is happening throughout the world.  We have experienced a time of over-production of cattle not only in Europe but in all other countries, including Australia and the Argentine.  However, I must ask Deputy Callanan where we would be without the support of the EEC in the circumstances of the world slump that hit us recently?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>On numerous occasions I have made the case in Europe that there should be the most expert and best qualified market assessment <Col N="1310" /> groups in the Commission who would collect all the information and make it available to member states so that they would know what to expect.  So many factors can cause upsets in farming.  For instance, there can be drought in a large production area and very bad harvest weather in another area.  Also, there is the question of the purchases that may be made by big countries like Russia or Japan.  These are matters that cannot be foreseen.  Consequently, it is extremely difficult to have accurate and reliable forecasts.</P>
      <P>In relation to consumption, it is possible for the EEC to tell us of a rise or a fall of 2 or 3 per cent but as is the case with all other statistics we get, they are no longer of any use to us when they reach us.  They cannot anticipate accurately whether next year there will be a rise or a fall in consumption.  As Deputy Callanan knows, the cycle in beef production is a three-year one: when one becomes engaged in it he must remain in it for at least three or four years.  If the forecasts indicate a slump one must continue feeding his stock and losing money.  Where we were extremely fortunate was, that as a result of our membership of the EEC, we were able last year to take more than 500,000 cattle off the market and put them into intervention at reasonably satisfactory prices.  On the whole, I would say statisfactory prices if evened out among the people who deserved them, but that was not the case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and it is being misrepresented.  We have had much criticism of the whole intervention system but this country would have been in a serious plight last year had it not been for intervention.  It is my estimation that we will always be first into intervention for as long as the system remains.  I say this for a number of good reasons.  First, we are by far the largest exporters of beef in Europe, exporting, perhaps, approximately 100,000 tons more than any other member state.  We are not the largest producers, though.  Secondly, we export approximately 85 per cent of our total production.  Also, we are on the perimeter of Europe and are furthest from the markets.  For these reasons we shall always have to rely more than any other country on intervention.</P>
      <P>Recently I made certain moves in an effort to ensure, first, a continuance of intervention and, secondly, that the whole system will not be abused.  Deputies know that we have an enormous amount of beef in intervention yet.  Since the system was initiated we have put about 140,000 tons into intervention.  The present figure is about 70,000.  Apart from anything else, that represents an enormous amount of money&mdash;Irish money &mdash;but we do not wish to have that sort of money tied up.  Neither do we wish to reach a point later in the year where intervention stores will be full and there will be no place to put more beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that in mind I have appealed to the people in the processing business to appreciate the seriousness of the situation.  I have given them a couple of weeks' notice and have informed them that I am cutting intervention by 15 per cent.  Unfortunately, this is being represented as a reduction of 50 per cent.  Prior to sending out this notice we were taking 65 per cent into intervention but I have said that as and from a certain date two weeks ahead that will have to be reduced to 50 per cent.  That represents a 15 per cent reduction although it would be a 50 per cent <Col N="1312" /> reduction for anybody putting in 100 per cent.  Fortunately, they would be small in number.</P>
    <P>As a result of our membership of the EEC agriculture in the last two years received £108 million in direct grants, a sizeable amount of money. We should consider what the state of the industry would be if that injection of money did not come in the last two years.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of criticism that we had not free access to all the member states for sheep and sheep meat.  I have explained this on numberous occasions and I have answered questions frequently on this matter. I never ceased to press our case in Europe for the common organisation of a market for sheep.  I failed mainly because we are the only country in Europe interested.  The French really do not want it; they do not say that but it would be of no benefit to them. They are perfectly happy as they are because they can open and close the valve as they like.  If the market is oversupplied from their own producers, they close it down and do not take in any imports until the price rises.  That is doing us a lot of harm.</P>
    <P>However, as a result of the approaches I made in 1973, the market was not closed at all during that year. In 1974 it was closed for 13 weeks in total.  It did not close for 13 weeks continuously, it closed for a couple of weeks and then opened again.  This gives the opportunity, and the excuse, for people in the trade here to bring the price to the floor and say that as the French market is closed they cannot afford any more.  That goes on for a couple of weeks and when the market opens the performance is repeated. I have some doubt about the legality of this practice but we do not wish to pursue this to the European Court until we try every other avenue. It may be that we will have to go to the court as a last resort, if our view is not accepted.  There is something wrong if we as members of this club do not have access to every area in it.  It does not make sense.  We have the same trouble between two of the original member states about wine and a special meeting will be held on <Col N="1313" /> the 15th of this month about that product.</P>
    <P>There is no trouble about sheep with the original Six but there is no special interest because only France is producing sheep in any numbers. Holland produce a small number of sheep but they are not interested in exporting any.  We have been doing everything possible in relation to this. The UK want a common organisation for the market provided there is free access at all times for unlimited quantities of New Zealand lamb.  If they do not get that, they do not want any part of the common organisation. They are the forces we are up against. It is all right being critical but it is more difficult to change what is in existence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham asked if the scheme for disadvantaged areas was being married with the beef incentive scheme.  Yes, it is because we cannot have two or three schemes running side by side.  We are providing an extra £6 million under the disadvantaged area scheme and the areas concerned will be that much better off. Some areas will only receive the sheep headage grants, the mountainous areas outside the west.  Who decided the areas?  We delayed the implementation of the scheme for almost 12 months while we argued with officials in Brussels in an effort to get as many areas as possible included.  It was to our advantage to get the maximum area in.  I have asked if there is any possibility of a review for increasing the area and I have been told that there is always the possibility of review. Already we have had several approaches but they must meet the list of criteria set down for this directive if they are to qualify.  This is critically looked at.  No area is accepted simply because the Irish people think it should be included and we must accept that.</P>
    <P>We are not 100 per cent pleased with the various EEC schemes but there is no point in seeking a review before we have had the experience of operating them over a period of time. When we have operated them we can go back and make a convincing case that in the course of operating these <Col N="1314" /> schemes and trying to apply them we found a number of snags.  We can press for revision and for change but we cannot do that if EEC officials in Brussels can accuse us of criticising a scheme before we have had experience of operating it.  We cannot agree on a scheme now and change it every second month in the year.  I hope Deputies appreciate that it is far better to implement a scheme for a time and then make a case for revision and review.</P>
    <P>We are doing pretty well in the EEC.  Of course we would like to do better but, for God's sake, do not pretend to anyone or give the impression that there is any area that is not doing far better, support wise, than it has been doing at any time in our history.  Deputy Callanan should not be telling farmers stories that would put them to bed and encourage them to give up work.  The Deputy said that if farmers get any more discouraged they will give up work but he should tell them they will qualify because the more they work and the more effort they put into their work the more income they will receive.</P>

If they change the unfortunate system of farming they were advised to pursue over the years&mdash;unfortunately, they accepted that advice&mdash;and intensified their efforts and got away from the ranching system of farming they would be better off.

      <P>We come again to a discussion of some of the problems taking place within the EEC and as a rule, in such a debate, the main discussion is on what is happening to this country.  People put forward thoughts and ideas as to the way they think this should be developing, but let me say, at the outset, that as time goes by, one often wonders if one would see the EEC intact at all for another discussion, because reading the papers, following what happens in Brussels and reading about all the haggling and fighting and the late night sittings, one would often think that they were on the verge of breaking up.  Fortunately, they are not <Col N="1316" /> Again, one might be thinking was it all a bit of a show for the people at home.  The point about it is that we have a lot of discussion mainly concerning agriculture and the Minister is trying to tell us that things were never so good in agriculture.  I wish to God he would go down the country and see the marts, see the sucking calf opening his mouth at 10p a gallon and the majority being sold under £7 or £8.  If there is despondency, it is because people are failing to make a proper living out of their holdings and not being paid for their produce. There is no good in talking about this man or that man not working. If the income is good and if it pays to rear animals, or to have industry to produce goods, they are going to produce them but if it does not pay to produce them, the people are not going to do so.</P>
      <P>We have been in the EEC for quite some time and many of us have been very disappointed.  I fought very hard so that we should become a member State, but I personally think, and I make no apology for saying it, that this country is not fully playing its part at home by its policies, be they taxation policies or the way in which moneys are distributed within the various communities.  There is really nothing happening at all in many sectors and on top of that, England gets very lame all of a sudden and wants to rnegotiate her terms of accession. Everybody runs around saying &ldquo;Poor England, out on a limb, nearly down&rdquo;, and the whole world is over if England does not get what she wants and comes back in again as a fully-fledged member.  Is it not time someone stood up and told them the plain truth, that they should accept the terms of accession? Why did we not fight for some betterment of our conditions.  Why did we not fight to improve our conditions when England fought for renegotiation terms?  England made well on that deal and it could well be a sore day for us when the New Zeland farm produce will be coming in here, affecting our cheese and butter industry and our milk industry in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let there be no doubt about that. England is a cheap food country, <Col N="1317" /> highly industrialised, not depending on agricultural produce, not depending on selling their agricultural products on world markets.  We are the very opposite in this country.  England got special terms because the Labour Government were threatening to pull out of Europe and you would think that Kate and the child were lost if England went out of Europe.  I wonder would England completely survive if she did go out.  We have to bear that in mind.  Can Mr. Wilson, if the people in England decide not to stay in, come back again with another lame story and say: &ldquo;We must renegotiate further; we must have better terms&rdquo; and &ldquo;I must go to my own people&rdquo;?  That is quite on the cards.</P>
    <P>While that was going on, why were our people not calling for a betterment in our terms?  If there is a change for one, there should be a change for the other, bearing in mind that they are a cheap food country and going to import as cheaply as they can, highly industrialised, and that we are the very opposite, depending an awful lot for the survival of our economy on what we get from exporting agricultural products.  We accepted what happened there.  Our negotiators said they were quite pleased with the way things went, but previous to those negotiations, there was a mystery tour by the New Zealand Prime Minister and three or four members of his party.</P>
    <P>I had a question down yesterday as to what several members of the party were doing here after the Prime Minister had flown out.  These people flew out from Shannon some days later, having been accompanied there by Government Minister in State cars. We are not to find out that&mdash;that was in their private capacity&mdash;but it seems there has been some underhand work and that is why the Dáil question was put down, to find out what it was all about.  There seemed to be some underhand work going on before the member countries of the EEC discussed the application for better terms.  I want to make that quite plain.  I am saying what I am informed of&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary is looking at me&mdash;but this is the place to say it, and if it is true, it is his place to say it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the answer but we will leave it at that. The Parliamentary Secretary can answer if he likes.  The Minister tried to tell us that the farming community were never better off.  There have been no farm grants passed for payment, or paid, since we entered, no farm organisation grants.  He should have come out and told us that.  I am referring specifically to people who <Col N="1319" /> applied for grants since we entered. You are paying for grants which had already been processed before we entered, but since we entered how many grants have been paid to individual farmers throughout the country?  The reason this has taken place, as we all know, is that you have to be assessed as a particular type of farmer and there is a shortage of agricultural instructors to do this job.</P>
      <P>I would like to know what efforts have been made by our people abroad to get funds to pay or at least to get sufficient agricultural instructors to make out the farmers' requirements, his projects, the income he should attain within so many years.  It takes two and a half to three days to process a claim of one man alone.  There are not just enough of these people available and grants are not being paid and the State is being saved millions of pounds and blaming the EEC.  The State is taking advantage of that situation and has not provided the agricultural instructors to go out to do the job so that the farmers are paid their grants as should be their right.  They have not got them one way or another.</P>
      <P>Many speakers have referred to the farm retirement scheme and to desirable changes in it.  I would like to see people fighting hard for these because I think it could be a great scheme.  I would not like it to be thought I was critical of schemes in general.  It should make no difference what a man did with his farm last year or the year before; if he wants to retire and other people in the area qualify for land, his retirement should be accepted.  The land should be purchased from him and divided amongest other small holders.  But certain directives lay down that very strict conditions be observed, such as the fact that an applicant had to be actively farming for the preceding few years.  He could have been ill or anything else. Perhaps that is a change for which our Minister is fighting but I think he would need to fight harder still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criticism can be made also of the pig industry.  We are now producing <Col N="1320" /> fewer pigs.  We had less milk last year and there is less coming from our land.  The pig industry is in a bad way.  There are also very strict regulations governing that industry with which it is very difficult to comply here.  I should like to see the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and our people in Brussels, having conditions improved in order that we may survive in that respect.  I think the Minister said at one time that people would be better off to get out of pig production. Now there is a great scarcity of pigs which was bound to happen.  The Minister spoke about Deputy Callanan depressing people but when we were discussing the pig industry here about two years ago the Minister depressed people involved in pig production. Actually what he said was that they would be better off to get out of pig production altogether the way things were progressing.  Nobody will agree with me more than Deputy G. Collins in what I say in that respect.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the disadvantaged areas scheme which is a good one.  We are not at all criticising the principle of the scheme.  We are entitled to make suggestions and criticise what we see wrong about the scheme.  We feel that the areas defined in this country are much too narrow. They should be broadened and extended much more.  We met the Minister with regard to several areas in my county.  We had discussions with him on them.  Yet such areas have not been included.  In fact, there is included three-quarters of one small mountain range, with the remaining quarter excluded, which is completely wrong.  At least we feel that those disadvantaged areas should include those in respect of which previous Fianna Fáil Governments gave special grants for industry.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the IDA designated areas of the country to which they would give special grants in order to attract industrialists.  We should fight hard to have all of those areas included. That would be a very fair way of processing the matter.  What I object to is the fact that we failed completely to get information on the scheme before it was announced; one would not know where to go, to whom one should <Col N="1321" /> apply.  As far as I know committees of agriculture were not consulted; the general council of committees of agriculture was not consulted.  In respect of both the disadvantaged areas scheme and the regional one people are arriving from Brussels and hopping into cars.  Somebody knows they are arriving but the people directly acquainted with such areas and who could gain somewhat from such people's tour of the country know nothing about their arrival.  They do not know where they go or what is happening.</P>
    <P>While we were meeting the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in a deputation on the disadvantaged areas scheme in Dublin there was a gentleman from Brussels driving around our area but nobody seemed to know he had been there at all.  It transpired then that it was some city chamber of commerece that sent him here on a tour of rural areas.  We should have known he was coming.  Likewise, I would not think it right if such a person came, and met a man representing farming, organisations or rural workers' organisations who conducted him on a tour of the city.  How would it be viewed if a man from the midlands or from Munster brought somebody here from the EEC and showed him around Dublin?  It would, indeed, be very silly.  But it is equally silly that a man should arrive and meet city people who conduct him on a tour of rural areas. We would all be anxious to meet such people.  We are all anxious to fight our case.  Whatever the party to which we belong, the more money coming into the country and the stronger the case our Ministers make the better it is for us all.  But, as far as we in the rural areas are concerned, the various Departments will have to issue more information certainly in respect of my county and I shall not speak for any other.</P>
    <P>I understand now that the designated disadvantaged areas are those submitted by our representative to the EEC.  I want to know what areas did our people submit for inclusion.  What areas did the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries submit for inclusion?  No official in Brussels came along and <Col N="1322" /> said: you will include A and exclude B.  Our people were definitely involved in it.  But they all, including the Minister, refuse to tell us what was submitted for inclusion, which is something we are entitled to know.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about what he had achieved in respect of intervention prices for beef.  Indeed, were it not for the winter we have experienced it would be very difficult to sell beef at all.  The Minister made one good remark which was that he doubted if the money went to the right people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with Deputy Collins.  Is it not wrong, within the EEC or otherwise, to walk into a mart and see 12 cwt bullocks making £270 this week and then into the next ring and see calves four days' old&mdash;I shall not speak about the worst ones&mdash;making from £4 to £6?  Is there not something wrong in the operation of the scheme and what are we doing to remedy it?  We may fail to remedy it in Europe but one can travel the country and find people giving away calves.  I know a man who gave away two to a neighbour the other day to rear.  I know another man who shot them with a 22 rifle because he said he would not give them milk at 30p per gallon.  That is bad because there is an old saying &ldquo;Wilful waste makes woeful want&rdquo; and those animals will be valuable in time.  We should be trying to give some incentive to people to raise these animals.  Some of them were exported this year but there are thousands left and, if we care about them at all or the people producing them, we should give them some incentive to remain in the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of intervention payment will have to be changed.  How is it that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has set up now a commission to investigate the matter?  I welcome it but it is not before its time and I hope it will not be long before they issue their findings.  It was very difficult to qualify for intervention prices and get one's cattle into the various meat factories last winter.  The Minister <Col N="1323" /> should have intervened personally in that respect.  At the end of the season one could have come along with perhaps 30 lorryloads of cattle on different days.  Then one could go to a mart where there were too many cattle for sale, buy them at a depressed price, carry them right into the factories, sometimes making from £50 to £60 per animal.  That was very wrong.  If one wanted one could have sold the lorryload, and that did happen. That is what is depressing the trade, not the money that came in for intervention&mdash;which is a very good thing but the way in which it was distributed. I hope the Minister will exert pressure on the commission set up to issue their findings in the very near fature.</P>
    <P>Another matter of great importance to rural Ireland is the grants system for group water schemes.  As we face the mid-1970s it is only right that every house in the country should have running water and sewerage facilities.  But a big effort will be needed to ensure that that is implemented. As one travels around the country there are very few areas only where there is an adequate supply that can be tapped and extended from one town to another.  I wonder could we fight, within Europe, for a change if the local authorities take on very big schemes throughout the country. They are not undertaking many at present.  They undertake small schemes only attached to towns.  But I am talking of those running throughout the country, extending from one town to another, in respect of which special funds should be made available to local authorities.  I would describe them as very large group water schemes.  The local authority could get big grants for such schemes to carry water from town to town.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of unemployment. Sometimes world conditions are blamed: the Arabs are blamed.  However, we are messing up things a lot ourselves.  There are different prices for different commodities.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries spoke about directives from Europe and about the Treaty of Rome.  I want <Col N="1324" /> one question answered: How is butter a different price here than in England? Should it not be the same throughout Europe?  It is obvious that we could have subsidised it more in this country.  We were told the price of petrol had to be increased to bring it up to the same price as in England and Northern Ireland.  The week after there was a subsidy taken off the price of butter which makes it much dearer here.  Is the housewife who has to rear a family here not entitled to butter at the same price as her counterpart in England and Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>When we fight for something we are told: &ldquo;That cannot be done.  You do not satisfy all the conditions.  There is such-and-such a directive.&rdquo;  However, when it is to the Government's advantage, when they want to save money, there seems to be no directive, and they take as much as they can.</P>
    <P>We are going through tough times, but we have missed many industries here and unemployment should not be nearly as high as it is.  I blame our new tax system or the fear of the new taxes that are coming in. Every day in the newspapers you will read of somebody leaving the country. There was a report in yesterday's paper about one particular person. Who will you catch with those taxes? There are three categories of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me on that.  There is trouble in the car industry and in the clothing and footwear industries.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of the other speakers in trying to highlight some of the anomalies that exist in regard to EEC directives, particularly those that affect the farming community.  The previous speakers have dealt with many of them and for that reason I do not propose to go on at any great length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has asked us not to give the wrong impression about those directives, but if those directives are <Col N="1326" /> to be implemented as they are at present we shall be getting into the ranching system of farming very rapidly, because we shall be driving the small farmers out.  The number of small farmers who will benefit under any of those directives but particularly under Directive 159 is so small that it does not really matter.  In the county of Galway alone I believe that from only three to four per cent of the farmers will become development farmers under the scheme.  Before I go on to that, I want to say a few words on the latest directive, the disadvantaged areas scheme which was announced last week.  I should like to protest, like previous speakers, at the exclusion of certain areas in my own county of Galway from the terms of this scheme. It is little use telling those farmers who have been excluded from the scheme that they will benefit under other schemes as development farmers, because, as I said, the number who will qualify as development farmers is so small as to be negligible.  I want to protest, as I did when I saw the scheme announced in the daily newspapers, at the exclusion of certain areas in County Galway.  I believe that every parish, every farmer, in county Galway should be included in this scheme. The farms there are so small, the system of farming is so difficult, that it is necessary that any assistance that can be made available should be made available to those people in order to maintain them on the land and enable them to give their families a decent standard of living, as the people employed in non-farming activities can. These people are being seriously handicapped as a result of this announcement.</P>
    <P>In the brief circulated by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries the areas which are to be included in the scheme are defined.  They include the counties of Donegal, cavan, Monaghan, Longford, Galway, Mavo, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Clare, Kerry and part of west Cork.  Further down the areas that have been excluded are defined.  I wish to protest at the exclusion of those areas, which will not qualify for extra investment under the farm modernisation scheme because there will be so few of them <Col N="1327" /> who will become development farmers. The Minister has not given us very much information as to who prepared the scheme and who decided on which areas were to be included, but the first body that should have been consulted when the scheme was being discussed and when the areas were being defined was the committee of agriculture in each county. They would know exactly the areas that needed capital investment and the farmers that would need help under the scheme.  They would have been able to tell the people from Brussels or from the Department where this scheme should operate.  Apparently the county committees of agriculture or the CAOs have not been consulted about this.  It is very retrograde step not to consult the people directly involved. Those are the people who could give the answers to the Minister and the people in Brussels and should not have been ignored when this scheme was being launched.</P>
    <P>I now want to talk about some of the other anomalies which exist in Directive 159, one of which is the age limit which applies to those applying for grants.  Those aged 55 have their grants cut by 10 per cent. This militates against farmers in the west of Ireland.  There is a late marriage rate there and they are not getting their full share from this scheme. Many farmers in the west of Ireland continue working until late in life. Who would expect a farmer aged 55 years to retire?  If the marriage rate is low, such a man may not have a successor to take over.  How many people in business or in the professions are asked to retire at 55 years of age?  Most of them work until 65 years.  A special effort should be made to ensure that farmers up to 65 years at least qualify for the full grants under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Another grievance we hear from time to time is the amount of paper work involved for our farm instructors. Every application submitted for grants has to go to the farm modernisation scheme.  This has to be processed through the agricultural adviser who has to decide what class of farmer the man is, whether he is <Col N="1328" /> a transitional, a commercial or a developing farmer.  If this continues, the time of the agricultural advisers will be taken up with paper work instead of advising farmers how to get the best advantage out of their crops, how to manure their land and all the other advice they can give to them.  They are being forced to sort out the large amount of paper work involved in this scheme.  If this continues, we will have to request the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to appoint many more agricultural advisers.</P>
    <P>My county have requested that more advisers be appointed and if the present trend continues we will certainly need more in the near future or have clerical staff appointed to help them out.  We see under many of the directives that many of the industries which were of great help to small farmers are no longer of any use to them.  There is a high cost involved in developing small industries nowadays.  Let us take, for example, the pig industry.  Pigs were a very important source of income to small farmers in the west but under the present scheme unless the expenditure involved in the erection of piggeries is over £4,286 it will not be considered for grant purposes.  It is an impossibility for any small farmer to have that amount of capital available to go into pig production.  That only involves the erection of the piggeries. This scheme should be modified.  The Minister should do something about changing it because it is only big farmers who would have that amount of cash readily available.  Pig production should be encouraged among small farmers.</P>
    <P>The expense involved in poultry is so great that many people cannot afford to go into it.  There is no policy in the EEC in relation to poultry or in relation to sheep.  This is a great drawback to small farmers.  We are told that 50 per cent of a farmer's income must be from farming in order to qualify for the maximum grant.  We have people, who are not farmers, who are able to buy 50 or 60 head of cattle, fatten them and qualify for the high rate of grant <Col N="1329" /> because they are able to show in their accounts that the biggest proportion of their income is from farming.  The small farmer with a part-time job who, because his farm is so small, has to go out to work, cannot qualify for the high rate of grant because 50 per cent of his income is not from farming.</P>
    <P>Those schemes as they at present operate are designed mainly to abolish small farmers and encourage ranchers so it has the opposite effect to what the Minister said when he was finishing up his speech that we want to get away from the ranching system of farming.  If the Minister is not prepared to take up the cudgel for them and he and the Government are not prepared to see that the anomalies I have mentioned are abolished, to see that farmers in the west of Ireland are maintained on the land, then another Michael Davitt will have to rise up in the west of Ireland and the farmers will have to make their protest. They will have to ensure that these directives do not drive them from the land.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of Directive 159, if it is carried to its logical conclusion, where land is made available by the Land Commission or where it is available for division the small farmers will not qualify unless they are development farmers.  Therefore, you make the rich richer, the big farmer bigger and you exclude the small farmers. This is not justice.  If we are serious about maintaining our people on the land, then we must endeavour by all means, fair or foul, to ensure that these directives are changed.  Farmers come to me daily and tell me about farms that are to be divided, where the Land Commission have held farms for four or five years and are drawing up schemes at present to allocate them to different farmers.  Heretofore it was the farmer with the smallest valuation who qualified for land but under the terms of Directive 159 that farmer would no longer qualify for an addition of land.  It is the farmer a mile away from the farm, or two miles away, who has become a development farmer, who will qualify for the addition of land.  I do not know <Col N="1330" /> how it is expected that we can maintain people on the land if we allow this to continue.  I would ask the Minister and his Government to make every effort to ensure that the scheme is altered.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is talk of beef being imported again from third countries.  In 1973-74 this had drastic effects on our cattle and beef industry. In a period of one month, 1 million tons of beef were allowed to be imported from non-member countries, forcing member countries to mount a large-scale rescue operation through the intervention system.  If this is allowed again&mdash;and the non-member countries are pressing for it&mdash;we will have a similar situation.  This would be a terrible disaster.  We witnessed the hardships imposed on our people during that period.  Cattle were sold at the mart, particularly store cattle, for £5 and £6 per cwt.  This affected the small farmers in the west of Ireland more than anybody else because they are the producers of store cattle. The big man did not suffer because he got a fair price for his beef all the time and he was able to replace that beef at a scandalously low price.  It was the people who produced the store cattle who suffered.</P>
    <P>The intervention system might have been a good system in the short term but it was an expensive system.  It cost the Exchequer in the region of £8 million since it started in October, 1973, and the Government had to borrow this money in order to pay the initial cost.  I understand that they can recoup from the EEC 6 per cent or 7 per cent of the interest rate.  Nevertheless it cost the Exchequer a considerable amount and it cost the taxpayer a considerable amount.  I wonder whether some other solution could not have been found at that time.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions were made from this side of the House but they were ignored.  There was a market in Greece and Turkey for store cattle at that time.  The excuse that was given then was that boats were not available.  I wonder if that possibility had been explored, if the store cattle <Col N="1331" /> had been exported to Greece or Turkey or wherever there was a market for them and if the boats had been paid for, if it would have cost the Exchequer any more than the intervention system cost.  I do not think it would and in the long term perhaps it would have been a better scheme.</P>
    <P>The points I have made have been made by many other speakers but we must keep repeating them so that eventually somebody will listen to us. We are the voice of the small farmer in the west.  He is the man we are concerned about at present because he is in danger of being put out of existence unless the Government see fit to alter radically the terms of directives, particularly Directive 159.  That is the one that needs to be watched because that is the one that is of greatest danger to the people in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First I want to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that I welcome his appointment to the responsible position which he now has within the Department of Foreign Affairs, particularly with regard to EEC affairs.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary will do an excellent job because that is needed very badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people who voted us as a nation into the European Economic Community who now feel that they have been let down or that they were misled at the time they had to make a decision with regard to our entry into Europe.  Those of us who advocated that this country should become a member of the EEC did say that on gaining entry all would not be honey.  We did say that there would be many problems to be overcome. We felt then, as we now feel, that the right thing to do was to go into the EEC.  There is this feeling abroad that many people, if they had a second chance, might not at this stage take our advice, no matter how strongly we would give it to them or how we would try to influence them, as we did in the EEC referendum campaign.  There is an air of despondency which should not exist.  It is <Col N="1332" /> extremely unhealthy for us as a nation and for the EEC.</P>
    <P>Members of this Government have done more harm to the Irish position within the EEC since they came into office than many of the Labour members, including Deputy Keating, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and his colleagues, tried to do while the campaign for admission to the EEC was going on.  I do not accuse Deputy FitzGerald, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I am sorry I cannot say the same for his colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Every time the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries goes to Europe there are banner headlines in the newspapers saying &ldquo;Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries off to fight a great big battle in Europe&rdquo;.  One often has to read the article down to the last line to find out how big that fight really is and strip away the verbiage supplied by the well-oiled, well greased and well-monied public relations section of the Taoiseach's office, the propaganda machine in the hands of an assistant secretary of the civil service, who churns out day after day and hour after hour enough material to run 20 newspapers.  When one strips all this away and sees how big the battle is that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has on hands on that particular trip to Europe one realises what is really going on.</P>
    <P>We all wish the Minister success in all his battles in Europe but if he has some particular success at the time I am talking about it is a fantastic victory, in inverted commas, for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. The Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do that, if the Minister is not successful, he is interviewed at an airport on the Continent or here at home, and he lays the stick on the EEC as being the people who did not give him what he wanted.  Bluntly, any time he succeeds it is a fantastic win for Ireland, and any time he loses the EEC is blamed, and the seeds are sown in the minds of our people that we are not doing as well within the EEC as we should.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said by our colleagues <Col N="1333" /> from this House who are involved in the European Parliament that the feeling there is that our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is doing tremendous harm to the EEC because he blames them when things go against him and he praises himself when things go for him.  I would hope that the Parliamentary Secretary would feel, as I do, that this is an unhealthy state of affairs which cannot be allowed to continue.  The Parliamentary Secretary is fresh and new in his responsibilities with regard to European affairs and I would say to him that if he does his damnedest to see to it that this situation no longer continues he will be doing something worthwhile for the people.</P>

Perhaps I am touching the Parliamentary Secretary on a sore spot because he knows what I am saying is true.  If I am hurting him personally I am very sorry.  I do not mean anything by it but I will still say what I feel I should say.  He knows I have that right and I do not think he would interfere with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the votes this evening I had a late tea and I was not in the House when the Minister commenced his contribution.  When I saw his name appearing on the monitor I came in as quickly as I could.  Fair play to him, and I congratulate him once again on putting up a fair show.  He put on a brave face and he had the political neck to tell us that all is well in agriculture. As I came into the House the Minister, who could not bear to <Col N="1334" /> hear the truth from Deputy Callanan about the situation in the west of Ireland, was getting a little hot under the collar and was deliberately trying to taunt Deputy Callanan.  Let me say to the Parliamentary Secretary, who I know likes the west of Ireland particularly in holiday time, that things are not as well in the west of Ireland where Deputy Callanan comes from, or in the west of Ireland where I come from, as the Minister or some of his colleagues might think they are.</P>

      <P>When I came in the Minister was making a lame duck apology about his failure to do anything constructive or worthwhile in getting for us a common agricultural policy for sheep.  He told us that he has tried and tried and that he has failed because, as he said, other nations have not got the same interest in the introduction of a common agricultural policy for sheep as we have.  He did not tell us at what level or how strong his efforts were.  He should know by now, after two years negotiating with his ministerial colleagues from the other countries, that you can talk about things for a hell of a long time and get nothing.  We want to know how strongly he made our case for a common agricultural policy for sheep which we know would be of immense benefit to those involved in that sector of our industry.  This is what Deputy Callanan wants to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to know is our Minister going to the ministerial table with his cap in his hand, as we know he did in the earlier stages of his ministry, going like a schoolboy doing a man's job and naturally being sent home with his cap in his hand and his tail between his legs and still no common agricultural policy for sheep.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary who, in fairness to him, might have some interest in what is happening outside of Dublin <Col N="1335" /> and in particular what is happening outside the Pale might, with the aid of the many civil servants at his service, inquire into the nature and extent of the pressures exerted by our Minister to get this common agricultural policy for sheep.</P>
    <P>His apology here tonight was damning of his efforts and damning of his own contributions in the EEC.  He should go in there and say: &ldquo;I want this.  I am going to get it for my people because they need it and if I fail to get it I will know how to act when somebody else is looking for something else, when the bargaining is going on as we know it does.&rdquo; This will not be the first time we have failed at the bargaining table of Europe to get better concessions for our people and failed to get improvements in many of the schemes now in operation, improvements which we know are vitally necessary if our people are to gain anything worthwhile from those schemes.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that when the second last speaker for my party had made his contribution after the Minister there would have been somebody from the Fine Gael Party to make a contribution on their behalf.  I would have thought that when Deputy Hussey had spoken after Deputy Meaney somebody would have made a contribution from the Government benches.  If the lack of speakers from the Government benches is any evidence of their interest in the situation as it now is I hope the people, through the Press&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;will know how interested this Dublin based, city controlled Government are in the problems of rural Ireland.  It is no secret that farmers recently have suffered a massive drop in their incomes.  It is estimated that the average family farm income has dropped by over 20 per cent.  I must admit that those involved in milk production and in grain have not had things all that bad.  They had things reasonably good.  Despite what the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries <Col N="1336" /> said here tonight other sections of the agricultural industry, particularly the small cattle producers, are in a very bad way.  I understand the Minister did say that the money for beef did not go where it should have gone.  It was nice of him to admit that because we have been bellyaching about that for many months now and the records will show that.  Every time agriculture got a hearing here we told the Minister where the money was going.  We told him it was not going where it should be going and we asked him, as strongly as we could, to have a full-scale public inquiry into the situation.  This he refused to do.  At one stage, while not admitting what we said was true, he asked what could he do about it.  I retorted that he was the man who issued the licences for the factories and, if that did not give him a strong enough hand, then he was not a strong enough man to be in the job he was in.  I understand now a committee is set up to inquire into this.  I hope that committee will inquire deep enough.  I hope they will be allowed to inquire deep enough.  If they are not so allowed then the setting up of this committee will be nothing other than a whitewashing operation, an effort by the Government to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate in an effort to excuse themselves for their failure while the whole country knew what was going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister not so very long ago that a floor price should be introduced for the calf and store producer.  The Minister told us it was not possible to do this.  If the Minister and his Government put the same effort and energy that they used when trying to devise ways and means of taxing farmers into working out a system to provide a floor price, then something worthwhile would have resulted and helped these people who were in very serious trouble.  It is no secret that in this time of crisis in the farming industry farmers have had to use any cash at their disposal to buy food for their stock.  They also had to buy fertilisers.  Possibly because we suggested it, the Minister refused to introduce a subsidy for fertilisers to help those farmers who had no cash <Col N="1337" /> to fertilise their land so that food would be available for their stock. Providence was very kind to us this winter.  The winter was mild and soft up to some days ago.  The month of February was one of the pleasantest we have had for many years.  The sunshine in Galway during February turned that beautiful county into a Riveria while we were there enjoying the company of the fine people we met there.  Providence was kind to us in our weather and it was that weather that saved us from disaster. Had the weather in February been what it is like at the moment things would have been very bad indeed.  We cannot always depend on the weather to get us out of our difficulties and that is why we should do our utmost to ensure similar problems will not exist next year.  The Government's failure to help this particular section could still contribute to a disastrous situation in the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, the farm modernisation scheme in its present form militates against the small farmer.  On 28th January last on a motion urging the Government to introduce amendments to various schemes in operation under the EEC, I suggested certain things which would help the small farmer to benefit more from these schemes.  When the Minister was making his contribution to that debate he said the disadvantaged areas scheme would help the smaller farmers and raise them out of the classification of transitional or small farmers into the category of development farmers.  We all waited anxiously for the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I urged the Government in January to do something positive to ensure that this scheme would be introduced immediately because the people it would benefit could not afford to wait much longer.  I asked the Minister more than once to let Members know what areas were being considered for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he thought it improper to let the House know what areas were being considered but, as the record shows, he said that the submissions made by him to Brussels <Col N="1338" /> regarding the areas being considered for eligibility would be made known to the Members of the House.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware that the Ceann Comhairle had refused a question from Deputy Brendan Daly which was put down a week after the Minister's submission here but that when Deputy Daly went to the Ceann Comhairle, for the first time, at least during the term of office of the present occupant of that office, he changed his mind regarding a decision as to whether to allow a question.  That question was allowed only on the understanding by the Ceann Comhairle of what the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries had said the previous week.  However, the Minister refused to answer the question when he came to it.  He did not give us the information we sought.</P>
    <P>Regarding a question on another aspect of the areas that were being considered for that scheme the Minister said that proper and full consultation would take place with all interested bodies in the areas that were being considered for submission for participation in the scheme.</P>
    <P>At that time I asked the Minister if he would consult county committees of agriculture and the advisory staffs in the various counties.  Again, the Minister replied that full consultation would take place with all interested bodies.  We have had a recent announcement from the Minister regarding the disadvantaged areas scheme in which he informed us of the areas that were being included.  He did not have to spell out those that were being omitted.  Naturally, there is grave dissatisfaction among the people in those areas that are not being included in the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This dissatisfaction is genuine and if the Parliamentary Secretary bears with me he will understand why this is so.  All of County Limerick is not in the Golden Vale. As a member of the Government, the Parliamentary Secretary should know <Col N="1339" /> that a large portion of County Limerick is in an area where those engaged in farming are eligible, because of the poor conditions in which they are trying to farm, for social welfare benefits from the Government.  These people have been in this area down through the years and have been kept there by successive Governments with the aid of social welfare.  The Parliamentary Secretary will know that I am not talking of five, ten or 15 people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>He should know that on the 14th or 15th January last he answered a question on behalf of the Taoiseach giving me the number of farmers in the western part of Limerick who were recipients of unemployment benefit.  Perhaps, now, the Parliamentary Secretary will understand why there is disquiet and concern in this area.  It is one area that is not being submitted for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to belittle what the Deputy is saying but to point out that whatever boundaries are drawn the people who just miss out can be expected to be dissatisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, in your spare time, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you would try to help the Parliamentary Secretary understand the plight of farmers who are eligible for social welfare assistance.  The Parliamentary Secretary and I may often disagree but I respect his genuineness and have no wish to be unfair to him. However, I must point out that the social welfare assistance scheme is in operation in the western counties and that these counties have been included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Indeed, I must inform the Parliamentary Secretary that the only area where social welfare payments are being made to farmers but which has not been included in the disadvantaged areas scheme is that part of Limerick of which I am speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the only such area in the whole country that has been omitted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1340" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In this area there are 600 farming families who are dependent on social welfare to bolster their incomes from agriculture so as to enable them to stay on the land.  I say that without rancour and there are people here who can vouch for it but who do not belong to this party.</P>
      <P>Further, that part of County Limerick that has been omitted from this scheme deliberately is also an area which, like the 12 western counties, has a county development scheme and a full-time county development officer. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary understands what is required for the setting up of such a scheme and the placing of a county development officer on a full-time basis to service that team.</P>
      <P>Also, this area is, perhaps, the only one omitted which has always been entitled to the maximum grant from the IDA for the establishing of industry, particularly small industry.  It is the only area which has been omitted deliberately from this scheme which in the past has been allotted funds directly from the Department of Finance for the setting up of small factories and for the continuance of small industry.  I am not trying to make a claim for a new area.  I am merely pointing out that somewhere somebody for some reason which I hope was not political deliberately rejected this area despite the fact that it had everything going for it to warrant its inclusion in the scheme, perhaps even more so than the neighbouring counties of Clare and Kerry that have been included.</P>
      <P>This depressed area has been recognised by the present and past Governments up to now as one that needs special care and attention if we are to do as the scheme says, to encourage farmers to remain in these poor areas so as to ensure continuation of farming, the maintenance of a reasonable level of population and preservation of the countryside.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary's sense of fair play to inquire into this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries informed us that he would <Col N="1341" /> be having full consultations with everybody concerned with farming but did he consult anybody?  Last night in County Limerick the chief agricultural officer of that county stated publicly, for the second time, that neither he, nor his staff, were consulted with regard to the possibility of Limerick being included in the submissions in relation to this scheme.  I understand that an official from the Department called on the chief agricultural officer but there was no discussion of the case for or against any of the areas in the western part of Limerick, those areas not in the Golden Vale, being included in the scheme.  There was a vague discussion about the scheme in general.  If that is the extent of the consultation the Minister spoke of that Minister is overworked and is not in a position to live up to the undertaking he gave here that full consultation would take place.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister consulted with the farm organisations in Limerick?  Did the Minister consult with the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the IFA, Macra na Feirme or Macra na Tuaithe?  These bodies have stated that they were not consulted or asked for their views or submissions.  If this is the case there is something radically wrong.  We are being asked questions by the farming community in the areas concerned but we do not have the answers.  Those farmers are aware that the representatives for the constituency have asked questions in relation to this matter and have been refused information.  Farmers are sore at the Government, and the Minister, because they were kept out of this scheme.  How is it that a farmer whom the Government considers needs help in the form of social welfare is not recommended for inclusion in the scheme for disadvantaged areas?  It does not add up.  There is no reasonable answer to that question.</P>
    <P>It is of prime importance for all the small farmers, if they are to be kept on the land and given an opportunity of maintaining their holding, that they be included in this scheme. How can these farmers hope to be <Col N="1342" /> lifted out of the small farmer category, out of the transitional classification, and given a chance to get into the area where they could be considered for further help under the farm modernisation scheme if the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Government do nothing constructive to help them?  It appears that the words of the Taoiseach, the Parliamentary Secretary's Taoiseach and the leader of his party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one Taoiseach even though Fianna Fáil may not believe that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach when he was in Opposition said there was no future for any farmer unless he was a 100 cow-farmer and these words are now beginning to mean something to the small farmers.  That speech was ill-advised at the time and it is possible it was prepared by somebody who knew nothing about agriculture. I hope it was a mistake, that it will be regarded as such and dismissed. If the Government do nothing to help the small farmer by way of amending and improving the farm modernisation scheme as suggested by Members on this side of the House and by Government back-benchers and do nothing to have small farmers included in the scheme for disadvantaged areas, they are not sincere in their efforts to help the small farmer. It has been stated by the Government's well-oiled and well-greased propaganda machine that the aim is to encourage farmers to remain in these poor areas so as to ensure the continuation of farming, the mainenance of a reasonable level of population and the preservation of the countryside but that is not being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary doubts what I have said about the position in Limerick he should ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or the Minister for the Gaeltacht because they know that the pressure in Limerick is on.  Those who are being categorised as transitional farmers know that the only hope they have of being able to continue in farming depends on their being helped into the development category.  This can only come <Col N="1343" /> about if they qualify or are eligible for participation in the scheme for disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>While I have the ears of my Limerick colleagues, let it be on their political necks if it does happen.  I say that in the friendliest way to the people I am speaking to, because they too are nearer to the Government naturally, being members of the party supporting it and keeping it there.  I am using this opportunity here and now to urge them publicly, as I will from now on, to exert every effort, every pressure at their disposal to see to it that at least those 600 people whom the Government recognise as being badly off in a farming sense and give money to keep on the land, are given whatever help they need if they are to stay on the land and that a proper survey and full consultation take place with all and everybody, as the Minister said, who should be consulted and he said would be consulted.</P>
    <P>I hope that will be done at this late stage because the Minister spoke of &ldquo;the areas in Ireland which for the present...&rdquo;.  That is very weak.  I do not care how you look at &ldquo;the areas for the present&rdquo;.  Why was a thorough investigation not carried out into all the areas for all time which need help under this scheme?  Why must we act in a slipshod manner, as we did, in preparing our case for submission to the EEC?  Why did we not live up to our responsibilities and do the job as thoroughly as it should have been done, irrespective of what county it is in and see to it that those who are entitled to benefits under the scheme will be given their just rights?</P>
    <P>In the previous discussion on agriculture in this House at the end of January, contributions were made by members of this party here in Opposition in a fair and reasoned way, with nobody trying to score any political points whatever.  Suggestions were made which would improve the farm modernisation scheme and improve the situation as it is under that scheme.  Mould the scheme to suit the needs because you cannot mould a people to suit the details of a scheme. We have the opportunity to do it and <Col N="1344" /> again I say to the Parliamentary Secretary, new in his job of Foreign Affairs and EEC matters, that there is no point whatever as far as small farmers are concerned, in closing the stable door when the horse has gone. Mounting a rescue operation then on behalf of those affected is, to say the least of it, a waste of time and energy.</P>
    <P>I said not so long ago, and the Minister felt very sore about it, that I felt the Government were making quite a mess or a shambles of the implementation of the farm modernisation scheme.  I said it quite sincerely and I gave facts and figures to prove why I said it.  I say it again: the Government are not serious, for some reason or other I cannot put my finger on, in their efforts to see that this scheme be got under way so that those eligible for benefit under it will be given an opportunity to qualify for the benefits to which they are fully entitled.  We heard Deputy Hussey speak about undue delay in the processing of applications and this is so not only in Galway but in every county.  There is a great backup in the pipe because it takes not five minutes, half an hour, an hour or a day but two or three days to process one of these applications right through.  The answer, as I suggested here and in other places, is more staff and not just clerical staff.  The Minister in reply to my suggestion said he would give county committees of agriculture permission to get in clerical staff but he knows as well as I that we need more than clerical staff.</P>
    <P>He came in here and with his tongue in his cheek, tried to bluff us into believing there was no problem, no shortage of agricultural advisers and it is they who process the applications. He was quite sore because this matter was raised and, indeed, three or four weeks after my raising the matter a prominent agricultural journalist in a daily newspaper which was never known for its great devotion to the welfare of my party had an article in its supplement saying that they were reliably informed from a Department source that the Minister was beginning to crack the whip and was very annoyed with the chief agricultural advisers <Col N="1345" /> throughout the country at the way they were mishandling the implementation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Might I say that the farm modernisation scheme is a welcome scheme, a great scheme, a scheme that can benefit our people, if it is suitably amended in relation to their needs.  That is what I am trying to say and the farmers, and particularly the small farmer, the transitional farmer as he is now being called, knows this.  He knows that this scheme can do a power of good for him, if it is amended so that he can qualify.  They also know, and this is the killing part, that unless they are lifted out of the transitional category and brought into the development category, there are no plans or scheme for their future beyond April, 1977.  This is another reason why there is a certain amount of genuine dissatisfaction with the EEC, which is wrong.  The dissatisfaction should not be with the EEC.  It should genuinely be with the Government who are not taking the best advantage of our membership.  Those of us who worked hard day and night to convince the people that their place was in Europe want to see to it, and so far as we are concerned on this side it is the right place to be, that everything worthwhile will be done by the Government in this regard.  I shall have the same to say any time I feel our case is not being made strongly enough, as it has not been in regard to the EEC directives I mentioned, the farm modernisation scheme, the disadvantaged areas scheme and the farm retirement scheme, which badly needs to be amended if it is to be worthwhile and acceptable to our people.  I say to the Parliamentary Secretary, without trying to score any political kudos for myself or my party, or embarrass him politically in anyway that in his new responsibility in the Department of Foreign Affairs he could do nothing better than see to it that the case I <Col N="1346" /> have been making is examined closely. And if there is something worthwhile and constructive in my remarks, as I believe there is, I would urge him to do something about it.</P>
      <P>What the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries said about the farming community and how well off they are could not be further from the truth. I would say to the Minister that what Deputy Meaney said a short while ago about the price of calves is true. The Minister knows that one of the best calf fairs is held in my town every Monday morning.  I walk through it going to my office, as I did last Monday morning, and let me tell the Minister that things are not well.  If the Minister does not believe me, let him have his Fine Gael colleague, Deputy Jones, have a look for him next Monday morning and report back to him when he will know I am telling the truth.</P>

      <P>Question No. 5 I put down on today's Order Paper read as follows:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government the present position regarding the proposed Spiddal regional water scheme, County Galway.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied as follows:</P>
      <P>I received a request from Galway County Council on Monday the 7th instant, for a provisional order declaring that the proposal to extract water from Lough Boliska for the purposes of this scheme may come into force.  This is at present being examined.</P>
      <P>Following that reply I asked the Minister if he could give a guarantee that this matter would be dealt with immediately. I stated that I felt it was urgent.  The Minister replied to that as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This originally came into the Department in September, 1972. The Deputy can be assured that I have been pursuing this matter and that I ironed out a number of problems <Col N="1347" /> which it did not seem could be done.</P>
    <P>I found the terms of that reply most unsatisfactory as I believe the Minister's intention was to create the impression that this scheme had been lying in the Department of Local Government since September, 1972 and that it was only because of some action he took the scheme was now progressing.  Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.  The Minister should not try to create an illusion of activity and action on his part until such can be justified.  Enough said for the moment along those lines.</P>
    <P>What I am interested in is ensuring that the people of Spiddal, Furbo and the other areas to be served by this scheme get piped water into their homes as quickly as possible.  The scheme, as proposed by Galway County Council, will cover a very large area and serve approximately 600 houses.  I think that is the correct figure.  The Minister has not been involved in this yet though he wrongly claimed in the Dáil, I say, that he had.  I trust he will avail of this opportunity to clear up the matter when he is replying.  Be that as it may, the position since the 7th April, 1975 is that the council await the Minister's reply to their request dated 4th April, 1975. Perhaps I may quote a letter forwarded to me by the Secretary of Galway County Council dated 4th April, 1975 which reads as follows:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Re:Spiddal Regional Water Supply Scheme&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dear Deputy,</P>
    <P>I refer to your representations regarding the above and wish to inform you that I have today applied to the Minister for Local Government for a provisional order declaring that the proposal under the Water Supplies Act, 1942, made by Galway County Council on the 2nd July, 1974 may come into force.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Secretary.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he can earn the appreciation of the people to be served by the scheme through giving quick approval to Galway <Col N="1348" /> County Council's request as outlined in the letter dated 4th April I have just quoted.</P>
    <P>Let me give a brief history of the scheme.  On the 2nd July, 1974 Galway County Council made a proposal, under the Water Supplies Act, 1942, to extract water from Loch bPoll Uisce, Spiddal for a regional water scheme to serve approximately 600 houses.  A number of local landowners and persons interested in the Spiddal salmon fisheries raised objections to the terms of the order.  Galway County Council held a series of negotiations with the objectors until all but one objector had been satisfied, and he represented a fishery interest.  Finally, after further negotiations, the last objector, Mr. Buckley, sent the following letter to Galway County Council which they received on the 24th March, 1975, and which read as follows:</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Secretary,</P>
    <P Just="Center">Re: Spiddal Regional Water Supply Scheme proposed under the Water Supplies Act, 1942.</P>
    <P>I withdraw my objection to the above proposal on the condition that the Minister, in confirming the proposal of Galway County Council, substitutes the sentence commencing &ldquo;The maximum rate&rdquo; on line 6 of paragraph 2 of the notice received by me with the following: &ldquo;The maximum rate at which water will be extracted by the County Council while the top Sill level of the dam remains at 58.83 metres (193 feet O.D.) is 2,730 cubic metres (600,000 gallons per day when the scheme is fully developed ultimately).&rdquo;  The amendment to this sentence in the proposal, I am given to understand, has the full approval of Galway County Council.  In the event of the Minister not agreeing to this substitution, my objection will stand.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Herbert S. Buckley.</P>

      <P>I was going to say, Deputy, that it is a convention of the House that, if it can be <Col N="1349" /> avoided at all, the names of persons outside the House ought not be mentioned, or, indeed, mentioned in such a fashion as to be identifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so easily identifiable in this case that I think the convention was not really meant to be applicable in this case.</P>
      <P>That letter was sent to the county council and a copy was sent to me by Mr. Buckley whose name has been mentioned already anyway with an accompanying letter in which he stated:</P>
      <P>It appears that the County Council finally agreed with my wording of the proposal for the water supply scheme.  This is exactly what I asked them to do in August, 1974.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil this afternoon the Minister remarked and I quote:</P>
      <P>I ironed out a number of problems which it did not seem could be done.</P>
      <P>I submit that that remark of the Minister is not true and should be corrected by him.  The solution to the problem was proposed by Mr. Buckley and, had it been agreed by the officials of Galway County Council when it was made in August, 1974, it would have saved many months of unnecessary delay.  The Minister's final remark today about this scheme not being cleared up by me before now is seen to be a false allegation.  If the Minister has any decency in him, he will withdraw it gracefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme serves a Gaeltacht area and Roinn na Gaeltachta will be involved in financing the scheme with Galway County Council.  Coláiste Chonnacht, An Spidéal, takes large numbers of scoláirí gaeilge during the summer months.  The housewives who cater for these children are working under conditions of great hardship without piped water supply in their houses.  The Minister recently in a letter to a member of Spiddal Parish Council advised that pressure should be brought to bear on Galway County Council to expedite the scheme.  He said it was only number eight on a priority list.  I submit that this is not correct, that Galway County Council <Col N="1350" /> do not now operate a priority listing in this fashion.  The Minister should give the approval now requested so that Galway County Council will not be pressurised at anybody's behest in progressing with the scheme.</P>
    <P>I regret that I found it necessary to raise this matter which is related solely to an area within my own constituency, but it gives me an opportunity to highlight the necessity for urgency in dealing with the Spiddal scheme.  I hope the Minister can give some assurance to the people of Spiddal that this scheme will be dealt with expeditiously, because, obviously, the cause for delay in dealing with the order now before the Minister cannot be very grave and, I would suggest, could be dealt with in a very short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I think I should apologise to you, Sir, and to the staff of this House that apparently certain members of the Opposition have made it a practice to bring me back on the Adjournment, as declared by one of the Members some time ago, on the most foolish and ridiculous excuses, and this is further evidence of it.  Deputy Molloy today asked a question and got a full answer to it.  Let me quote the reply to which he referred, some of which he gave:</P>
      <P>This originally came into the Department in September, 1972.  The Deputy can be assured that I have been pursuing the matter and that I ironed out a number of problems which it did not seem could be done.  There will be no unnecessary delay.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that Deputy Molloy did not mention that particular sentence when he was giving the reasons for raising the question here, and, in fact he proceeded to say he wanted to raise it on the Adjournment.  I suggest that the reason he has given is a bogus one.  He just wanted to be, like a number of his colleagues, rather smart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of providing piped water in south Connemara was first considered in 1963, when a consultant engineer, was appointed by Galway <Col N="1351" /> County Council to carry out an exploratory survey.  His initial proposal to serve the area from a single source, Loch Corrib which was submitted to the Department in January, 1971, was rejected by the Department in September of that year and it was also contrary to an agreement, reached in discussions which took place in 1964 between the technical officers of the Department, the local authority and the consultant, that the area should be served from local sources.  That seemed to be a reasonable reason for rejecting it.</P>
    <P>Revised preliminary proposals for a scheme to serve the Spiddal area, including Spiddal village, using Lough Boliska as a source were received in the Department in September, 1972. A first stage of the proposal consisting of headworks, rising main, reservoir and certain trunk mains at an estimated cost of £245,000 was approved in principle on 1st December, 1972, by Deputy Molloy when he was Minister for Local Government.  Approval was given on the understanding that every effort would be made to promote the laying of the distribution system by groups, and the approval was also subject to the acquisition of the necessary water rights.  Therefore, as far as I am aware, it seemed to have lain there until a deputation from the area&mdash; not led by Deputy Molloy, but by the member of the council to which he referred a few minutes ago, and including the local clergyman and another gentleman&mdash;came to me and complained bitterly that nothing was being done by either Galway County Council or anybody else to have the scheme proceeded with.  On inquiry I found it was being held up in the main because agreement on the water rights could not be obtained, and that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries were very much involved. Nobody apparently had made any effort&mdash;certainly nobody at ministerial level&mdash;to have that cleared until then. I contacted the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries personally and my officials from that day until now have been continually pressing this issue.  The result was that the issues <Col N="1352" /> involved were cleared with the exception of the one issue of the water rights of Deputy Molloy's friend who has finally agreed now, on conditions, to withdraw his objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a debatable <Col N="1353" /> point, where parties and individuals come in.  The Department recognised that the acquisition of the water rights might be difficult, and the manager was advised informally in December, 1972, that he should consider meeting the owners and explaining the proposed scheme to them. This was done in Deputy Molloy's time.  Despite that, nothing was done. Most of the delay which was caused was due to the fact that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries were apparently not made aware of the urgency of it and, secondly, because Galway County Council did not, in my opinion, continue until they were approached by the officials of my Department, who insisted that the matter should be proceeded with. I am very glad the matter has reached the stage that it has.</P>
      <P>I want to take up Deputy Molloy on one of the statements he made a minute ago as to where the scheme occurs on the priority list.  He may not be aware that on 11th March, 1975, a report for the half year ended 31st December, 1974, was received in my Department giving Sanitary Services Programme, Part 1, and listing a number of schemes.  It starts with (1)  Ahascragh, estimated cost £68,000; (2)  Galway city, eastern environs, extension to Oranmore, £105,000; Reservoir at Briar Hill, £80,000; (3) Galway city, western environs, £562,000; (4)  Tuam augmentation, £40,000; (5)  Costello, £394,000; (6) Oughterard, £246,000; (7) Spiddal, the one we are talking about&mdash;I said number eight but it is number seven&mdash; £245,000.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Molloy is not aware that there is a priority list in the council of which he is a member and that they have submitted that priority scheme to the Department, perhaps he would ask the secretary of the Council to let him have a copy of it.  When I was a member of a county council I always insisted on being given information like this.  It is very useful to know.  One does not make a fool of oneself in the House by making statements which are not correct.</P>

      <P>A lot of things happened which Deputy Molloy was not aware of and I am trying to bring him up to date.  The next thing we come to is the question of whether or not this could be sanctioned.  Apparently Deputy Molloy was under the impression that all Galway County Council had to do was to send in word saying: &ldquo;This man, under certain conditions, is now prepared to withdraw and we approve of the conditions&rdquo; and that by return post we would give sanction.  He should know that there is a period of 21 days when this friend of Deputy Molloy's might decide he would withdraw his conditions or withdraw his agreement to conditions and might, in fact, insist on his objection going forward in which case there would still have to be an inquiry.  Because of that nothing can be done until at least the 28th of this month but that does not mean there will be a water supply in this <Col N="1355" /> area.  If Deputy Molloy wants to take the advice which I gave to the gentleman I wrote to at his request the place where the pressure has to be put on is in Galway County Council. If they want to notify the Department that it is now No. 1 on their list then we will attempt to expedite the matter and try to ensure that when everything else has been done we will be able to deal with the matter.  A lot has to be done because, according to Galway County Council, even if this was cleared now the target for completion of planning for this scheme is November, 1975 and the target date for construction is 1977. Apparently Deputy Molloy was under the impression that all he had to do was to put down a question here today, get the right answers which he wanted and then go back and do a Moses act, bring along his littel rod, touch the rock and everybody in Connemara had a water supply set up.</P>

Until the constituents of his who were interested and felt that nobody was doing anything about it at local level came to me the matter was not again raised by anybody at departmental level.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was a member of the county council from June. <Col N="1357" /> He was a Member of this House with the right of entry to the county council if he wanted but he did not do anything about it.  He thought it was now cleared and that he could claim responsibility for it.  The responsibility for having this matter brought so far rests with the local representatives from the area.  They included the local PP, who was interested in the scheme, without any political ties at all.  When he came to me I did not ask him what his politics were but I ensured that the matter would be pushed forward by my officials as rapidly as possible.  We are doing what we can but I do not want Deputy Molloy or anybody else to get the impression that simply signing this when the time comes, if there is no objection, will mean that at the end of this month there will be water in the Connemara area overnight, because <Col N="1358" /> it will still take considerable time.  The Deputy can be assured there will be no avoidable delay, as I told him today at Question Time, on the part of me, as Minister, or my officials because we are as anxious to see the water supply there as anybody else.</P>
