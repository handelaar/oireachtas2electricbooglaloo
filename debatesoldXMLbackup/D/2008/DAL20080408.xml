	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As I indicated to the House on 3 October last in response to similar questions, the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Nally report concerning the reorganisation of the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office was completed last year.  The last recommendation to be acted upon, that responsibility for the local State solicitors should be transferred from the Office of the Attorney General to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, with legislative provision to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to delegate to them, was implemented with effect from 15 May 2007.</P>
        <P>The management team within the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office keeps the organisation of the office under regular review to be able to respond to changes in caseload by redeploying staff from areas where demand for services is declining to emerging areas of work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>On 28 January this year, the Director of Public Prosecutions published on his website a document known as the Reasons Project.  It was a discussion paper on prosecution policy and the provision of reasons for decisions.  As the House is aware, the DPP&rsquo;s role is to conduct all criminal prosecutions which are serious enough to be tried before a jury.  The problem is that in cases where no prosecution is taken, no reason for this is given.  The <Col N="272"/>question is whether it is appropriate for some reason to be given in cases where a prosecution does not take place.  The question posed by the Reasons Project was whether the DPP should give reasons for decisions to prosecute or otherwise.  In 1983, the then Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Eamonn Barnes, said he would willingly put into operation a method that would allow him to inform the public of the reasons for his decisions without doing injustice, if it were possible to devise such a method.  </P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is aware that countries with legal systems similar to Ireland&rsquo;s have confronted this problem and have changed practices.  The Taoiseach is also aware of increasing recognition that it is desirable to inform victims of the reasons behind decisions that can profoundly affect their lives.  This is a sensitive area and complex legal issues are involved.</P>
        <P>Has the Government responded to the Reasons Project paper published by the Director of Public Prosecutions?  Has the Government a view on changing the current practice whereby reasons not to prosecute are not given?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Kenny stated, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions initiated this paper on 28 January to examine the current policy of not giving reasons to victims or the public for decisions not to prosecute.  Deputy Kenny will recall, as I do, many occasions on which we heard debate relating to cases in which families felt aggrieved by this situation.  On a number of occasions in recent years the Director of Public Prosecutions has acknowledged that a difficulty exists in this area, particularly when it comes to sensitive issues relating to families that feel they have been left in a vacuum by a decision.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The director invited submissions from all interested parties, including members of the public, and opinions were sought on the following questions.  Should the current policy be changed?  If so, should reasons be given only to those with a direct interest, such as the victims of crime or their relations?  I have previously expressed sympathy for relations in these circumstances, though I can see the difficulty behind giving reasons to everyone.  Should reasons be given to the public?  If reasons are given, should they be general or detailed?  Should reasons be given in all cases or only in certain categories of cases?  If reasons should only be given in certain categories of cases, then which categories?  How can reasons be given without encroaching on the constitutional right to one&rsquo;s good name and the presumption of innocence?  This point was made often when this issue arose over the years.  Should the communication of reasons attract legal privilege?  Dealing with such a question could be a very complex matter.  How should cases where a reason cannot be given without causing injustice be dealt with?  By whom and what means should reasons be communicated?</P>
        <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions used his experience to set out where difficulties may arise in these areas and sought submissions by 10 March.  His office will now carefully consider the submissions received and formulate a view on how best to proceed.  The Government has communicated often on this issue over the years and those communications will be taken into account.</P>
        <P>Attorneys General and Government Ministers have given views on this matter but, based on my experience, I feel difficulties will arise regarding the second question I mentioned: should reasons be given only to those with a direct interest, such as the victims of crime or their relations?  This is a question with which I have been confronted and it is the one that tends to cause the most concern.  Some would say that some or all of the questions will raise difficulties but I feel this question is most difficult.  Ultimately, the victims of crime and their direct relatives are the people who suffer; everyone else can move on.  In many high-level cases, victims of crime are deceased and their relations are left in a vacuum and I would like to see such cases addressed.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="273"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view in that regard.  Prior to the election last year I was shocked by the scale of hurt felt by a woman who was abused in her childhood years.  Eventually when the case was sent before the Director of Public Prosecutions she was informed, not by the DPP but by the abuser, that a prosecution was not being taken, which, as the Taoiseach rightly says, is appalling.  If the Taoiseach is minded to change this practice, as I would be, is there a view that communications should attract legal privilege when they are given?  Has consideration been given to the question of how to deal with cases where a reason cannot be given without an injustice being undermined?  Those are two issues that require some consideration if the practice is to be changed.</P>
        <P>I will move to a separate question if I may.  Yesterday the civil case began in the case of the Omagh bomb and the victims thereof.  It seems as if this is the only recourse to justice and truth the family members of those who were murdered in that horrible atrocity will get.  The Taoiseach is aware that the Supreme Court determined that the transcripts of the trials held here should be handed over as evidence or back-up information in respect of this case.  He is aware also that the civil actions are for in the order of &euro;14 million against a number of members.  In respect of this jurisdiction, can I take it that the resources of the State and whatever evidence is available to it in terms of the Garda, these transcripts and other documentation that may be available will be provided to the victims of the Omagh bomb in respect of their taking this civil case?  Is the Taoiseach happy that that will be so and will he commit himself to ensure it will happen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are stretching it a bit, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first question, we all await the deliberations of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is good that he is taking this initiative.  The submissions are now in and we just have to await the process and what will be decided.  Obviously there are large legal issues around these questions, the issue of privilege and others, but at least we are into a process, the outcome of which we await.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I was asked a large number of questions by the Omagh families, including Mr. Gallagher, who have fought a very intense case on this issue for a number of years.  I have asked all the different arms of the State to co-operate with them.  I confess there is reluctance in some areas because of all kinds of complexities and legal issues as to how things can be given, but I do not propose to go into all of those.  I have asked everyone to co-operate as fully as possible to assist them.  We know they are not totally happy in regard to those issues, but at least I have tried, as best I can, to give them all the information and to explain the process to get into if we cannot give them the information directly.  Obviously this is very important for them because it is very difficult, ten years on from Omagh, for the families to get a process whereby somebody can be brought to justice and, in many cases, even if people are not brought to justice, that they can see that the matter is fully dealt with.  I have answered their correspondence and I have asked people across the system, in so far as they can, to explain to them the process through which they can the maximum information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach made commendable efforts in respect of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings to bring some finality and closure to that issue, which had gone on for a very long time.  As he rightly pointed out, the Omagh bombing took place ten years ago.  I commend the Taoiseach&rsquo;s action in making available whatever he can to these victims.  I met with Michael Gallagher, as the Taoiseach did, and those people and that pain and hurt will be with them for the rest of their lives.  It is very important, in so far as justice and truth can be followed through, that the action the Taoiseach has instructed takes place.  I commend the Taoiseach in that regard.</P>

	<P>On the last occasion the Taoiseach answered questions on the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, he indicated that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions would carry out an assessment of additional staff necessary to pursue prosecutions for breaches of fisheries regulations.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if this review has been carried out, if additional staff have been recruited to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and if he is aware of the great anger and resentment in fishing communities that the Government chose a criminal analysis of breaches rather than an administrative range of penalties?  There is a strong sense that fishing communities have been criminalised and that this is both inappropriate and not representative of all states&rsquo; actions in this regard.  What is the current situation and what steps have been taken to address staff needs?  Is it in that particular vein that new recruitment has taken place and does the Taoiseach have any intention of revisiting the legislation in respect of breaches of the fishing regulations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first question, last year the Minister for Finance approved 28 new permanent posts and one contract post for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to take account of the increase in the volume and complexity of work undertaken by the office, as referred to during Question Time that day, and the fact that new areas of work have emerged, which must be addressed.  The staff have been employed, bringing the total authorised staff complement of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to 204.  Filling of additional posts was sanctioned last year.  The process was slow initially due to difficulties in securing accommodation for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but I understand the office has continued to recruit staff, notwithstanding accommodation difficulties.  The office currently has eight staff vacancies and five solicitors in the process of appointment.  Practically all of them are there, bringing it up to the full complement.</P>
        <P>In addition to the new staff sanctioned last year, the director is in communication with the Courts Service and the Departments of Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform with regard to further staff required to implement a range of initiatives under the Criminal Justice Act.  These had not arisen at that time and represent additional work.  I understand the number of additional staff has not been considered in the consultation between the two Departments and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but the additional workload has been identified.</P>
        <P>The director is examining the extra staff that will be required to have responsibility with regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s second question.  Responsibility for sea fisheries protection has been transferred to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions from the Attorney General.  As part of that, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has a team in her Department examining the issue of administrative sanctions under fisheries legislation.  With the necessary legal advice the Minister will come to a decision on that in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>From the Taoiseach&rsquo;s latter response, do I take it that there is currently a review of sanctions for breaches of fisheries regulations and that the Minister is examining the alternative of administrative sanctions as against criminal sanctions?  Can the Taoiseach be specific and clear in that regard?  This is a serious matter.  A whole section of society dependent on the fishing industry believes it has been criminalised, which is the sanction it will face if in breach.</P>
        <P>Concerning recruitment, the Taoiseach has indicated vacancies, but have new positions been created?  The Taoiseach referred to eight vacancies and five solicitors in the process of being appointed, but have new positions been created in either the Office of the Chief State Solicitor or the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  If so, why is there a recruitment embargo <Col N="275"/>in some areas under broad public service-Civil Service responsibilities but not in these particular cases?  I refer specifically to the Health Service Executive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The staff levels continue to increase in most of these areas.  In recent years, the HSE has received thousands of additional staff.  We are not talking here about a small number.  There were 28 new permanent posts approved.</P>
        <P>On the fisheries issue, I understand that there is no alteration of or change in the present legislation, but there is an internal examination by the Minister of the administrative sanctions.  Obviously, it takes into account the views of the stakeholders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Last August when the DPP published his annual report, he stated that his office was struggling to provide advice to the Government on major legal issues, including proposed legislation, due to staff shortages.  He raised the necessity of a fully resourced prosecution policy unit to cope with the increase in prosecution work that would be required.</P>
        <P>Will the filling of the vacancies described in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and the vacancies under discussion between the DPP and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance be sufficient to meet the full staffing requirement of the DPP&rsquo;s office?  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that prosecutions will not be delayed as a result of staff shortages in the DPP&rsquo;s office?</P>
        <P>When these questions were answered by the Taoiseach earlier this year, he told the House that there were 14.5 vacancies in the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.  Have they been filled?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be loath to say to Deputy Gilmore that we will ever reach a position where there are no more demands for staff in this area.  It seems to be almost endless every year.  With the exception of the range of initiatives in the criminal justice sector that are being considered, all of the other demands have been met, but there is a request for a number of additional staff &mdash; it is not yet clear what number &mdash; to deal with changes we have made in the House to the criminal justice sector.  We are now up to a complement &mdash; there has been a very large increase over the past four or five years &mdash; of 204.</P>
        <P>The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office has recruited additional staff that were also approved last year.  Currently, it has a staff complement of 249 full-time equivalents.  A number of vacancies exist in the office and it is in the process of filling them in the normal way.  I understand that there are 17 vacancies at present covering posts at solicitor, legal executive, administrative and clerical levels.  The office is working with the Public Appointments Service and the Department of Finance regarding the options available for recruiting these staff, but this movement and turnover is not unusual.  Many people go into those offices to gain experience for a number of years and move on, so there is a lot of career movement in the area.  The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office complement is 249 and the DPP&rsquo;s is 204, which are very sizable increases above where we were just four or five years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Taoiseach received reports, either directly from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that prosecutions are being delayed as a result of staff shortages in the former?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>While there are always some problems, as I understand it, this issue has not been highlighted to me in the recent past.  This was a constant issue before completion of the reforms four or five years ago.  However, the issue has not been brought to my attention in recent times.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="276"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>While considering the reorganisation of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, will the Taoiseach consider establishing a practice whereby all Departments involved in legal actions should report to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office the details of such actions?  I raise this matter because a Supplementary Estimate for more than &pound;3 million was considered recently at a finance committee.  When inquiries were made, half of the sum, &pound;1.5 million, was in respect of legal costs.  The report stated that on the advice of senior counsel, it was now recommended that the Department should settle for the sum of &pound;3 million.  This matter dragged on for years, to the point at which, if memory serves, costs had accumulated to &pound;1.5 million, although the matter should have been settled immediately.  At the end of the aforementioned period, a senior counsel advised the Department in question to settle this action.  Had the matter been tracked properly, the taxpayers could have been saved more than &pound;3 million &mdash; I refer to pounds, not euro.</P>
        <P>The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office should be a centre to which all such outstanding claims in various Departments are reported and where a decision should be taken as to whether claims should be settled, instead of being dragged out as the file is moved from one person&rsquo;s desk to another.  People retire, the matter continues and someone else comes in.  The Ceann Comhairle is familiar with this practice.  While examining the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office, the Taoiseach should put in place some measure that would save the taxpayer considerable moneys.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I take Deputy Barrett&rsquo;s point.  Approximately three or four years ago, the then Attorney General started a mandatory process entailing the notification on a regular basis of any significant case within any Department or being processed by any Department of the Office of the Attorney General so that office can track it.  I do not know what is the benchmark figure.  This pertains not to every case but to every significant case.  I understand there is an obligation to report such cases to the Attorney General a few times a year.  Such a process was not in place and the then Attorney General started it, maybe not as a result of the case to which Deputy Barrett referred, but similar cases of which the Attorney General&rsquo;s office was not aware.  However, that process is now in place and the only aspect about which I am unsure is the benchmark figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is that the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is more in keeping with each individual case up to the point at which senior counsel opinion is sought.  That office is involved from the outset.  I respectfully suggest the Taoiseach should investigate the possibility of having such cases recorded in the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office rather than in the Office of the Attorney General.  While the offices can communicate with each other, small cases become big cases because solicitors write to other solicitors.  It is only at a certain point that a senior counsel&rsquo;s opinion is brought into action.  The Taoiseach will find this is happening in local authorities throughout the State and God only knows how much money is being spent by local authorities in dragging out cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty with that and I will bring to the attention of the Attorney General the issue of where this links in with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.  Deputy Barrett is correct, as litigation into this, that and the other is the order of the day and due to the volume of cases, tracking is a more difficult issue.  I am unsure where that kicks in with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office, perhaps it does, but I will bring that point to the attention of the Attorney General.</P>

        <Quest> the progress made to date by the quality cus<Col N="277"/>tomer service working group established within his Department under the strategic management initiative; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The development, promotion and implementation of the quality customer service, QCS, initiative has been driven in recent years mainly by two groups, the QCS officers&rsquo; network and the QCS research group, both of which meet four or five times each year.  The QCS officers&rsquo; network continues to work intensively on the development and implementation of a range of customer service issues, including promotion of the customer charter approach.  This is an important initiative whereby public service organisations publicly commit to service standards and then measure and report on progress made.</P>
        <P>Arising from the recent review of customer charters, revised guidelines for the preparation of charters and customer action plans have been produced and will be published shortly.  The QCS research group has recently been involved in the development of a major survey of customer satisfaction levels and attitudes towards the Civil Service.  Such surveys will now be conducted on an annual basis beginning with a survey of general public customers to commence in the coming weeks.  A similar survey of business customers will be undertaken later this year.</P>
        <P>A new task force on customer service has also been established to consider and bring forward proposals on how best to enhance and deepen the quality of customer service in key front line areas of the Civil Service and wider public service, as well as to consider the various commitments to customer service made in the programme for Government.  This task force, which is made up of senior officials from Departments, offices and agencies, is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The task force has met four times since it was set up last September and will submit its final report in early 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the years, we have often raised the question of the efficiency of the public service from the perspective of customer convenience.  Out of 100 public offices surveyed by Deputy Varadkar, only three were open on Saturdays, three were open after 6 p.m. and a large number were found not to meet normal office opening hours.  For example, the public planning counters in the four Dublin local authorities close by 4.30 p.m. and in Fingal and Meath county councils they close at 3.30 p.m.</P>
        <P>From that perspective and taking into account the e-government project, in respect of which no formal strategy appears to have been devised, what practical plans or proposals have been made to improve efficiency and convenience for customers under the strategic management initiative for which the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department has overall authority?  Given the busy schedules and working lives of the vast majority of people, does the Taoiseach agree that all modern technologies should be made available to them so they can conduct their business with the State more conveniently and professionally?  Does he have other proposals in mind based on the e-government concept and, if so, when will these be rolled out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to accessibility, both in terms of hours and physical accessibility, the Office of Public Works has been working on that issue for the past 15 years.  The OPW is responsible for physical access to 2,000 properties and it has campaigned actively on making them more accessible.  This took up a lot of its efforts and resources over many years.  That programme is fairly complete except for some very difficult offices.</P>
        <P>A large number of public offices are opening longer, particularly during lunchtimes.  I pressed hard on this over the years and, whatever about evenings or mornings, I do not think there is an argument in respect of lunchtime.  It is easy to organise access to offices at lunchtime by leaving a staff member on duty.</P><Col N="278"/>
        <P>The increasing use of information technology has meant that information and, in some cases, transactions can be provided over the internet outside of office hours.  The Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and farm payments are now available on a 24-seven basis and are being used extensively.  The increase in the level of use of on-line systems in all of these offices is quite dramatic, although this needs to be extended further.</P>
        <P>There are new initiatives in many Departments across the system which are trying to use the best practice developed in Revenue, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and to open up these services.  Two years ago, I announced a package of new initiatives for the implementation group, which is leading the modernisation agenda and is mainly being driven at Secretary General level.  The overall objective of this is to ensure that the right people are in the right place at the right time to service the needs of citizens.</P>
        <P>There has been dramatic improvement.  Approximately 200 staff have been put forward this year for the public service awards, which acknowledge new initiatives, and these come mainly from among staff internally examining the modernisation process and where they can improve services.  To be fair to our public and civil servants, they are dealing with that aspect.  It is also important that, where some Departments bring forward these initiatives, they are then taken as best practice and implemented in other Departments.  Many of these initiatives are the work of one or two people who then win support within a section of a Department.  A substantial amount of work and activity is taking place, and not just in the technology area.</P>
        <P>The idea of physically opening up in the evening is not one that receives support.  Most of the other offices across these areas are not open on Saturdays and the public service unions are, by and large, not in favour of it.  However, to their credit, they have supported the initiatives in the technology area, which can probably satisfy most of the requirements.</P>

	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that we should set a target date &mdash; I suggest 1 January 2011 &mdash; when e-services should be available on-line both to customers and businesses and ensure that target date is implemented?  For the convenience of the customer, there could be on-line payment of court fines, student grants, passport applications, an e-register, on-line social welfare schemes and so on.  Some of these happen reasonably well but there does not seem to be an overall plan which states what will be available at the end of three years with regard to on-line services for business only and on-line services for customers only.  Will the Taoiseach comment?  Does he agree we should set a target date and agree, when laying down the instruction and the direction, that by a certain date e-government should apply in the following range for customers and for business?</P>
        <P>I do not suppose the Taoiseach has had a requirement in recent years to pick up the State telephone directory and make telephone calls because he has had staff to do this for him.  If he did so, he would find there are 70 pages of the directory dealing with Government Departments and State agencies.  It is virtually impossible for somebody who does not use the telephone directory frequently to find the compass to access the number of the agency or organisation they seek.  I have often tried it myself.  One needs to think hard about where the organisation will be in the green pages.  This kind of issue requires clearer labelling or greater definition so people can conduct their business instead of wasting time flicking through pages in the attempt to find a certain regional board, agency or organisation.  It is an area somebody could usefully spend time sorting out.  The Taoiseach could tell me if he has used a directory in the recent past.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They are amazingly fast at finding everywhere.  The issue is hugely complex, which is probably why people use other services.  On the Deputy&rsquo;s first point, whatever about a date for everybody, all of the groups, which are mainly being driven by the senior civil servants and public servants in Revenue, have done much work on this in terms of pressing the reforms and their customer service initiatives which are considered to be probably the best in Europe.  Many Departments are trying to build on this.  For five or six years the Department of Finance has given Departments very good financial assistance in developing on-line services.  Access to many of the services has been enhanced through information technology.  The benefit of that is it allows 24-hour access to information and services in the Civil Service and public service.  That is the way we are going and should continue to go.</P>
        <P>The motor tax on-line system did not exist five or six years ago and now a large part of this business is done at weekends and at night time.  I referred to the e-services operated by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  There was a time when Members were constantly raising in the House the delays in grant payments and whether they would be paid by Christmas.  All of these issues have long been put on-line.  Livestock registration, identification and movement are on-line and are being used extensively by the agriculture sector.</P>
        <P>All of these systems have facilitated easier and more efficient compliance as well.  For example, for the past five years the business sector has had the benefit of the Revenue on-line service, which is outstanding.  It has speeded up and dealt with tax compliance in a way that was not possible previously.  In excess of 90% of revenue business is dealt with through the on-line service.  All of the major companies deal with Revenue exclusively through the use of information technology.  The on-line system has gone from having very low figures to a situation where all of the corporation tax regime is on-line with the exception of a small number of companies.  The on-line service has been rolled out recently to PAYE workers.  A range of services are available, including the claiming of credits and allowances, the on-line receipt for reviews of one&rsquo;s tax position and the on-line reviewing of one&rsquo;s tax record, with the later ones being rolled out as well.</P>
        <P>Regarding opening hours and examining the continuation of the services, there is the General Register Office and the visa office in the Department of Foreign Affairs and also the single payment issues in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  More and more of the State agencies should be pulled together to deal with these issues.  An initiative I have tried to press myself, which I hope will be continued, is to try to cut down the administration in Departments&rsquo; payroll areas.  With modern technology there is no need for every Department or agency of the public service to have its own personnel department and payments records.  My Department&rsquo;s entire payroll is done on the payroll system of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Massive savings are possible within a Department through being able to use the services of other Departments.  From an administrative point of view, the more we can use bigger systems the more we will cut down on the deployment of staff.</P>
        <P>In spite of all the worries and concerns, when one brings in these systems they work out fine and one never hears about them again.  It is just a matter of making a decision to do them.  We have been doing that and it has worked most effectively in my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach mentioned in his first reply to Deputy Kenny that the quality customer service, QCS, research group has been carrying out some survey work on <Col N="280"/>customer satisfaction and public attitudes towards the Civil Service and public service.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House what kind of conclusions have been reached in this research work, whether there are any headline results that he can share with us, or if he has any plans to publish the research findings that have been made?</P>
        <P>I notice the Taoiseach put some emphasis on the development of customer charters etc.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the whole process of reform in the public service and Civil Service is being so formalised that it is becoming an institutional problem in its own right.  The more we move into customer charters, the more we develop a practice of box-ticking.  While I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments on the development of a system of awards, we need to develop an approach to the public service based on encouraging problem-solving and a break-out from the cautious culture innate to all large organisations, which we continue to have.</P>
        <P>In that regard, as we move further into the area of e-Government, on-line services and so on, is there not a danger that the public service and those working in it will become more inaccessible to the public?  When one goes on-line, one does not see or hear anybody.  This is fine for doing business but when one tries to make a telephone call on foot of such business, one must select from many options and press different buttons.  Is there any chance that members of the public would have an element of access to those making decisions in order that the different, very discrete services which can be provided on-line would be joined up and explained to them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first question, the customer charters are all about providing friendly, efficient and courteous service to customers.  Departmental officials continually inform me at meetings that this is the function of charters.  Annual surveys are carried out to monitor performance against these and other commitments.  My Department has been conducting these surveys for a long time based on customer groups and the use of other evaluation methods, including mystery shopping, customer feedback, focus groups and all kinds of great ideas &mdash; although I am not sure how great they are.  This is the modern way to check all these issues.  While I have seen results for Revenue, Social and Family Affairs and my Department, I would not claim to be an expert on other Departments and offices.  However, the surveys constantly show high customer satisfaction ratings and identify sharply areas where improvements can be made.</P>
        <P>The Deputy mentioned that it is always nice to see a human face or hear a human voice and find someone to whom one can get back.  This is an important part of the process, as has been made clear.</P>
        <P>I am not the world&rsquo;s greatest expert in technology by a long shot but those who push information technology and e-Government state that the more one deals with ordinary data collection through technology, the more one is able to use front-line staff to engage with the public.  Departments are making efforts in this regard.  I have long held the view that it saves offices a great deal of trouble to have good people on the telephones and on the front line because they can competently deal with a case from start to finish, whereas junior staff providing front-line services will refer the matter to somebody else.  It is far better to have senior people to do this job.  Offices where this is done provide a far better service to the public because someone who comes in with a query will have it dealt with fully, rather than being told he or she is in the wrong office, should go elsewhere or return another time.</P>

        <P>It is a challenge for the system.  In fairness, public servants come out strongly in examinations of what the public, both businesses and individuals, think of them.  The big effort with the customer quality initiative has been and will be to find out where the flaws are, particularly when dealing with the public, and deal with them.  There are many challenges in this area not necessarily in Departments, but also in health, education and other areas with which we must deal.</P>

        <Quest> the details of the economic analysis carried out by her Department on the impact the World Trade Organisation agreement is expected to have on the beef, dairy, pig and sheep sectors, if accepted in its current format; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current round of WTO negotiations is ongoing and in the coming weeks further intensive efforts will be made to reach agreement in 2008.</P>
        <P>The chair of the WTO agriculture negotiating committee, Crawford Falconer, issued his latest draft modalities paper in February, with a view to making progress in the agriculture negotiations.  These negotiations are now focused on addressing several significant outstanding issues across the domestic support, export competition and market access areas which make up the agriculture negotiating pillar.  Several substantial issues have yet to be decided upon and there is, as yet, no certainty as to a final outcome.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food carries out a continual range of assessments and analyses of the different negotiating proposals that emerge from the WTO discussions.  This analysis covers all agricultural sectors, including the beef, dairy, sheep and pig sectors.  It includes, in particular, the assessment of the impact of these proposals on specific product categories.</P>
        <P>Similar estimations have been made by various representative bodies and shared with the Department.  These detailed calculations are used to evaluate the various negotiating proposals which emerge from the discussions and to develop the Irish negotiating position.</P>
        <P>Several other bodies and research institutes, in Ireland and elsewhere, have also carried out economic studies.  Some of these analyses attempt a broader assessment of possible outcomes of the negotiations.  Inevitably, these studies are based on a wide range of assumptions about issues yet to be decided in the negotiations.  The Department also considers and uses these studies to inform negotiating strategies.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission recently presented its latest analysis of possible impacts of the most recent proposals from the chairman of the WTO agriculture committee.  This analysis is the subject of ongoing discussions between EU member states and the Commission.</P>
        <P>The outcome of these negotiations will represent a significant challenge for Irish and EU agriculture.  I am concerned with the current direction of the negotiations.  I, and my Government colleagues, have and will continue to take every opportunity to express our concerns in the strongest terms in the various EU and WTO meetings dealing with these negotiations.  We have also been very active in seeking allies for our position.</P><Col N="282"/>
        <P>The Government will continue to insist the final WTO agreement is a balanced one.  It will not be acceptable to me or the Government that EU agriculture is sacrificed for the sake of a deal.  The EU has made significant contributions to these negotiations, including the move in the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy reforms to non-trade distorting decoupled payments.  The reforms allowed the EU to commit to significant reductions in the levels of trade distorting supports, particularly in production-linked price supports.  It is the responsibility of other WTO negotiating partners to make equivalent contributions.</P>
        <P>I will continue to insist the Commission pursues balance in the negotiations.  The EU, and in particular EU agriculture, cannot be the banker for this WTO round.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>Much jargon surrounds the whole WTO process and, implicit in that, there is much of it in the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  I am trying to cut through the fog and find out where we stand.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Various bodies have done analyses on the impact of the negotiations.  Does she agree with one analysis that states a 70% tariff reduction in the beef and dairy sector would result in the loss of 50,000 jobs at farm gate level and another 50,000 in the food processing sector, costing the economy &euro;4 billion?  Does that tie in with the Department&rsquo;s analysis of the current proposals on the negotiating table?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Those figures are from the IFA&rsquo;s analysis which I have noted.  I met the IFA, with the Taoiseach, to discuss these figures which are part of all discussions concerning the negotiations.  We are at a difficulty in that we are progressing to a ministerial decision in May and cannot say what will happen.  We have seen the outcome of analyses of a number of proposals over the past seven and a half years.  We do not have a final analysis completed.  The IFA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Department does not have a final analysis.  The IFA has put forward its analysis and met senior officials in the Department.  FAPRI and IBEC have also done their analyses.  All these are part of the negotiations and the team.  We are in a negotiating position.  We have also listened to the EU Commission.  However, I do not have a firm analysis completed on Crawford Falconer&rsquo;s, chairman of the WTO agriculture committee, proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is dancing on a pinhead when answering this question.  She either agrees or disagrees with the IFA&rsquo;s analysis.  What were the consequences envisaged by the Department of the 2005 EU Agriculture Council directive to the Commissioner, Peter Mandelson?  Surely, it had an analysis done on those proposals.</P>

	<P>The agreement in the Hong Kong round was not about market access.  The current WTO negotiations are on this issue.  We have agreed, to an extent, the 2005 proposals from the Hong Kong round.  These were based on parallelism and the methodology being finalised by the Commission and member states, which has not yet happened.  It was based on outcome of financial perspectives.

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;one does not show one&rsquo;s hand.  We were not negotiating market access in 2005.  We are negotiating it in 2007 and 2008.  We could be negotiating it in 2009 and 2010.  Until such time as we reach that, it is inappropriate to analyse because matters are moving.  It would be important for Deputy Creed to understand that we are not at the bottom line phase of negotiations.  There was no bottom line in the Hong Kong round.  We came to a final agreement in 2005 on the issue of export refunds only.</P>

	<P>I hope the Minister will answer this question as it is of vital national interest for on-farm and off-farm employment.  Will the Minister use the veto to defeat the current proposals on the table?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very simplistic of the Deputy to ask this question.  I will only agree that we have had good discussions on this matter in the House.  Every Member, whether involved in agriculture or otherwise, believes the outcome of the WTO negotiations is important.  I believe a balance is the most important outcome that I must attain for Irish agriculture and the agrifood sector.</P>
        <P>We are not yet at a position where a final decision must be made.  There are ongoing discussions in the Commission and among member states.  I will raise this matter once again on Monday when attending the EU Council meeting.  I will also have further discussions with the Commission and like-minded Ministers.  We are in a process and we are not at the stage of making a final decision.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the initiatives being undertaken by her Department to promote farmer participation in forestry in view of the new opportunities presented by the emerging wood energy sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fully aware of the opportunities presented by the emerging wood energy sector.  Wood biomass is one of the most versatile of renewable energy sources and has the potential to play a major role in the supply of Ireland&rsquo;s energy in future.  Solid biomass, mainly wood, is already the largest source of renewable energy in Ireland, accounting for 57% of Ireland&rsquo;s total renewable energy consumption in 2004.</P>
        <P>A new capital grant scheme to support emerging enterprises in the wood chip supply sector was launched by our Department last year.  Under the wood biomass harvesting machinery grant scheme, funding of &euro;500,000 has already been approved to support the purchase of self-<Col N="284"/>contained and self-propelled whole tree chippers.  A second phase of this scheme was launched in late 2007, making an additional &euro;600,000 in grant aid available.  The additional wood energy harvesting capacity created by this support measure will have a significant impact in assisting developing enterprises in the wood chip supply sector.</P>
        <P>Our Department is also supporting a number of pilot projects, such as producer group support, aimed at making more thinnings available to the local energy markets.  Our Department also offers a comprehensive package of incentives and supports which promote farmer participation in forestry.  Some &euro;126 million will be expended by my Department specifically in the forestry sector this year.</P>
        <P>The afforestation premium and grant scheme, for example, combines 100% grants for planting and attractive premiums of up to &euro;574 per hectare payable for 20 years for farmers.  Only last week my Department paid out over &euro;52 million in the annual forestry premium payment to more than 10,000 forest owners, most of whom are farmers.</P>
        <P>Under the forestry environment protection scheme, FEPS, a landowner will receive a FEPS premium of up to &euro;200 for each hectare of woodland planted.  The FEPS premium is payable for five years in addition to the existing afforestation scheme grants and premium available.  Farmers can plant up to 50% of their land and still draw down the full single payment, as well as the forestry premium.  Financial support is also available for the growing forest in the form of grants for forest roads to facilitate access and management operations, for shaping and pruning operations, and for reconstitution in certain circumstances.</P>
   
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">My Department engages in significant promotion of forestry to encourage farmer participation.  Among the range of promotional activities supported are the joint national promotion campaign with IFIC and the RDS awards, which promote good forestry management.  We also support a number of other projects which contribute to the sustainable development of forestry.</P>
        <P>My Department, working in co-operation with COFORD, the National Council for Forest Research and Development, and Teagasc actively encourages the development of the wood-energy sector through a range of support measures aimed at creating an effective and efficient supply chain from the landowner-producer to the end user.  Since 2006, COFORD has been managing the ForestEnergy programme.  The programme includes a series of nationwide forest thinning and chipping demonstrations, workshops and trials aimed at those wishing to become involved in the wood biomass supply chain.</P>
        <P>Funding is also provided to Teagasc, which plays an important role in the development of forestry through promotion, training and advice.  Forestry advisers at Teagasc offices run a number of training courses, information evenings and field days and provide free and independent advice on all aspects of forestry to farmers.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with other State agencies such as SEI and Enterprise Ireland in support of developing an increased biomass percentage of energy supply in Ireland.</P>
   </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the reply from the Minister of State and my response will be very brief.  Does the FEPS encourage the growth of native woodland?  Will the Minister of State potentially consider an additional premium for those farmers, landowners or forestry owners who wish to grow more forestry on the basis that it would reduce CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions for this country?  Perhaps an additional premium could be given to those farmers who are not already growing forestry but who may potentially embark on growing it.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="285"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past couple of years, we have provided many incentives and much encouragement to farmers not already growing forestry to participate in the growing of forestry.  That is one of the main reasons we introduced FEPS.  We considered that many farmers involved in REPS would plant forestry except that the REPS payment was so attractive.  FEPs looks to balance that position and we have noticed that many farmers involved in REPS are looking at forestry as an option in a REPS plan, which is very positive.</P>
        <P>On the native woodland aspect, many of our schemes look to encourage the growing of native woodland.  At this time, some 30% of what is being planted is native woodland.</P>
        <P>It is important to mention that we have promotional schemes and the Deputy may have heard some of the advertisements currently on radio.  We have a joint promotional scheme with IFIC and we also have the RDS awards, which promote good forestry management.  That also involves native woodland and our actions are all about promoting both types.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer but there is potential to give a further premium purely on the basis there is room to have carbon off-setting, for want of a better expression.  There is major scope for the private sector to become involved in forestry.  As I understand it, to date there is less than 20% involvement of the private sector in forestry and it is an area of agribusiness that has even more potential.</P>
        <P>I am not convinced the &euro;7,604 per hectare payment, the maximum, is adequate given that one would have to operate on large economies of scale in order to get some sort of a decent return.  Many smaller forestry owners do not currently have the economies of scale to be able to thin back forests to allow for greater potential.  The cost of thinning and maintenance would eat into the premium.</P>
        <P>We are trying to make a case, in essence, for more grant aid or financial incentives to be provided.  Will the Minister of State consider that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The amount of &euro;7,604 referred to by the Deputy is probably the planting grant.  If a person goes to plant a forest, the cost is covered.  On top of this the person receives an annual premium of &euro;573 per hectare and an additional &euro;200 per hectare for FEPS.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy on growing forestry as it is important for people to maintain and thin them.  If we do not do so, we will not have good timber at the end of the day.  One of our chief promotional issues at the moment in encouraging farmers to go into forestry is to indicate they will get the 20-year premium, the planting grant at the beginning and income tax-free.  We have brought in many schemes under the heading of thinning and maintenance, such as the high pruning of conifer scheme, which is important.  There is also the shaping of broadleaves scheme and a forest road scheme, which helps to maintain forests.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are two messages.  The first is that the 20-year-old forest must be maintained and thinned, and wood energy must be reaped from it.  We encourage farmers to do this.  The second is that it is very worthwhile for farmers to consider forestry as a real option at this stage.  Many REPS farmers are looking at it this year who would not have considered it before.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> when she plans to deliver the &euro;34 million package committed to the development of the sheep sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The series of measures I announced last May in support of the sheep sector constituted my response to the report of the sheep strategy development group, known as the Malone report.  Together, the measures form a comprehensive package that <Col N="286"/>recognises the importance of the sheep sector and addresses the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</P>
        <P>Good progress is being made in implementing the various measures and I am pleased for this opportunity to set out the main points.  Under REPS, my Department secured European Commission approval for a new supplementary measure in REPS 4 promoting mixed grazing of cattle and sheep.  Under this supplementary measure a farmer can qualify for an annual payment of up to &euro;1,000 in addition to his or her basic REPS payment</P>
        <P>Payments of an additional &euro;6 million to qualifying sheep farmers are currently being issued under the 2007 national reserve and all payments are due to issue by the end of May.  Progress is being made by my Department in discussions with ICBF, Teagasc, breed societies and farm bodies on the proposal for ICBF to take over the management of a sheep breed improvement programme for the sheep sector.  It is hoped to have an interim structure in place for the 2008-09 breeding year.</P>
        <P>A capital scheme has been made available for the beef and sheep processing sectors.  Trials are currently under way on the use of new technology to allow for the mechanical grading of carcases in the sheepmeat sector.  The lamb quality assurance scheme, which was established in 2007, has seen almost 6,000 farms being registered to date with over 4,200 farm audits having been carried out.  I have made &euro;400,000 available to support inspections under the scheme.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia will continue to organise strategic marketing campaigns in selected European markets.  Along with its French and British counterparts, Bord Bia is undertaking a three-year generic lamb promotion on the very important French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.  Teagasc has developed a comprehensive plan to restructure sheep support services, including a programme for technology evaluation and transfer farms, which includes hill and lowland areas.</P>
        <P>These measures complement those to be taken by the industry itself in implementation of the Malone report.  I am confident these form the right approach and will help to address potential difficulties.  I remain very much conscious of the concerns within the sector and I raised these at the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting on 17 March.  Definitive conclusions on possible support action were not reached but my concerns were shared by a large number of colleagues and it was generally recognised that the needs of the sector should be borne in mind in the &ldquo;health check&rdquo; of the Common Agriculture Policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  I note the date of the announcement of the package was May of last year, the run-in to a general election.  Regrettably, there has been very little progress on it to date.</P>
        <P>The Minister may need to be reminded of the signs of crisis in the industry at a practical level.  This Easter, consumers could not source an Easter lamb.  Sheep numbers have declined dramatically, as there has been a drop in the region of 2 million ewes in the past number of years.  That is an industry in freefall.  The European Commission recently contracted consultants to advise it on how to stabilise the position and reverse this trend.  The consultants &mdash; Ernst &amp; Young &mdash; were, I am sure, paid a great deal of money to arrive at a recommendation with which the House came up last October to the effect that there should be a return to a direct payment, perhaps &euro;30, to farmers.  There will be an opportunity for the Minister to deliver on this matter under the health check.</P>
        <P>Why was the farm investment scheme suspended, particularly when &euro;8 million in funding for sheep farmers was ring-fenced under it?  At the stroke of a pen, the Minister removed this scheme.  The idiocy behind all this is that on 18 October costings relating to the scheme were <Col N="287"/>published on the Department&rsquo;s website, while on 20 October it was suspended.  Will the Minister reintroduce the farm investment scheme in respect of sheep-handling and fencing grants &mdash; &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;?</P>

	<P>It is an ecumenical matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, that will not happen for another 40 years and Deputy Creed and I will not be too concerned about it.</P>
        <P>We are returning to the position prior to the ewe premium stage.  The Deputy is correct.  There has been a considerable reduction in the number of sheep in the country.  It was on that basis we came together to consider the proposals we could implement and it was from there the Malone report emerged.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is acutely aware that we are not in a position, in a decoupled area, to introduce direct payments.  On the basis of an appreciation of the difficulties involved, however, we introduced a special scheme under both the national reserve and REPS 4.  We are not in a position to witness the final outcome of REPS 4 as a result of difficulties experienced in clarifying the matter.  Clarity now exists, however, and I await the outcome of the applications on 15 May.</P>
        <P>Deputy Creed is correct.  This issue can be dealt with under the health check.  However, we will be obliged to proceed carefully.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not want to pay for it under modulation either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is exactly the issue.  The Commissioner stated that we could consider modulation or that we could examine another formula under which money would be taken from one set of farmers in order to pay another set.  The French do this but they have the option of transferring money from large cereal farmers into the sheep sector.  I would be obliged to take money from beef producers and I am sure Members will agree that this would not be the correct formula.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take a brief final supplementary from Deputy Creed.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="288"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware that we have serious concerns, with which he is in sympathy, regarding compulsory modulation.  We are awaiting the outcome of a number of matters.  We increased the REP scheme by 17%, which is considerable.</P>
        <P>I am not stating it is particularly easy and we must consider a multifaceted approach.  The bottom line is that the consumption of sheepmeat in Europe has decreased dramatically.  The number of people under 45 years of age who consume sheepmeat has reduced to a huge degree.  Even in countries where it is extremely popular, sheepmeat has become quite expensive, particularly in the context of the price farmers obtain for it.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the difficulties surrounding the arrangements recently announced relating to REPS 4; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13252/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The arrangements for REPS 4 are derived from a new regulation, which reflects the European Commission&rsquo;s objective of integrating and harmonising the operation of the various farm payment schemes, including the single payment scheme, REPS and the disadvantaged areas scheme.  For REPS 4, this means that applications to join the scheme must be submitted by 15 May each year.  Payments will relate to the number of months in a year during which a farmer is in a REPS 4 contract and will be released in two phases of 75% and 25%.</P>
        <P>The arrangements we announced recently emerged from intensive discussions between the Department&rsquo;s officials and their counterparts at the Commission.  In those discussions, my officials pointed out that the previous arrangements had worked well since REPS was first introduced in 1994 and had contributed to the success of the scheme, with almost 60,000 farmers participating in REPS 2 and REPS 3 by the end of 2006.  The Commission was adamant, however, that the new regulation must apply to REPS 4.  The discussions, therefore, focused on how to apply the new arrangements in a way that mitigated as far as possible any inconvenience they would create for farmers.  It was in this context that the Commission agreed to special transitional arrangements for farmers in REPS 2 completing their contracts during 2008.  As long as these farmers have submitted applications for REPS by the new closing date of 15 May, they can submit their farm plans thereafter and still receive payment during the year.  The Department&rsquo;s officials have written to every farmer in this category to inform them with regard to what they need to do.</P>
        <P>This was a significant concession by the Commission.  If it had not agreed to these special transitional arrangements at a late stage in the discussions, farmers completing their REPS 2 contracts this year would have had to submit their farm by 15 May or else wait until 2009 to join REPS 4.  The Commission insisted, however, that the new regulation must apply strictly to all other farmers joining REPS 4 in 2008 and to everyone joining the new scheme from next year onward.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">Although payments will now come at different times of the year from those with which farmers have become familiar, no farmer will lose out on his or her payments under REPS 4.  Nevertheless, I am aware that the 15 May deadline for applications and the departure from the <Col N="289"/>existing practice of paying farmers in full at an early point in each year of their REPS contracts are significant changes.  The previous way of doing things was better but we are constrained by the regulations.  I hope that planners, both within Teagasc and in the private sector, will do what they can to accommodate farmers who want to enter REPS 4 this year.  I have asked my officials to make every effort to explain the new rules clearly to both farmers and planners and to be as flexible as possible in implementing them.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that there is no change to the rules governing REPS 2 and REPS 3.  For the remainder of their time in these schemes, farmers will continue to be paid in full at an early stage in each year of their contracts.</P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  There are two issues at stake, which run parallel to each other.  The first is the revised pay arrangements and the second is the deadline of 15 May.  Will the Minister of State confirm that it is the Department&rsquo;s policy to facilitate the maximum take-up of REPS 4.  If that is the case, does he not agree that &mdash; this is the view of Teagasc advisers and independent consultants &mdash; the 15 May deadline by which forms must be completed will be extremely difficult to meet, particularly in light of the volume of applications to be processed?  This deadline coincides with that relating to single farm payments applications, etc.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State consider using a device previously employed by the Department in respect of the farm waste management scheme, namely, the expression of interest form?  Such forms could be submitted by 15 May and completed applications could then be submitted by mid-September.  This would facilitate a much greater take-up of REPS 4.  This package has a potential worth of &euro;70 million to agriculture in this country.  Will the Minister of State consider implementing the proposal I have put forward in order to maximise participation in the scheme?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am appalled that the Department was involved in deception during its promotion of REPS 4 throughout the country, particularly when it was fully aware that revised payment arrangements were on the way.  It did not advise farmers of this fact and encouraged them to transfer from REPS 3 to REPS 4.  The Department also encouraged new entrants to become involved in REPS 4 but did not inform them that the payments would be back-loaded rather than front-loaded.  This will cause severe difficulties for farmers who have obligations to meet in respect of their plans.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether this matter has been decided upon and that there is no possible way for it to be addressed at EU level?  Will he say whether he has failed in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is absolutely correct.  It is extremely important that there should be a maximum take-up of REPS 4.  I feel particularly strongly about this in light of how closely it is linked to the development of the organic sector.  There are many factors involved and I share the Deputy&rsquo;s enthusiasm for them.</P>
        <P>What we have arrived at, as a result of banging together a number of heads, is a compromise and this is particularly predicated on the fact that it is an EU regulation.  I reject any impression that anyone was involved in deliberately misleading people.  REPS 2 and REPS 3 had been in operation and no red flags were raised.  There was, as a result, a natural expectation that REPS 4 could continue in a similar vein.</P>

	<P>The report of the seafood strategy review group, Steering a New Course &mdash; also known as the Cawley report &mdash; includes a number of recommendations aimed specifically at enhancing the value and quality of Irish seafood in the areas of both marketing and processing.  The implementation of the report is being overseen by the seafood strategy implementation group, which is chaired by Dr. Noel Cawley, and substantial progress has been made in putting the recommendations into operation in the past 12 months.  The Government has adopted the Cawley report in full and I fully support the work being done in implementing the recommendations.</P>
        <P>The potential for sales growth and import substitution is most effectively addressed by enhancing national production and meeting the needs of the market.  The Cawley report sets down a vision for a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry that will maximise its long-term contribution to coastal communities.  The strategy clearly recognises that the long-term vision for the seafood sector must revolve around developing a strong and positive identity for Irish seafood on the domestic market and in key international export markets.  This identity will assist in positioning Irish seafood products at the upper end of the industry&rsquo;s targeted market.  To do this we must work aggressively to ensure that Irish seafood is recognised for excellence in product quality, the provision of a superior eating experience due to product freshness facilitated by frequent landings, a range of positive environmental traits and a customer service approach second to none.</P>
        <P>The strategy recognises that the industry&rsquo;s approach to the market and its performance within the marketplace are well below those of other sectors of the Irish food industry.  It considers that this gap in performance represents an industry opportunity.  The recommendations of the strategy across all fronts &mdash; marketing, processing, aquaculture and the fleet &mdash; offer a blueprint for change in the industry which will maximise the value of seafood, delivering a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry.</P>
        <P>The seafood strategy has been endorsed by the Government and its efficient and effective implementation is my top priority.  I am satisfied that we have already achieved significant progress and work on delivery of the full range of recommendations is well advanced.  I am confident that we can look forward to a strong and vibrant seafood sector that can compete successfully on the domestic and international markets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  At the heart of this question is the empowerment of consumers to make informed decisions.  It is not in any way against imports.  We must ensure that I or a housewife, as consumers, know what we are buying. <Col N="292"/> For example, when one goes into a restaurant or into one&rsquo;s local fish shop, SuperValu or Tesco and sees fish on the counter, one does not know whether it is Irish or imported fish.  It has been put to me that the busiest fish port in the country is Cork Airport.  I am not against imports, but I believe there is a significant opportunity for displacement by Irish fish of high quality.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State have any plans to pursue a policy similar to that pursued in the beef sector which resulted in the formation of F&eacute;ile Bia?  The Seafood Circle initiative is good as far as it goes but it has only been taken up by around 100 outlets.  Is there a way to empower consumers so that they know what they are purchasing?  When one goes to a fish shop, one assumes that the fresh fish has been caught in the last couple of days.  However, if it has come in from Cork Airport it may have been out of the sea for two or three weeks.  That is not fresh fish.  Consumers need that information so they can make informed decisions.  Does the Minister have any proposals in this area?</P>

	<P>The Cawley report raised many of the issues mentioned by the Deputy.  We are working with the industry at present, particularly with BIM, our marketing body.

      </Speaker>

	<P>When will that happen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>In the next few weeks.  The difficulty is that 55% of fish consumption in Ireland consists of cod and salmon, and we are not catching enough cod and salmon to meet the demands of the Irish consumer at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a cod if I ever heard one.  It is rubbish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation body is working on this matter.  Some of the suggestions put forward by the Deputy are being developed at the moment within the Cawley implementation group.  This is the first time we have had a road map for the fishing industry covering the next five to ten years.  In addition, all strands of the industry are working together to implement the strategy and make sure we have a vibrant and sustainable fishing industry in the future.</P>

	<P>Changes in fertiliser costs, in common with all elements of intermediate consumption for farmers, are principally a function of market forces, in this instance primarily at international level.  The main reason for the sharp increase in fertiliser prices this year is the fact that world demand far outstrips supply.  Increased world demand is such that fertiliser plants do not have the productive capacity necessary to respond.  Increasing use of fertiliser is a prerequisite for improving the demand-supply balance of food worldwide and also for increasing crop production for energy and biofuel.  The most significant component of increased demand for fertiliser for food production is coming from expanding economies such as India <Col N="293"/>and China, while increased demand from South America and Canada is for biofuel production.  Russia and America, previously exporters of fertiliser, are retaining their own production this year.</P>
        <P>Other factors leading to increased costs for fertiliser worldwide are the increasing price of oil, which is a major contributor to the overall cost of fertiliser production, and increased shipping costs worldwide due to high economic global activity in areas such as China and India, which is leading to a deficit in shipping capacity.  Within the EU, the decision to return former set-aside land to crop production has also contributed to increasing demand for fertiliser.</P>
        <P>Since the closure of IFI in 2002, Ireland has had no indigenous inorganic fertiliser production and as such is totally dependent on imports.  Furthermore, Ireland&rsquo;s location on the fringe of Europe implies increased shipping costs and a lack of economies of scale in the area of shipping.  One option for Irish farmers is to use imported inorganic fertiliser for crop production as efficiently as possible, having regard to good agricultural and environmental practices at all times.  Organic fertilisers produced on farms, such as slurry and farmyard manure, have now become even more valuable as sources of nutrients for crop growth and should be used as efficiently as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P el="0">Figures produced by the Central Statistics Office in February of this year indicate that volume of fertiliser used by Irish farmers decreased by 7.8% in 2007.  This shows a clear effort by the farming community to apply fertiliser in an efficient manner, reducing the volume used while maintaining production levels.  This resulted in a decline in fertiliser spending from &euro;379.4 million in 2006 to &euro;358.9 million in 2007, a reduction of 5.4%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State will be acutely aware of the problem of greenhouse gas emissions from chemical fertilisers, particularly nitrous oxide, which is one of the most potent greenhouse gases.  Would the Minister consider the undertaking by his Department, in conjunction with bodies such as Teagasc and experts in the industry, of a review of the nitrates directive?  Organic nitrogen has an advantage in terms of locking carbon into the soil.  Without compromising water quality, will the Minister of State undertake a review of the nitrates directive so we might switch from organic to inorganic nitrogen sources?</P>

	<P>I have asked that question myself and the answer I have been given by people who are in the business of studying these matters scientifically is that the application of slurry outside the allowed times would not be beneficial in that it would be going onto ground which essentially is not for growing and would not improve the growth of crops.  There is a need to examine the science behind it as well as simply looking for a way of getting rid of something which is valuable.  Given the increase in fertiliser costs, the options for farmers need to be more widely considered than even my reply envisages.  In other words, the uptake of organic farming becomes more attractive as the inputs for non-organic methods increase.  Therefore, we need to examine the bigger picture, which is something farmers will be doing in any event.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a danger that availability could be an issue?  The Minister of State said there are major issues concerning the importation and exportation of fertiliser.  In hindsight, was it a mistake to close IFI?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it was.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>This question will require a far broader view than simply asking what Ireland can do.  Ireland still had to import gas and fossil fuels to operate IFI, so there was no great merit in simply locking ourselves into that dependency.  We need to look at global food production, which will require further evaluation of other methods.  I am currently reading a lot of material on climate change, nutrient use and sustainability, which indicates that more organic production methods are inevitable.  It is not an option or a lifestyle choice because in future we will not have the fossil fuel that underpins the current agricultural system.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>

	<P>Not a bad one.  Does the Deputy have a shovel?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The chickens are coming home to roost following the loss of IFI, which has resulted in increasing costs for importing fertiliser.  We do not know the exact content of fertilisers imported from third countries because there is no policing of urea and other contents.  The Department should put in place some policing mechanism to ensure the content is what it says on the tin.  This has permutations for growers and crop production generally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suspect Deputy Doyle has a similar question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I was interested to hear that the Minister of State is studying various papers but we are an island nation.  A couple of years ago, I conducted some research on the use of marinure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure there is a question coming.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>There is. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>We just have to wait for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister of State could include marinure, which is seaweed fertiliser, in his study documents as it might kill many birds with the one stone.  Instead of continuously talking about organic farming, we might use the term traditional farming more <Col N="295"/>often because it is far more practical and workable in the long run.  Organic fertiliser is not actually organic according to the Minister of State&rsquo;s terminology.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am quite happy to talk about traditional agriculture but organic agriculture as it is now practised takes on board traditional agriculture with the research that is being carried out for the efficient use of resources.  The use of seaweed in my constituency of Dublin North is the bedrock of the horticultural industry there, so to that extent I am very familiar with the potential of maritime resources.  In addition to the horticultural sector, seaweed has also been widely used scientifically on many golf courses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no food in golf courses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not going to make any puns about the greens.  As regards Deputy Sherlock&rsquo;s point, there are standards for imported fertilisers.  The manufacturers are required to indicate on the bag the actual components.  If the Deputy has any evidence of sharp practice or shortcuts in this regard, he should bring it to my attention.  I am sure Teagasc would be keen to hear more about that.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the changes she would wish to see emerge from a review of the 2003 CAP reform. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13094/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the health check of the CAP, which is currently underway.  The first phase of this process was completed with the agreement of Council conclusions at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March.  I was generally pleased with the outcome.  The next phase will begin when the legislative proposals are published in May.  Bearing in mind that the review is intended to be a fine-tuning exercise of the 2003 reforms and not a fundamental reform, I expect the outcome to be limited in terms of policy change but strong on delivery of improvements to current systems.</P>
        <P>The main change which I would like to see emanating from this review is the delivery of further operational simplification to farmers in a way that brings genuine and tangible benefits at farm level.  By this I mean simplification of those elements of the single payment regulation that are causing unnecessary bureaucracy, such as the restrictive rules on management of the national reserve, the modulation refund, the lack of advance payment options and so on.  I am also anxious to simplify cross-compliance by removing redundant statutory management requirements.  In this regard I have submitted practical suggestions on simplification, which I trust the Commission will take on board when framing the legislative proposals.</P>
        <P>Second, I would like to see some widening of national discretion to address specific issues that may arise.  I am thinking of the references in the Commission communication to an expanded article 69, the option of moving to flatter rates of payment, the establishment of minimum payment areas or amounts, and risk and crisis management measures.  The health check should provide options to member states to adjust the common support mechanisms in a way that suits them best, and we should not impose the same solutions on all.</P>
        <P>I remain opposed to the proposed increase in the modulation rate.  While I am fully supportive of measures under pillar 2 of the CAP I do not believe that they should be funded at the expense of a reduction in funding for pillar 1.  I would like this review to provide the certainty and stability that farmers need to adapt to the decoupled payment regime.</P><Col N="296"/>
        <P>Another important issue is that of milk quotas.  Assuming their abolition by 2015 as envisaged by the Commission, I want to see a soft landing.  A gradual increase in quotas is the most sensible and logical way to achieve this.  Clear and final policy decisions are needed so that stakeholders can plan their production decisions over the coming years with confidence.  In addition, I am seeking to retain the existing market management measures in place to cater for any price volatility that may occur with the expiry of restrictions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I welcome the fact that part of his forward strategy concerns simplification, which is of great importance particularly as everything surrounding the CAP is so bureaucratic.  Many politicians and farmers supported CAP reform in 2003 because they believed it would preserve farmers&rsquo; interests in future.  There are major concerns at the moment, however, particularly concerning the WTO talks and subsidies.  There are serious worries about these matters.  Does the Minister agree that trust has been abused by Commissioner Mandelson given his willingness to go along with the demands of others at the WTO talks concerning EU support grants?  Would the Minister also agree that the Lisbon treaty&rsquo;s proposed further diminution of national sovereignty and representation bodies will make it more difficult to defend Irish interests if the treaty is accepted?  I would like to know the Minister&rsquo;s stand on the present talks, which are central to the survival of Irish farming.  There is huge concern, particularly within the IFA.  I heard the Minister referring to this earlier, so I would like to know what is the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Commissioner Mandelson and the WTO talks have very little to do with the CAP health check.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, has raised all the issues and concerns relevant to Irish farmers, such as simplification, modulation, milk quotas and market management mechanisms.  She has appointed two groups to advise her, one to look at proposed changes to the health check and the other to act as the dairy consultative committee.  The Minister is being well advised on the difficulties farmers face and the need for changes to the health check.  From a political point of view, talks will begin in Slovenia in late May.  </P>

	<P>One of the major failures of the Government in the past ten years has been its inability to plan properly and match resources to plans that have been conceived.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the workings of the Health Service Executive, HSE, which has become a monstrosity.  Every day we see evidence of gross mismanagement and an inability to use facilities for which the taxpayer has paid.</P>
        <P>This week I have evidence that a mother of six children was sent notification from the HSE to attend for oncology services on 23 September 2008.  However, she has been deceased for 17 years.  Last week there was other evidence of this nature.</P>
        <P>For years the HSE, supported by the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children, has said it is working on plans to provide a new regional hospital in the north east.  According to its official website this project will take five to seven years to complete.  Unfortunately, in pursuit of this project, the taxpayer has had to fork out hundreds of thousands of euro for consultants to write a report on where it should be located.  Last Friday the cat was let out of the bag when the mild-mannered Minister for Foreign Affairs said there is no money to build such a facility.  Until now the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and other Ministers, including the Minister for Health and Children, said this is a major flagship project and that health infrastructure, which was allocated &euro;5.8 billion in the national development plan, would have first call on major projects, even before Exchequer cuts on taxes.</P>
        <P>The Government has reneged on its commitment to cut taxes.  I ask the Taoiseach to publish a list of the capital projects in the health area, contained in the national development plan, that are to proceed and a list of the projects that are not to proceed?  After ten years the Government must provide clarity on this major flagship project, or phantom, as the case may be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what error led to the first issue raised by the Deputy but I apologise to the family involved as such things should not happen.</P>
        <P>No decision has been made by the Government or the HSE on the location of the new regional hospital in the north east.  No proposal has come before the health committee or the Government in this regard.  The HSE stated about 18 months ago that it would examine the services and that a hospital in one location would be best for the region covering Monaghan, Cavan, Meath and Louth.  It has examined the long-term feasibility of various options and at this stage no proposal has been made.  Deputy Kenny should not be surprised that resources have not been set aside in the capital programme for a proposal that has not even been made by the board of the HSE.</P><Col N="299"/>
        <P>The multi-annual programme for health and the annual capital programme are published every year around May or June by the HSE, as the health boards did previously, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The priority, the immediate task facing the north east, is the organisation of services relating to patient safety.  The Government has put significant resources into that area.  The HSE advised the Department that it recently received a report from a consultancy firm it commissioned to carry out an independent study on the possible location of a new regional hospital.  That study was to take into account the various criteria, including demographics, access, planning, development considerations and inter-dependencies.  The HSE has indicated that the report is scheduled to be discussed by the HSE at its board meeting tomorrow.  Funding, through the national development plan, for the development of services in the north east will be allocated in the light of specific plans to achieve patient safety and quality care objectives.  The big task in the north east for the next few years is to ensure the present hospitals and, particularly, the designated hospitals build up first class patient services and that the other hospitals provide the services allocated to them.  That is a task that hopefully can be implemented over the next few years.  The optimum and long-term plan is obviously some years away.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is probably worse than we had thought.  I accept the Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology to the family of the deceased person.  It should not be necessary for him to have to do this but I am glad he did because of the blatant failure of HSE management to deal with it properly.  One can understand the hurt caused.</P>
        <P>The HSE website states &ldquo;welcome to northeast health.ie&rdquo;.  It goes on to say that the HSE is working in the north east to develop the most modern, integrated, safe, patient-focused service that has ever been devised in this country and it will be based around one new regional hospital.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, said on 14 June 2006 that the Teamwork management services report and the report by Judge Maureen Harding Clark on Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital conclude that the five local hospitals where acute services are provided are not up to standard and that we want to build best international practice supported by a new regional hospital.  This apparently has become a phantom entity if we take what the Taoiseach has said here today.  He is right to say that designated hospitals within the region should have a service built up that is commensurate with best standards.  One can understand the complete frustration of people in that region when the Minister, Deputy Harney, the Government and Professor Drumm have created a pointless crisis where services have been being stripped away from Monaghan and from other hospitals in the locality on the basis that the extra services would be provided in the new regional entity.</P>
        <P>Cavan Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda are bursting at the seams.  The medical personnel at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital told me that its section dealing with children is on the edge and lives with pressure every day because of the extent of the work taking place there and the lack of facilities.  The Taoiseach has not said whether this was in the national development programme.  The T&aacute;naiste said in 2006 that we would have a new regional hospital.  We are going to provide international best standard in a new regional hospital.  What is in store for the existing five hospitals in the north east?  What extra services will be built up in Cavan Hospital and in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda?  What services will remain in Dundalk, Monaghan and Navan hospitals?  Even if authorisation was given for this to go ahead today, it is a ten or 15 years project and could cost up to &euro;1 billion.  What has happened is a pointless crisis.  Professor Drumm said this morning that the HSE is entitled to strip out services on the basis that people had an expectation that a regional entity would deal with all of these facilities for the times ahead.  Was this new regional hospital ever in the <Col N="300"/>national development programme?  Will the Taoiseach publish a list of the capital projects that will go ahead under the national development programme and a list of those that will not go ahead?  Can I take it that the commitment of Government and the Ministers for Finance and Health and Children is to ensure that the existing hospitals will have services allocated to them developed to the highest standard?  Will he confirm whether the Government intends to go ahead with the regional hospital for the north east which has been the cause of so much angst, frustration and concern for medics, people and patients alike?</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two separate questions here.  Deputy Kenny asked the position of the five hospitals in the region, Cavan, Monaghan, Drogheda, Dundalk and Navan.  The immediate money in this year&rsquo;s capital programme and the next few years capital programme, as Professor Drumm pledged at recent meetings, is to provide better standards of service in those hospitals and to ensure they have sufficient expert staff at every level to provide a top class service.  He has stated publicly on numerous occasions that in some of those hospitals, services would be taken from them and developed in some of the other hospitals.  It is his view that mainstream consolidated services would provide the best service from a health and patient safety point of view, build up critical mass and avoid the kind of issues mentioned in some of the recent reports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>That has not happened.  It is not a saving.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, some of the other hospitals in the region, rather than being acute hospitals, will develop services probably more orientated towards day cases and particular services but not sophisticated surgery.  He has made that clear.  To do that will require significant resources to develop the hospitals that are considered to be the acute hospitals &mdash; having coronary care units, intensive care units and the other sophisticated services required.  Those services will not be available in all five hospitals.  That is the process that is being developed and has been stepped up in recent years.  All of the hospitals will be there but will replicate or duplicate the same services or specialties.  Clearly that is the position.  </P>
        <P>The HSE did commission its own independent study.  The view of the consultancy firm was for a possible location for one regional hospital in the area.  Obviously that would not mean that all the other regional hospitals would close but that would be the centre of excellence that would carry the main specialties.  The position is that the HSE has only now advised the Department that it has received a report, prepared by a consultancy firm which it commissioned to carry out an independent study on a possible location for a regional hospital.  The study was to take account of the various criteria, looking to the next ten and 20 years of demographics, access, planning, development considerations and other inter-dependencies.  I have not seen <Col N="301"/>that report, or a report on that report.  I chaired the health committee but I have not seen any outline of the report.  I understand it has not been discussed by the board of the HSE.  I understand it is on the agenda for tomorrow.  The Deputy asked if the Government has signed up to something nobody has seen, that has not been discussed by the HSE and if it has provided resources for that and the answer is we have not made that decision.  It would not have been wise if we had made that decision.</P>
        <P>We have huge resources in the national development plan for health, some of which are designated and included in the multi-annual report.  Every year we issue a detailed report, down to the last few hundred thousand euro of what will be spent by the HSE across the country.  It is included in the multi-annual report and block figures are included for future developments which are not specified.  If the Deputy asks me if we are going to start this hospital, agree the location and have it built in the space of the next national development plan, by 2012, I do not think it is likely based on the time it takes to undertake major hospital developments.  It is not going to happen.</P>
        <P>Is it seen as best practice that we agree on one state-of-the-art hospital for the north east?  If all the expert opinion is that this should be done, putting main specialties and critical mass of the hospital for that region into one location, the Government will agree.  This must come secondary to what the Government is adamant on.  We want to see existing services for the present day population &mdash; people who need services now &mdash; built up and properly maintained and sustained for the future.  Longer term plans are for the longer term and we do not want to start closing and displacing services, making life difficult for the present day population, particularly the aged, in advance of having a clearly articulated plan in the long term.</P>

	<P>In the month of March, unemployment rose in the State by 12,000, the highest monthly increase ever recorded.  It is not entirely due to construction because the numbers are equal for men and women.  It is not a blip because in the first quarter of this year, we have seen the highest rise in unemployment in a quarter for over 30 years.  The previous high was in 1975, in the middle of the oil crisis.</P>
        <P>In the first quarter of this year the Government took in &euro;600 million less in tax than expected.  On top of that, a report on the number of new house registrations in the month of March shows the figure has fallen to less than 1,000, down 73%.  On top of that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, told us there is not a red cent to build a new hospital.  Is that true?  Is it true that there is not a red cent to build a new hospital and is that an accurate <Col N="302"/>summary of the state of the public finances?  Is that the bottom line on the stewardship of Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, of the public purse that there is not a red cent left to build a public hospital?</P>
        <P>Can the Taoiseach tell the House the new initiatives, if any, the Government intends to take to deal with the changed and changing economic circumstances in which we find ourselves?  Does the Government have plans to protect employment in businesses?  What plans exist to provide for those losing employment?  What new initiatives does the Government intend to take to deal with the new economic times?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As it does every year, the Government will spend something in the order of &euro;15 billion to &euro;16 billion in the health services plus an enormous capital programme.  I will not go back over the issues in health.</P>
        <P>Regarding Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s economic question, and on unemployment particularly, in responding to issues of an economic and fiscal nature we have been upfront about the risks for the past six months.  It is important to remain calm and avoid taking short-term, knee-jerk reactions that could damage our long-term prospects.  As I continually said in the House, when the full figures for 2007 were produced, we would see that the economy was strong, if contracting in the last quarter.  We know the GDP rate for last year and that the economy grew by 5.4%, far higher than people expected.</P>
        <P>The situation in the markets over the past month reflects international issues rather than specific Irish concerns, as we are all aware.  From our economic position the fundamentals are very strong, a fact borne out by the national account figures, which are there for everyone to see.  Employment continues to grow, there are very low national debt levels and we have a very flexible economy.  This is not just my view but the view of most economic commentators.  We are addressing the short-term challenges from a position of strength.  Our medium-term prospects are favourable.  The lowest economic figure for growth for this year from the economic houses is not in the negative &mdash; it is 2.2% and rising to 3.5% next year and still growing in a difficult period.</P>
        <P>Last week&rsquo;s Exchequer returns indicate a very good performance in income tax, which is up 5% on the same period last year.  This shows the real health of the Irish economy and reflects the most important part of economic activity, employment, which remains strong.  It is a positive indicator of the resilience of the Irish economy, even at a more difficult time.  We are not complacent and fiscal policy is addressing the more pressing economic situation in a number of ways.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question is a fair one and in response I will refer to three of those ways.  We are giving priority to measures that enhance our productive capacity.  The continued roll-out of the national development plan at the highest level this country has ever done and far higher than any other European country at over 6% is giving us an infrastructure and investment programme that is helping the economy through a difficult period.  We are slowing the rate of the increase in current spending, which is necessary, and we are removing uncertainty in the housing market through the changes made in stamp duty and increases in the ceiling for mortgage relief and interest rates.</P>
        <P>In the past three and a half years, from autumn 2004 to spring 2008, a relatively short period, employment has grown by 243,000 or 13%, with unemployment increasing by only 15,200 in the same period.  It is generally accepted that the rate of growth in the economy and in employment over the past few years could not continue at that rate.  Still, we are in a very strong position.  Looking back over that period, with almost 250,000 jobs created and unemployment increasing by only 15,000, the figures speak for themselves.  The live register figures for March, released recently, show the number of people signing on has increased to almost 198,000.  That <Col N="303"/>is the highest since August 1999 and the highest at this time of the year since March 1999 and reflects these increases.  Looking at what is happening in the economy and quarter on quarter growth, we are still in an extremely healthy position, but we must manage ourselves through this period.  With almost 2.25 million people working in the economy, we are in a strong position to get through what is hopefully a short-term difficult position, which is how the Central Bank, the European Central Bank, the OECD and every economic analysis group here and in the European context views this.</P>

	<P>The message the Taoiseach is giving the House in response to what we all know are changed and changing economic circumstances &mdash; that the Government will continue to do what it has been doing &mdash; is depressing.  The idea that the situation is due to international circumstances and has nothing to do with us domestically is wrong.  To paraphrase our good friend, the former American President, Bill Clinton, &ldquo;it is not the international economy, stupid&rdquo;.  This is about events in the domestic economy to which the decline in revenue, capital gains tax and VAT is directly related.</P>
        <P>The unemployment figure is 200,000.  When it was 200,000 some 20 years ago, people marched in the streets about it.  People are losing their jobs.  The problem must be addressed by new initiatives.  I will suggest a couple.  First, building workers losing their jobs in residential construction could build schools.  We have a schools programme that could be accelerated and the skills required in building schools are approximately the same as those required in residential construction.</P>
        <P>Second, there could be a training and upskilling programme through F&Aacute;S and the educational institutions so that we do not make the mistake made previously, that is, people going onto the dole when they lose their jobs.  We should have a system whereby people who lose their jobs can avail of opportunities to retrain and upskill.</P>
        <P>Third, it is manifestly clear to all of us that cuts are being effected in essential public services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;such as home help and other areas that are under the radar and do not get the type of attention they would normally receive.

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to get into a debate on last week&rsquo;s figures, but if the Deputy looks at the figures, which his question was about, concerning the performance of taxes he will see that income tax is up 5% compared to the same period last year and is directly related to employment, showing the real health of the Irish economy and reflecting how the most important part of economic activity, which is employment, is remaining strong in a period where there is a sharp international downturn mainly because of sub-prime lending and the fact that oil is at over $100 per barrel.</P>
        <P>I do not want to get into a debate about the figures but, if we are talking about unemployment being at 5%, when we had marches 20 years ago, lest the Deputy forget, it was because we had managed and were lucky to keep unemployment at just under 20%.  Our labour market <Col N="304"/>15 years ago when I was chairperson of the Cabinet committee on employment included 1.25 million people working.  Today, we have 2.25 million people working, a substantial part of which has been an increase in recent years.</P>
        <P>Overall, if one looks at tax receipts on income, we were &euro;600 million or 5% behind target in the first three months of the year.  Over half of the shortfall is due to the poor performance of capital gains tax, which reflects the more adverse conditions in equity and property markets.  That is the analysis of those in Revenue and the Department of Finance who have looked at this issue.  It is largely driven by the necessary housing market correction, which is well under way.  It is a source of satisfaction to me that, for the first time since 1999, the Central Bank is saying that house prices are at sustainable levels.  In no way should we feel anything other than satisfaction in that regard.  If the Central Bank can say for the first time in nine years that house prices have reached a sustainable level, it supports the recent actions the Government was forced to take.</P>
        <P>Yes, it is a fact that taxes are down in the area of development lands and that developers are not developing as much.  The only ironic thing about this is that, while I have spent my entire period as Taoiseach defending the fact that it is a good thing for the economy that developers and development land were moving ahead and striving, now that it has come down for the first time, it is seen as a criticism.  I am glad to see that the view articulated on this side of the House &mdash; that a construction industry, development, capital gains tax and capital-related taxes are good for the economy &mdash; is shared for the first time in the period in which I have been Taoiseach by everyone else in the House.</P>

	<P>I am at a loss to understand the reason for a Revised Estimate this late in the year.  The subject pertains to the public service broker arrangement, or REACH, which was meant to cost the taxpayer &euro;14 million but eventually came in at a figure of &euro;37 million.  This note from the Whip shows clearly it has been abandoned by the Government in an under the counter fashion without a direct debate in this House.  Overall, the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report demonstrates that the entire business of e-government and public service access ended up costing an additional &euro;88 million.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to red cents earlier today in respect of the comments by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern that there was not a red cent available for the hospital in Navan.  This is where the red cents have gone.  They have gone down the drain.  This report refers to a Cabinet decision in March to abandon the REACH project and transfer it to the Department of Finance.  This is to be done under the counter without a word directly in this House and I do not consider that to be good enough.  The Government must have acknowledged at the aforementioned Cabinet meeting that the public service broker project was a fiasco and that the Comptroller and Auditor General was correct to conclude that &euro;25 million <Col N="307"/>was wasted on this element of the e-government project out of a total wastage of &euro;88 million.  Incidentally, this figure does not include the &euro;55 million to &euro;60 million spent by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on e-voting.</P>

However, in a couple of months time, &euro;8 million will mean a great deal to those who will not have their home help services.  Today, Members are saying &ldquo;rest in peace&rdquo; to a waste of &euro;88 million.  In the context of this particular heading, the project was to cost &euro;14 million and involved all the top people from the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance, who agreed on a budget of &euro;14 to &euro;15 million.</P>

The transfer of functions &mdash; obviously if one transfers the functions, one must transfer the associated funds &mdash; has been agreed with effect from 1 April.  The transfer of funding is for &euro;8.6 million in the published Estimates for the Departments of Finance and Social and Family Affairs, which now are out of date.  For this reason, further Revised Estimates will be prepared for these two Departments and will be laid before the D&aacute;il prior to discussion of those Estimates.

Does the Taoiseach propose to comply with the usual protocol so that he will have an opportunity to announce his formal resignation to the D&aacute;il?

	<P>On the first question, we can be clear on the position.  We are talking about the referendum date being 12 June, which is agreed by everybody at this stage.  I thought last week that the House was due to meet on 6 May but it will not.  I will tender my resignation to the President on that date.  If we are to say anything in the House, it will be before that date, but that is a matter for the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise two matters with the Taoiseach.  First, I understand that Mr. John Purcell, who has been the Comptroller and Auditor General since 1994, is due to retire on 14 May.  This is a constitutional office and I understand the method of appointment is that the new Comptroller and Auditor General is nominated by the D&aacute;il for appointment by the President.  What process is being put in place to make a new appointment or to bring a proposal to the House for the nomination of a new Comptroller and Auditor General?  Will there be consultation with the Opposition parties on this matter, what are the plans and will there be an opportunity, through the Whips, for the House to pay tribute to the good work of the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General?</P>
        <P>The second issue I want to raise is in regard to promised legislation.  The two Green Ministers, who were with us momentarily, seem to have left the House again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Against a great deal of opposition, policy was finally changed and it is now occasionally possible to get a taxi.  No sooner has that happened, however, but moves are afoot to put a cap on the number of taxis in Dublin.

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, I express my regret that once again a request under Standing Order 32 has not been deemed acceptable by you, having regard to the fact that, according to the Chair, these matters are not considered either urgent or important&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;enough to facilitate debate.</P>
        <P>I refer to the matter of promised legislation, in particular No. 8 under the remit of criminal justice, as indicated by the Taoiseach a moment ago in response to Deputy Durkan.  I ask the Taoiseach in regard to the criminal justice miscellaneous provisions Bill, which has been on the pink sheet for some time, to ensure that not only will this legislation come forward as a matter of urgency but that it will include appropriate provisions, as promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Taoiseach himself, to deal with improved legislative provisions on the matter of electronic surveillance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>The Deputy has much experience and he knows we cannot go into that.  When will the legislation be introduced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That legislation will be introduced this session.</P>
        <P>If I can revert to Deputy Michael D. Higgins&rsquo;s question, the criminal justice (mutual assistance) Bill will enact certain of the measures and the remaining requirements will be dealt with by the prevention of corruption Bill which is at an advanced stage of preparation.  A small number of drafting issues remain for the Parliamentary Counsel to deal with.  That is one of the issues and I will check the other matter he raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>To give assistance on that matter, a Cheann Comhairle, I very much appreciate the information given by the Taoiseach on the United Nations Convention against Corruption.  The convention to which I referred this afternoon is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I acknowledge that Ireland has played a role in drafting the convention but it is very important that we indicate that we intend to ratify that convention if we are to have framework legislation giving rights to people with disabilities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, was in Opposition he asked the Taoiseach about the foreshore (coastal management) Bill perhaps 100 times.  It seems almost centuries ago since he was in Opposition.</P>

	<P>Is there any chance of that Bill coming forward?</P>
        <P>Just before the baton passes from Drumcondra to Tullamore, I draw the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention to the grave concerns of the Stardust committee, an important committee on the north side of Dublin, regarding the inquiry which he permitted to be established approximately six to nine months ago.  Is it possible for him to satisfy the committee regarding its concerns and to get back to me on the matter?</P>

	<P>I do not have a date for the legislation but the Bill will be apportioned ministerial responsibility.  I indicated earlier that this legislation is due but there is no date for it.  I will revert to the Deputy on the other issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the situation regarding proposed legislation on management companies?  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions.  Many householders have bought apartments and houses in managed complexes and they are facing very high charges.  There are many legal unknowns&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which people find exceptionally difficult to deal with.  Some months ago the Taoiseach informed me there was a Government committee chaired or at least initiated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Has that committee reported?  The Taoiseach indicated that the ramifications of this were far broader than had at first been appreciated by Government but in the meantime, many householders face enormous difficulties.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three different aspects to this, namely, the property services Bill to which I already referred, which is due; there is also a company law aspect to the matter which comes under the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin; and there is an environmental aspect.  The Ministers have been working in co-operation to co-ordinate the matter.  I made the point some months ago that the issue is most complex because until we get all three strands of legislation enacted we cannot deal properly with this issue.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to do this.</P>

However, when I asked about the same legislation before Easter, I was told it would be taken during that session.  People are hanging on by their fingertips and running out of funds trying to pay the cost of nursing homes.  I asked last week whether an interim measure would be introduced.  Will the Taoiseach give a definitive estimate as to when the Bill will come before the House?  He has informed the House that major legal issues have arisen but we have not been given an understanding as to when the Bill will finally come to fruition.</P>

	<P>On two Bills in the pink document allegedly to be taken this session, will the Taoiseach indicate if it is anticipated they will be published this month or next month?  I ask because the two Bills in question have been around for many years.  The first would provide for the establishment of a DNA database.  I recall that when the Ceann Comhairle was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform he announced, in a great fanfare of publicity, that the legislation was about to be published.  That was eight years ago.  When will we see the legislation?  The provision of a DNA database is a necessity and Ireland stands out in Europe in not having such a database.  The second Bill is the adoption Bill to implement the Hague Convention on Foreign Adoptions.  This legislation had, to my best recollection, been promised for six years.  Will the Taoiseach indicate in what month these Bills will be published and whether the House will have an opportunity during this session and before the summer vacation to debate them on Second Stage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The adoption Bill is due this session. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The other Bill is the criminal justice (forensic sampling and evidence) Bill, the purpose of which is to establish a DNA database.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of the Bill have been approved and it is hoped it will be published this session, which is up to 3 July.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>

I understand the heads of the Bill have yet to be agreed by the Government.

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>In resuming the debate on Second Stage of the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2008 I reiterate my support for the provisions in the Lisbon reform treaty aimed at reinforcing the national parliamentary dimension in the European Union.  In recognition of the growing importance of EU legislation and the need to hold the Government accountable for the negotiation of this legislation, the Oireachtas established the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, the central task of which is to act as a watchdog, scrutinising all proposed EU legislation which, on average, amounts to more than 500 documents annually.  It can decide to scrutinise in depth proposed EU legislation which it believes holds significant implications for Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The need to bring citizens closer to the decision making process has also been recognised by the European Commission which decided in 2006 to send all proposed EU legislation directly to the national parliaments at the same time as it is sent to governments and the European Parliament.  The intention is to invite comments from national parliaments on proposals for EU legislation.  The joint committee, through its scrutiny process, can prepare opinions on draft EU legislation.  It, therefore, seeks to play its part in bridging the perceived divide between the citizens and their capacity to influence the EU decision-making process.</P>
        <P>The work of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny comes at a critical time as the country prepares to vote in a referendum to decide on the ratification of the Lisbon reform treaty.  It is important to demonstrate efforts are being made both at national and EU level to listen to the citizens and respond to their concerns regarding the perceived lack of democratic accountability within the EU.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon reform treaty contains several provisions aimed at reinforcing the parliamentary dimension in the EU by extending democratic control over decisions at EU level and ensuring greater transparency in the decision-making process.</P><Col N="321"/>
        <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, I have noted how national parliaments are given expanded powers over proposed new legislation from the Commission.  All EU legislative proposals are properly and thoroughly examined by public representatives before adoption and the interests of all sectors of society are taken into account as part of the scrutiny process.</P>
        <P>When the Lisbon reform treaty is ratified, the role of the Oireachtas and, in turn, the committee on European scrutiny, will be greatly enhanced.  Not only will the committee be able to influence Government decision-making on EU issues but, together with other EU national parliaments, it will be able to directly influence the decisions of the European Commission and the final decision-making process at EU level.</P>
        <P>At present, national parliaments do not have the formal power to contribute their views on proposed EU law.  The Lisbon reform treaty, for the first time, gives a formal role to national parliaments in the EU policy-making process.  Article 8.C recognises that national parliaments contribute actively to the good functioning of the Union.  When ratified, the treaty will allow for the first time national parliaments to be provided for in the main body of an EU treaty.  Up to now, provisions relating to national parliaments existed only in protocols and political declarations.</P>
        <P>The new article is complemented by two protocols annexed to the reform treaty, the protocol on the role of national parliaments and the protocol on the application of subsidiarity and proportionality.  These protocols will allow national parliaments to be better informed and will facilitate them in contributing to EU policy at the earliest stage in the decision-making process.  Most importantly, they lay down an early-warning system which enables national parliaments to review EU legislative proposals, judge whether they are in compliance with subsidiarity &mdash; the decision is being made as close to the citizen as possible &mdash; and forward an opinion to the relevant EU institutions.</P>
        <P>All opinions received from national parliaments will be weighted and counted with each national parliament having two votes.  The Oireachtas will have one vote for the D&aacute;il and one for the Seanad.  If the negative opinions were to represent one third of all votes allocated to national parliaments, the European Commission would have to review its proposal and, subsequently, maintain, amend or withdraw it, giving reasons for its decision.</P>
        <P>If the Commission still wishes to maintain a legislative proposal against opposition of a simple majority of national parliaments, the opinions of the Commission and national parliaments will be referred to the European Parliament and the Council for a final decision on compatibility with subsidiarity.  If they believe that it is not in compliance, the proposal can be rejected either by 55% majority in the Council or a simple majority in the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>Any single national parliament will have the power to veto EU legislation in the field of family law.  There is also a further safeguard whereby those national parliaments which submitted a negative opinion are free to bring an action against the Commission to the European Court of Justice on the grounds of an infringement of the subsidiarity principle.  National parliaments would be represented by their governments in such proceedings.</P>
        <P>This ingenious provision is designed to respond to the demand of EU citizens to make the EU more democratic.  There is no better way to achieve this than by enabling the central institution of any democracy, its national parliament, to play an important role in the decision-making of the EU.  The aim is to ensure decisions taken by the EU and its member governments are taken with the full knowledge and involvement of the citizen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Decisions must be taken as close to the citizen as possible, otherwise the EU institutions will be in breach of the principle of subsidiarity.  According to Article 5 of the reform treaty, the EU shall act in areas where it does not have exclusive competency only if a proposed action <Col N="322"/>cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states but can rather, by reason of the scale or effect of the proposed action, be better achieved at EU level.  This article also tasks national parliaments with ensuring that EU institutions comply with the principle of subsidiarity.</P>
        <P>The committee on European scrutiny intends to take seriously this task of policing the actions of the EU institutions.  It is working to ensure the full implementation of these new provisions by the Oireachtas when the reform treaty comes into force.  The overall aim must be to ensure the EU continues to function as efficiently and democratically as possible for the benefit of all EU citizens.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon reform treaty will contribute to greater democratic control and transparency of the EU decision-making process and help to ensure the EU is acting in the best interests of the citizen.  This, coupled with the new provisions of the treaty on the enhanced role of national parliaments, will hopefully mean that in future eurobarometer surveys, a much larger proportion of us will feel that our opinion counts when the EU takes decisions.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the EU has brought positive and significant economic and social advance to all our citizens.  It has delivered an unprecedented period of national advancement.  Since 1973, policies developed under the EU treaties have helped to transform our country.  Under the Common Agricultural Policy and the Structural Funds, up to &euro;58 billion in funding has flowed into Ireland from the EU budget.  This support has been vital in improving our infrastructure, greatly improving the competitive position of our economy.</P>
        <P>It is no coincidence that Ireland&rsquo;s period of dramatically enhanced prosperity has coincided with the existence of the EU Single Market.  The two great achievements of the EU, the euro and the Single Market, have provided a framework through which Irish business has thrived.</P>
        <P>Our past successes in Europe, however impressive, are not reason enough to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the treaty.  Past gains were not conjured out of thin air, they were built within a European economic environment shaped in large part by the EU treaties.  The Lisbon treaty is for a 21st century Europe and deals with issues central to the future well-being of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The issues at stake in the coming referendum are not abstract ones remote from everyday life.  At heart, they concern the future of our country.  Ireland needs an effective Union to protect our hard-won prosperity.  By ratifying the treaty, we will put ourselves in a position to continue drawing maximum benefit from EU membership in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>Ireland is the strongest economic success story of the European Union and this treaty will allow us to do even better.  Our sense of enthusiasm and self-confidence to identify future opportunities have already taken us through several European referendums.  In each past referendum there was a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and a &ldquo;No&rdquo; option and there were arguments and votes in favour of both.  For every citizen, it must be clear that past confident and optimistic decisions to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; have been proven to be correct, while the doom and gloom forecasts of those voices opposed to EU treaties have been clearly proved wrong.  The reality is every time we have said yes, we have gained and taken a step forward.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of this Bill and wish it speedy passage through the Oireachtas.  The role of national parliaments and the critical role of subsidiarity are pertinent, as up to 500 pieces of legislation coming from the EU will be thoroughly debated through the Houses.  The Government Whip will allow time for some of the issues to be discussed before the committees to be taken in the Parliament and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, for agreeing to this.  Many debates are held in committee but it is important to have them discussed within the Chambers.  It is important we examine Bills being introduced and it is equally important that they be debated in this Chamber.</P><Col N="323"/>
        <P>I look forward to an enthusiastic &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the Lisbon reform treaty referendum.  While on my feet I acknowledge the Taoiseach and wish him well, as I may not get another opportunity to congratulate him on his outstanding achievements, particularly in Europe.  I wish him good health and good luck in his future career.  I have always found him courteous, whether in this Chamber or in the constituency.  I wish him well and acknowledge his outstanding achievements.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When I signed the reform treaty in Lisbon last December together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, it was in the full knowledge that it represented an essential part of the process of moving on for the European Union.  The EU is moving on from a period of reflection and consultation and from a phase of talking about institutional reform to a phase where the Union can fully focus on the work at hand and prepare for the challenges ahead.</P>
        <P>During my entire political career, I have held a strong commitment to the European Union.  My core belief is that Ireland benefits hugely from our membership, not just in financial and economic terms, but in terms of our capacity to look outwards and engage with the world beyond our shores.  As I said last week at the IMI, Europe has allowed the Irish people, as a nation, to define ourselves externally in terms of what we are, rather than what we are not.</P>
        <P>I salute again the decision of our political forebears to apply for membership of the European Communities and to contribute over decades to the evolution of the European Union of today.  I salute too the decisions of the Irish people when consulted from time to time over the past 35 years to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to Europe&rsquo;s development.</P>
        <P>I am saddened that despite the evidence of five decades of Europe and 35 years of our own membership, there are still those who instinctively want our nation to withdraw into its shell; they continue to put forward the same arguments, evoking European monsters hiding under the covers of necessarily detailed treaty language.  They were wrong when they initially opposed our membership in 1972 and they were wrong when they opposed the Single European Act and the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties.  They are wrong still.</P>
        <P>When opening the debate in this House last Wednesday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said it could be argued that Ireland has benefited more dramatically than any other country from EU membership.  I believe that to be correct.  Since we joined the Union, we have made as much, if not more, of the opportunities that membership has afforded us than perhaps any other member state.  This is no zero sum game, however, and we did not seize those opportunities at the expense of any other member state.  That is one of the great attributes of the European Union.</P>
        <P>Our increased prosperity and progress also helps those around us, just as it is in our own interest to have successful European neighbours.  Just as with our past, our futures will be also shared.  A future within an effective, dynamic European Union is in Ireland&rsquo;s best interests.</P>
        <P>We have the privilege of living in one of the most peaceful and prosperous regions of the world.  It was not always that way and there is nothing written in stone saying it will always be.  We have to work continuously to maintain and improve what we have and nobody with any sense believes we could have achieved what we have for our region by acting as individual member states.  It would be foolish to believe we can sustain our shared success by pursuing it individually.</P><Col N="324"/>
        <P>The Union we have today is the fruit of working together for 50 years.  It is also the living tree that will bear the fruit of the next 50 years for the generations coming.  We can and do enjoy the fruit but we must also tend our tree.  That is what the reform which this treaty brings about is designed to do.</P>
        <P>The European Union, which we have developed over 50 years, affects many sectors of our society now.  Its development reflects real changes in our world as the influence of borders wanes in the face of technological and social change.  When I addressed the European Parliament in 2006, I spoke of globalisation, technological change, migration, energy security and terrorism.  I commented that it was not the European Union that dreamed up these challenges but we know, logically and intuitively, that our best hopes of managing them lie with the Union.</P>
        <P>People expect us to deliver on their aspirations and their needs and expect that we, as politicians, will develop and maintain the capacity to do just that.  We are now asking the public to approve a treaty which will ensure the Union can keep pace with change, and in short, that it can continue to meet the needs of our public.</P>
        <P>It is true this treaty does not contain a big ticket issue as others before it did.  There is no Single European Act, no single currency to be launched on this occasion.  Nor, in its structure, is it a thing of beauty.  However, its focus on improving the functioning of the Union, rather than altering radically its area of competence, represents a level of maturity within a Union of 50 years standing.  What we are doing now in Europe is getting our house in order; we are tending our tree.</P>
        <P>I will briefly recap the key elements of the treaty.  The reformed decision making methodology will see greater use of qualified majority voting within the Council, whereby a double majority of population and member states is required with appropriate safeguards.  This is logical and approval of a decision requires the support of a clear majority of the member states representing a clear majority of the people.  However, unanimity will continue to be required for decisions in sensitive policy areas.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I see taxation features in the newspapers again today.  Let me once again spell out the position: the treaty will change absolutely nothing here and decisions on taxation will continue to require the unanimous approval of all member states.  Nothing could be clearer.</P>
        <P>The idea of a common consolidated corporation tax base, or CCCTB, can of course be discussed but I see no prospect of it coming into effect this year, next year or in 30 years.  The reform treaty does nothing to change that.  The CCCTB is something to which I have been consistently opposed.  I have done so since 1992 and it gets easier to do so.  It is a daft idea put forward by people who do not really know what they are talking about.  In my view the idea is unhelpful, unnecessary and unworkable.  Many other member states are coming to the same conclusion, although the topic has not been discussed yet by EU finance ministers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Returning to the treaty, the increased role for the European Parliament, particularly as co-legislator, is welcome and brings greater democracy to the Union.  The European Parliament is a key institution and one to which our media ought to pay greater attention.  Yesterday evening I had the pleasure of welcoming the President of the Parliament, Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering, on his visit to Ireland, and I very much appreciate that he addressed the Seanad this morning.  I thank him for his time and commitment.</P>
        <P>The new role for national parliaments, particularly with regard to the protocol on proportionality and subsidiarity, represents a key measure to move decision-making closer to the citizens.  The operation of the protocol presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the <Col N="325"/>Oireachtas.  It is an important and welcome development, and I am confident the Oireachtas will fulfil its new responsibilities extremely well.</P>
        <P>In addition, this involvement of national parliaments opens the possibility of increasing the public&rsquo;s understanding and awareness of the work of the European Union.  The new posts of President of the European Council and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy are sensible, indeed necessary, responses to the need for greater coherence in the Union&rsquo;s business and its external representation.</P>
        <P>The rotating six-month Presidency has served the Union well and Ireland has a proud record of delivering excellent presidencies.  The privilege afforded to me to serve as President of the European Council in 2004, particularly the honour to welcome what were then called the new member states to full membership in May 2004, is one I will always treasure.  The six-month rotating Presidency continues in a changed form.</P>
        <P>The role of the European Council has grown over the more than ten years that I have been a member.  We now need even better preparation of, and follow up to, meetings to ensure the work of the Council is translated into real benefits for all of our citizens.  Suggestions that the post of European Council President will give its occupant excessive powers are well wide of the mark.  The new President will be appointed by the European Council and be responsible to its members.  The President&rsquo;s powers will derive from decisions of the European Council, which the President will chair.  Decisions will, as always, continue to be taken by the member states.</P>
      
        <P>On the external relations side, it is clear that a single representative of both the Council and Commission is required if the European Union is to be able to punch its weight internationally.  This has led to the creation of the high representative position and the new President of the European Council being given a role with regard to external relations.  However, they can only articulate agreed EU positions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Charter of Fundamental Rights, which reflects the European Union&rsquo;s values and underpins the rights of individuals across the Union, is brought into effect by the treaty.  It is right that the Union has this clear expression of the fundamental rights that are central to the development of so many areas of its work.</P>
        <P>The explicit inclusion within the European Union&rsquo;s competences of climate change, at my initiative, means that confronting one of the world&rsquo;s greatest challenges is now hardwired into the machinery of Europe.  Few issues capture as neatly what we need in Europe or illustrate so compellingly why the Union is looked to the world over as an unparalleled model of international sharing of sovereignty.  As for climate change, there is no doubt that changes are necessary if we are to confront the challenge.  Those changes may not be easy.  However, as we enter a new energy era, there will be a moment of immense opportunity.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is difficult to believe that more than six years have passed since we adopted the Laeken Declaration which could be thought of as the origins of the treaty we are debating.  It committed the European Union to strive to be more democratic, transparent and effective.  The Lisbon treaty delivers on all of this for the Union.  It will be more democratic thanks to increased roles for both the European and national parliaments and the introduction of the citizens&rsquo; initiative.  It will be more transparent on foot of the changes in the way the Council will conduct its business and because the role of national parliaments in scrutinising proposed legislative measures will ensure a greater awareness of them.  The Union will be more efficient as a result of the revised decision-making procedures, the reduction in the number of Commission members &mdash; but with full equality for member states &mdash; and the introduction of the new posts of President of the Council and high representative.</P><Col N="326"/>
        <P>When I signed the treaty on behalf of Ireland, I did so knowing that, as with the earlier constitutional treaty, we had achieved all our key goals during the negotiations.  No country gets everything it wants in negotiations of this nature but we are extremely satisfied with a treaty which enables Europe to function much more effectively and efficiently and which does not adversely affect any of Ireland&rsquo;s key interests.</P>
        <P>We know the world is changing fast and many are intimidated by the feeling of the future rushing towards them.  Globalisation is so real that many are already tiring of it.  Ireland is often referred to as being among the most globalised countries in the world, probably because that is the case.  For hundreds of years &mdash; sadly not for the happiest of reasons &mdash; we have been a highly globalised people.  This has served us well in recent times in ways we could never have anticipated in the light of the unhappy circumstances that gave rise to it.  One salient point to be made about our progress is that our people are no longer obliged to leave the country.  Our membership of the European Union has played a central role in achieving that change, not least by encouraging foreign investment and giving companies assured access to lucrative markets across the Continent.</P>
        <P>The European Union has also been an immense support to the peace process on this island.  It is difficult to imagine that the many positive changes we have witnessed in the past ten years could have come about without the support and encouragement of so many from beyond our shores, as well as those within Ireland, North and South.</P>
        <P>The wisdom of previous generations that resolved to face outwards has its reward in the peace, stability and prosperity we enjoy.  The responsibility to future generations is now ours.  There can be no doubt but that the best way to preserve the progress we have made is to remain actively and positively engaged with Europe and the wider world.  We must continue to go abroad and seek to influence the world which influences us.  We must resist passivity or any sense of fatality about global change.  Instead, we must seek to shape and embrace that change.  We must never turn in on ourselves and become blind to the challenges and opportunities that are evolving all the time.</P>
        <P>For the European Union, the same arguments apply.  As the largest integrated market in the world, with a leading currency, home to many of the world&rsquo;s most successful economies, host to societies with among the best living standards on the planet and as a democratic, stable area of peace and prosperity, Europe simply must play its role in the world.  The European Union is a force for good.  Our values are clear: respect for human dignity; freedom; democracy; equality; the rule of law; and human rights.  If our values do not shape our world and our future, then others will.</P>
        <P>For many years I have represented Ireland and pursued its interests in Europe.  My party and the Governments I have been privileged to lead have worked tirelessly to ensure Ireland reaps the benefits of EU membership, that its voice is heard on the European stage and that the Union is attuned to its interests and needs.  This reflects the desire of the vast majority of Members of the House for a constructive engagement with the Union.</P>
        <P>The negotiation of the reform treaty is the latest chapter of that work and Ireland&rsquo;s national interests were well protected therein.  We must now ensure the European Union is equipped for the future.  We need the Union to continue to play its role, both within its borders and on the global stage.  That is what the treaty sets out to do and what it does very well.  That is why it is vital that the House adopt the Bill which gives effect to the referendum on the reform treaty.  Above all, that is why it is vital not just that there be a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 12 June but that it be a resounding and confident &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P><Col N="327"/>
        <P>I wish colleagues on all sides who are involved in the campaign well.  The only advice I can give is that nothing should be taken for granted.  It is in the interests of the country and the coming generations that we work hard to ensure there will be a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  The latter will strengthen our position in Europe and at the European Council and various Ministerial Councils.  The fact that, unlike all other member states, Ireland will have a democratic mandate, will strengthen our position immeasurably.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Lisbon treaty, the origins of which lie in the Convention on the Future of Europe.  Recommendations were made in respect of introducing the treaty following wide consultation by the convention.  The treaty consolidates existing treaties and streamlines decision making, makes Europe more efficient and ensures the development of the Union will continue in as efficient a manner as possible.</P>
        <P>We support the treaty but cannot be complacent with regard to its being passed by the people, particularly in the light of the fact that it is complex and detailed.  Great effort must be invested in explaining the various sections of the treaty and the issues that arise to as many as possible.  We must use the media as widely as possible in order to ensure the contents of the treaty and its objectives and benefits will be fully understood.</P>
        <P>Ireland continues to support the European Union.  A recent study shows that 74% of Irish people continue to support the Union and that 87% accept that we have benefited from our membership of it.  However, 60% are of the opinion that Ireland&rsquo;s voice is not heard in Europe.  There is a deficit in communicating the issues and developments involved and also in highlighting the role and opportunity Ireland will have in shaping the development of the treaty and the decisions taken in all areas.  We face a challenge, therefore, in ensuring the people are made aware of what is involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ten or perhaps 20 years ago there were those who began to comment that there was a need to communicate with the people on what happened in the European Union and the benefits of membership thereof.  Both the national parliament and the political system in general have failed to communicate this message to the public.  However, some of the blame for this failure must be placed on the Union and its systems.  In the next two months we will have an opportunity to debate the various issues involved.  We have a duty to inform the people with regard to that in respect of which they are being asked to vote.  We must ensure the treaty is passed in order to bring about a more effective and efficient Union and to allow it to develop in order that it might benefit all its citizens.  We have had various communications with regard to criticisms of the treaty and the campaign to defeat it.  Although we fully accept the right of people to campaign and express their views on the matter, some have introduced red herrings into the debate, which often cause confusion.  I also experienced this in debates on the Maastricht treaty referendum.  I want to deal with some of these red herrings on which we have received information.  Oireachtas Members have received documentation from several groups and individuals on the reasons we should vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach said, the treaty does not bring tax policy within the powers of the European Union.  The treaty clarifies the areas in which the Union can legislate and tax is not one of them.  The suggestion that Ireland will not retain control of its own tax policy and tax rates under the treaty is a red herring.  Under the new treaty, we will retain our veto on an EU-wide tax.  There is no reference in the treaty to a common tax policy.  Those who campaign based on the prospect of our losing taxation powers are misleading the public by alleging that the reform <Col N="328"/>treaty will undermine our corporate tax rate of 12.5%.  We will retain all our powers and discretion in taxation policy.</P>
        <P>The treaty will not create a super-state, as has been claimed.  It safeguards the sovereignty of Ireland and other EU countries.  The &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners claim that the treaty is a grab for power by Brussels at the expense of the individual member states, including Ireland.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  The treaty sets out for the first time the European Union&rsquo;s exact responsibilities and its limits in these areas.  It outlines the parameters of the Union&rsquo;s influence and decision making powers.  There will be a clear division of powers in decision making and the influence of the Union over its members.</P>
        <P>Ireland is being consulted on the referendum and will continue to be consulted on changes in EU treaties.  Those who say the treaty is self-amending and that this may be the last opportunity for the people to vote on an EU treaty are misleading.  Ireland must, by virtue of the Constitution, consult the people by means of a referendum when ratifying any future treaty.  The reform treaty does not fetter this obligation in any way.  It provides for a simplified amending process for future treaties but no major changes can take place without a referendum such as the one being debated.</P>
        <P>Some have said the treaty may lead to additional immigration.  Ireland, when signing up to the Treaty of Rome in 1973, agreed to the free movement of workers, a principle which is a cornerstone of the European Union.  It has allowed Irish people to live and work all over Europe and provided us with Latvian, German, Polish, French and other workers.  This has been good for Irish people and the economy.  The growth we have experienced in the past ten years would not have taken place without the contribution of the wider European family.  The reform treaty adds absolutely nothing new with regard to the ability of Europeans to emigrate to Ireland.  Not one additional immigrant will enter this country if we accept the treaty.</P>
        <P>If the treaty is passed, will it cost Ireland money?  We have received billions of euro from Brussels during the years and have enjoyed an astonishing rate of economic development thanks to our membership.  We will in future receive less in EU Cohesion Funds than we have previously, simply because the aid we received has been successfully used by Irish people to expand the economy.  Membership of the European Union continues to provide us with huge financial benefits.  It is not just about direct payments or the contribution to the national development plan.  The biggest financial gains have been indirect.  For example, the opportunities provided by the internal market have given us and will continue to give us more than we have ever received in direct funds.  With the extension of the Union, growth in the economies of the new member states will provide further opportunities for Irish companies to access these markets and sell our goods.</P>
        <P>The previously rejected extension of the EU constitution has been discussed.  We are told that the Lisbon treaty is the European constitution in another name and that a con-job is being perpetrated on the people by calling it the Lisbon treaty rather than the European constitution.  The treaty is similar to the European constitution, but the elements that made that document a constitution rather than a treaty, including elements with which certain member states were uncomfortable, such as giving status to the EU flag, have been removed.  We should vote on the substantive issues, not on the basis of words such as &ldquo;treaty&rdquo; and &ldquo;constitution&rdquo;.  The European Union as a project is unprecedented and labels such as these do not do justice to the unique institutional arrangements put in place by the current 27 countries.</P>
        <P>As other countries are not holding a referendum, it has been suggested we should use the opportunity to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to give these other countries a chance to have their say.  That is one of the theories being peddled.  We have our own Constitution that dictates that we must hold <Col N="329"/>a referendum.  No other European country has dictated to us that we should not hold a referendum or told us how to manage our affairs; therefore, why should we tell other sovereign nations how they should go about ratifying a treaty, whether it be an EU treaty or any other international treaty?  How other countries decide whether they should sign up for the treaty cannot be dictated by Brussels or any other member state, including Ireland.  This is basic international law and also common sense.  It would be a dangerous precedent for us to try to dictate to other countries by insisting that they hold referendums.  In fact, referendums are unconstitutional in some EU countries such as Germany where they were banned after being abused by Hitler in the 1930s.</P>
        <P>It has also been suggested the treaty presents a threat to the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.  However, it will have little impact on it except in one way, which is positive.  For the first time the directly elected European Parliament as well as the  Agriculture and Fisheries Council will vote on issues relating to agriculture.  This will be of major benefit to our farmers as their MEPs will have a direct say.  For the first time farmers will be in a position to lobby and influence MEPs, rather than just the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, on matters of agricultural policy.  Under the treaty, Fine Gael will be in a position to have five MEPs influencing the direction of EU agricultural policy.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P Just="Left">We are told that the treaty could be a back door to the introduction of abortion and stem cell research, but the opposite is the case.  For the first time the competences of the European Union are set out in the treaty.  Health policy is strictly deemed to be a competence of each member state, not a responsibility of the Union.  Therefore, abortion and such issues are clearly recognised as not being within the scope of the Union.  Our own social and moral beliefs are afforded greater protection by the treaty than by any previous one.</P>
        <P>We have seen posters of Deputy Creighton throughout the city implying that the treaty will force Ireland to join a European army, but this is absolutely not the case.  The new arrangements for co-operation in the areas of security and defence fully respect the neutral position of Ireland and other member states.  Ireland will not be subject to a mutual defence clause.  European military activity is directed at peacekeeping and crisis intervention.  Participation is the option of each member state and not obligatory.  Since the 1950s we have been lauded throughout the world for our work with the United Nations.  While we have and will continue to participate in peacekeeping missions, it will be on a case by case basis, subject to the triple lock principle, requiring the support of the Government, the Oireachtas and a United Nations mandate.  Without these three criteria, the Army will not participate in any peacekeeping or crisis intervention duties.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners have been forecasting the end of Irish neutrality for 36 years but they have always been wrong and still are on this occasion.  There is a view that we should vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to punish the Government&rsquo;s poor level of performance.  We agree that the Government has not performed well but we disagree with using a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote to punish it in this respect.  We are extremely concerned by the performance of the health service, about our inadequate education system, the mismanagement of the economy and crime.  Coming from Limerick, I am very concerned about that issue, as are people from the mid-west and elsewhere.  However, the people must not use these matters as excuses to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; and punish the Government.  That chance will come at the local and European elections next year.  At that time they will be able to judge the Government&rsquo;s policies, but to do so now would damage the country&rsquo;s future role and influence in Europe.  It would be the wrong thing to do.  I will campaign actively in my area to ensure a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  We are having the first public meeting on this matter in Adare, in my constituency, on 21 April.  The leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, will address the meeting.</P><Col N="330"/>
        <P>Membership of the European Union has been good for Ireland and played a role in creating 1 million extra jobs since 1973.  In addition, Ireland has received &euro;58 billion in transfer payments since joining the Union.  All Irish citizens enjoy the right to move, work and reside freely in other member states.  The introduction of the euro has made travel within the Union much more convenient and cost effective.  I could never understand why people said its introduction would entail giving up some of our sovereignty.  The punt was based on the pound sterling and, although exchange rates changed, we have more economic and psychological independence within the eurozone than we would have had by remaining with the punt.</P>
        <P>Some 960 foreign companies employing 138,000 workers have set up in Ireland since 1973.  We enjoy free health cover when we travel to any other EU country and Irish is now an official language of the European Union.  Average wages have increased from 60% of the EU average in 1973 to 138% of the average today.  That figure can be questioned, however, because it is calculated by including the new member states.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Investment by US companies in Ireland exceeds combined US investment in China, India, Russia and Brazil.  Part of the attraction for US companies to locate here is the fact that we are in the European Union.  Since joining, over 500 km of motorway have been constructed.</P>

        <P>This referendum is ample testament to the courage and dignity of the Taoiseach in his leadership of the country and Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is a benchmark of the singular importance of the referendum that he chose to put aside his own position and sacrifice himself politically in order that the referendum might be passed and that our national interests would be correctly served by a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  It is also a testament to the importance of the referendum and the treaty that the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote for which I am calling is being echoed by the three major parties &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  These three major parties command the hearts, minds and loyalties of the people when they go to the ballot box.  It is important to note that these three major parties, which the electorate supported demonstrably in the recent election, are behind the treaty.</P>
        <P>It is important to present the facts about the treaty in a balanced way.  It is an innocuous but necessary administrative response to a number of issues affecting the European Union.  The public should put aside any lingering scepticism it might entertain with regard to the treaty.  Some might feel it is an opportunity to knock the Government and I am glad that Deputy Neville dealt with this point in such a direct manner.  The public should carefully calculate our national interests which have been well served by being part of the European Union within which we have enjoyed the most spectacular transition.  It is no exaggeration to say Ireland is the model concerning EU membership.  Many of the applicant states which are anxious to join the Union and share in that prosperity self-consciously try to steer themselves along the Irish model.</P>
        <P>The public should recall that the treaty does not operate in isolation.  There are compelling reasons for voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, particularly the uncertain financial backdrop to the vote.  The world <Col N="331"/>is a much more uncertain place than it was when the people cast their votes at the last general election.  There has been a major crisis in the international financial system and the global economy, occasioned by a US problem &mdash; the sub-prime lending in which some American financial institutions were engaged.  It is not a particularly European problem but a US one that has spread, not unnaturally, to the heart of the international financial system.  This uncertainty demands that people be cautious with regard to issues affecting the European Union, particularly voting in referenda.  I am not trying to scaremonger but I am merely pointing out that there are causes and consequences when people choose to reject treaties such as this.  The world is far more globalised and interconnected today than it was ten years ago.  Rejecting this treaty would send a message of uncertainty and instability to a world that is already unstable due to problems in sub-prime lending.</P>
        <P>The problem of sub-prime lending originated predominately in the United States.  It should not be forgotten that that nation accounts for 35% of the world&rsquo;s wealth: it is a 35% stakeholder in the world economy which means it has enormous influence.  Europe must carefully watch what happens in the United States with regard to this issue.  Thankfully, European and Irish banks have been substantially unaffected by the sub-prime crisis.  We must be fair to Irish banks because, while it is often popular to criticise them, they have been responsible lenders at a time of unprecedented success for the economy.  The sub-prime crisis has not revealed irresponsible lending practices at the heart of our banking system which is a tribute to those working in it.</P>
        <P>There has been sluggish growth in the European economy in recent years but it is not teetering on the edge of recession, like the US economy.  This is down to a set of reasons that relate to the dependence of the US economy on consumer confidence and domestic consumption.  The US economy and US consumers depend heavily on investments in the stock markets and equities but that is not the case in the eurozone.  For all of these reasons the euro currency offers a haven of stability in an unsettled global currency market that has seen sharp depreciation of the dollar.  It is not an exaggeration to say that in its short existence the euro has established itself as a credible reserve currency.  It does not rival the dollar yet but an interesting international academic study of the status of the euro as a reserve currency has concluded that in the next ten to 15 years it is possible that it could replace the dollar as a reserve currency.  That is a significant destiny for the European Union and those who manage the euro in the European Central Bank.  There is a huge responsibility on those who manage the affairs of Europe.</P>
        <P>The European Union is the largest and richest economic bloc in the world.  It is an economic powerhouse but diplomatically and politically does not rival the United States on the world stage.  It is often depicted internationally as somewhat incoherent in terms of its diplomatic and political voice in world affairs.  I passionately believe in world development and believe it would be catastrophic if we chose not to reform the institutions of the Union and how they are run in executive and administrative terms.  If we do not reform the institutions and instead leave things as they are, there is enormous potential for bureaucratic and political inertia and, as it is said in the United States, gridlock in the political and executive system.  If this gridlock and political inertia at the heart of Brussels, the administrative capital of the richest bloc in the world, were to coincide with a period of deep financial instability and speculation on international currency exchanges, there could be catastrophic effects.  This would not only affect Irish prosperity and living standards but the entire European continent and the wider world.  This is a serious responsibility for a bloc such as the European Union to hold in its hands and it behoves European leaders to put to the forefront the issue of the reform of institutions to make them more transparent and accountable.  The treaty does this.</P>
        <P>The treaty will provide a voting system and administrative arrangements that will enhance the decision making process.  Simultaneously, it carries the necessary changes and adaptations that will allow for democratic accountability, which is important.</P><Col N="332"/>
        <P Just="Left">Our vital national interests are protected in the treaty and there is no question of our arrangements on abortion, defence and taxes being affected.  It is a modest treaty, the substance of which was negotiated by the Taoiseach in 2004, when we held the Presidency of the European Union.  I hope that, when it is passed in Ireland and ratified across the continent, European leaders will pause to consider who should chair the proceedings of the European Council.  I hope they turn to the Taoiseach, as I believe he would be an ideal man to provide the leadership required in Europe.  The meetings of the European Council which are sometimes boring, incoherent or indeterminate in their conclusions and recommendations must be chaired and steered.  We need strength at that table, as the proceedings need to be steered well.</P>

	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important issue.</P>
        <P>Europe, including Ireland, cannot stand still, nor can we act alone.  The world is becoming ever more interconnected and we need to exploit that interconnectedness to address new and emerging challenges, including globalisation, demographic shifts, climate change, the need for new sustainable energy sources and labour mobility.  These are the issues facing Europe in the 21st century.  Borders are meaningless in the face of such challenges and EU member states cannot meet them alone but, acting together, Europe can deliver results and respond to the concerns of its people.  The expansion of the European Union from 15 to 27 member states in a relatively short period of time means new and innovative methods for co-operating and acting more effectively are required to allow it respond to the rapid changes in the world.  This means adjusting and modifying our policies and rethinking some of the ground rules for working together.  The Lisbon reform treaty provides the proper framework to undertake these tasks.  Ireland has been a huge beneficiary of EU integration and enlargement and the European Union continues to be crucial to our future well-being and prosperity.  That is why a more effective Union is in Ireland&rsquo;s best interests and why ratification of the treaty is so important.</P>
        <P>Across Europe there is a consensus on the need to create a market for innovation and innovative ideas.  The challenge for Europe is that competition for human resources in science and technology is now global.  Europe is in direct competition with other major trading blocs for the best research resources.  Researchers, for example, are moving more rapidly.  We need to find ways to address these challenges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Access to EU Structural Funds and participation in the European Union&rsquo;s research and development programmes, for example, have done much to enable researchers in Ireland to access funds, collaborate with European partners in cutting-edge research, develop a national system of innovation and upgrade national science and technology infrastructure.  EU supports have been used, alongside steadily increasing national supports, to lay the foundations for a knowledge-based economy.  There is a high degree of complementarity between Ireland&rsquo;s objectives in science, technology and innovation and wider European objectives in this area.  The renewed focus on the Lisbon agenda and the emphasis placed on strengthening the European research area coincide with the implementation of the most comprehensive plan for investment in science, technology and innovation that has ever taken place in Ireland.  A key element of the strategy for science, technology and innovation, 2006-13, relates to Ireland&rsquo;s interaction with the rest of Europe and the world.  The strategy provides us with a distinct opportunity to ensure maximum economic and social benefits are derived from the Government&rsquo;s commitment of &euro;8.2 billion to this area under the national development plan.  Activities at a European level will contribute directly to the achievement of the objectives set out in the strategy.  Irish researchers and enterprises participate actively in the EU Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, a large multi-annual research programme that complements <Col N="333"/>national funding for research and development.  The framework programme supports research across a range of subject areas, for example, ICT, life sciences, nanotechnology, food and agriculture, social sciences and humanities, all of which are important priority areas for Ireland in terms of economic and social development.  The framework programme provides funding to academic researchers, large enterprises and SMEs in Ireland to engage in collaborative research partnerships with their peers throughout the EU and beyond.  It also provides financial support through the &ldquo;Marie Curie Actions&rdquo; to encourage the mobility of researchers across Europe and to encourage researchers to move between the worlds of academia and industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In overall terms, researchers and enterprises in Ireland received approximately &euro;210 million of research funding from the Sixth Framework Programme, FP6, the largest monetary sum received to date from the framework programme.  Funding provided under previous rounds of the framework programme, going back to the early 1980s, was a key element in building up the research capacity that is in place in the country today.  The programme is also directly linked with the emergence of some key Irish start-up enterprises that have progressed to become important global players in a number of industry sectors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our experience of participation in the framework programmes and the European Space Agency has been very useful in this regard in helping us to build communities of researchers across industry, in academia and internationally.  The European framework programmes have always been an important element in the internationalisation of Irish research.  They have enabled academic and industry research groups to work with peers across Europe and derive the benefits associated with collaborative research, for example, access to knowledge networks, access to specialist equipment, sharing of costs and risks and, in particular for industry, the possibility of opening commercial opportunities.</P>
        <P>In 2007, the European Commission launched the Seventh EU Framework Programme, FP7, with a budget of &euro;50 billion to cover the period 2007-13.  In scale and scope, FP7 is the most ambitious of the framework programmes to date.  Irish researchers and enterprises will continue to participate actively in the collaborative research and mobility sub-programmes of FP7.  In addition, there are new elements in FP7 such as industry-led joint technology initiatives, JTIs, and the European Research Council, ERC, to reward excellence in frontier research.</P>
        <P>FP7 will be a key element of the European research landscape that will help Irish researchers and enterprises to achieve the targets set out in the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation.  In funding terms alone, it is expected that FP7 will inject some &euro;600 million of additional research funding into the national RTD system.  The importance of science, research and development, innovation, skills and training policies and better regulation are paramount.  The road to meeting the wider environmental challenges of climate change and energy as well as the trade and development issues have most chance of success if managed collaboratively with our EU partners.</P>
        <P>Ireland supports openness and free trade.  Our whole approach to globalisation is clearly linked to the improving competitiveness of the EU.  This momentum must be maintained.  The unambiguous connection between embracing globalisation and competitiveness, through national and EU programmes, must be maintained.  The Lisbon reform treaty will provide the necessary cohesion to improve and drive our competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Skills, human resources and creativity are the mainstay of our competitiveness.  Increasingly, mobile investment is seeking skills as well as lower costs.  We cannot always compete on cost but we can compete on the strength of our knowledge base, skills innovation, networking capabilities and flexibility.  For Ireland in the 21st century, competitiveness will depend on merging these attributes with a flair and commitment to innovation that is unmatched in the markets in which we compete.</P><Col N="334"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">Collaboration &mdash; among employees, between firms and in the form of alliances with technology institutes and universities &mdash; increases our innovation performance.  Mutual economic benefits can be derived from knowledge-sharing and mentoring programmes between successful large companies and SMEs.  Increasingly, it will also involve coalitions that cross national boundaries, building on the transnational programmes promoted by the EU and our other international partners.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Implementing the Single European Market has opened all sorts of product and service markets to competition and provided a stimulus to innovation.  It enables resources to flow more effectively to sectors, regions and these markets, to provide the best returns and improve Europe&rsquo;s competitiveness.  For example the development of business clusters and networks and transnational co-operation can be a potent force in strengthening their growth.  Transnational co-operation between clusters can act as bridge builders across Europe&rsquo;s regions.  By connecting clusters through EU programmes and our other international partners, new business and research contacts are made and fostered, allowing cross-border knowledge flows and innovation.  This cross-border activity can improve labour mobility and stimulate new opportunities for innovators and entrepreneurs and provide international expertise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of recent initiatives by the EU Commission are to become drivers of the EU innovation strategy.  We are particularly supportive of creating the proper conditions and framework for intensive collaboration, partnership and clustering among companies and sectors.  We are actively seeking to develop this at national level, including through some relatively new programmes such as an industry-led research network scheme operated by Enterprise Ireland and the CSETs programme of Science Foundation Ireland.</P>
        <P>As new models of economic activity emerge in a globalised market place, new thinking is also required on services innovation if policy and supports favouring services innovation are to be matched to the new models.  In the light of the growing recognition of the need for more environmentally friendly products, processes and services, and the future importance of environmental conservation to the global economy, there also appears to be significant growth opportunities within the global market for indigenous industry in this sector and, potentially, for foreign direct investment.  Innovation will be a key element in exploiting such opportunities.</P>
        <P>The EU has played a critical role in the formation of our successful and vibrant economy.  Yet, the benefits of EU membership go far beyond financial transfers.  Almost no aspect of our public life has been untouched.  The European Union has contributed to the modernisation of the Irish economy and society and the Union, under the Lisbon reform treaty, will continue to be a modernising influence in our move towards a knowledge economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the important aspects of this debate is that we respect different views and different perspectives.  It is important to say at the outset that it is possible to disagree fundamentally with most of what the Minister of State has just said and still be in favour of ratification of the Lisbon reform treaty.  I do so because I profoundly disagree with what he has said.  The question put to a person like myself is what should a person of the left do.  I believe the answer is that they should be in favour of a critical yes.  I believe so, because what is needed, if one is to consider what we have just heard, is a plurality of discourses.  What do I mean by that?  The old ignorant view that the mere liberal model is the only model of economic transfer or economic change in global terms is just that, it is sometimes ignorance, it is sometimes an ideologically driven right wing view, but it is nonsense.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>At present, all over the world, where people are debating their futures, be it in terms of security, food, access to water, rights to education, a balanced relationship between genders, men and women, between young children, between the rights of female children and male children, in every case where there has been political advance, there has been a debate about <Col N="335"/>how these needs can be met and which path of development is to be chosen.  In every continent at present there are massive movements that oppose what are regarded as the successors to the failure of the Doha round in regard to trade.  Thus, there are popular movements in Sub-Saharan Africa opposing trade agreements that might be imposed by the European Union.  There are movements against free trade agreements that have been developed all over Latin America.  In Asia, there are different groups, for example, South Korean workers striking against imposed conditions.</P>
        <P>Let us be clear that one should be for the Lisbon treaty because one is insisting on a space and a discourse that will give us a real debate about economics, a real debate about trade and a real debate about Europe in the world.  It is not helped by those who suggest globalisation is a neutral process.  That is nonsense.  I do not deny globalisation but it depends on which process about which one is speaking.  Is it the globalisation that takes responsibility for climate change, energy production, human dignity and human rights?  One is entitled to call that a globalisation of concern.  My party, of which I have the honour of being president, which was founded by James Connolly and which has always been an internationalist one, stresses solidarity and the need to protect the rights of workers wherever they are.  One of my crucial decisions in recommending that my supporters and those of the Labour Party vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is immensely important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us consider those opposing the treaty such as those in the Ganley camp.  They believe we should not have regulation, that we should have deregulation.  To some extent, in the tailspin of such people are those who make the case for competitiveness without cohesion.  There was a degree of agreement on the Lisbon accord in debating the future of Europe.  There were two pillars: cohesion and competitiveness.  One was not to be advanced at the cost of the other.  We have just heard the superficial version, that we must become a competitive trading block in order to enter the world marketplace and reduce our costs.  No doubt, the next phrase which we did not hear would have been about labour market control and the liberalisation of labour flows.</P>
        <P>I have been around a long time.  Such matters should and will be opposed by the trade union movement all over the world.  They should also be opposed here.  I will cite an example in the medical area.  If one imposes a business model, as the HSE is doing, that workers must be let go in order for it to function within the budget allocated, the question that immediately arises is whether there is no floor below which citizens enjoying medical rights will be allowed to fall.  The argument from the HSE&rsquo;s business model and the 1% Progressive Democrats section of the Cabinet is that one must drive it on, irrespective.  That is nonsense and can be debated in Europe and defeated after a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  It is important to do so.  The Mandelson plan to effectively use Europe as a trading block, driven on through free trade agreements with different parts of the changing world, is just that &mdash; nonsense.</P>
        <P>The other side of the coin which I do not find amusing, as an academic, is the sheer illiteracy of the economics.  As a democrat, I am used to being in a minority.  I believe in a particular kind of economy of the planet, the country in which I live and the people I represent.  Others have a different view.  Christian Democrats, for example, refer to competitiveness more than cohesion.  Populists, like the Cabinet, talk about whatever is fashionable at the moment.  We hear ideologically free phrases such as &ldquo;the figures don&rsquo;t stack up&rdquo; and &ldquo;the fundamentals are sound&rdquo;.  People used to say that about horses that had wind.  The reality is that it is not economics and it is not serious.  I do not present that as intellectual elitism, I say it is necessary to do the work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is wrong to construct an argument about aspects of previous treaties which are not contained in this one, as many opponents are doing.  That is nonsense.   It is equally important to <Col N="336"/>ask a fundamental question: what are the consequences of voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  If one votes &ldquo;No&rdquo;, is a better treaty available?  There is not.  Will voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; reverse decisions and principles decided in previous treaties?  It will not.  One may vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; not because one loves the treaty but because one wishes to participate vigorously to create the Europe that all of us want.  That Europe must have a debate on a social model of the economy that allows, for example, trade unions which have been talking recently.  If the inflation rate moves beyond what has been agreed in respect of wage rises for ordinary workers, what non-wage benefits will the trade unions seek?  Will there be more holidays, a shorter working day or year, changed working conditions or State child care services?  That is the agenda for the trade unions here, in Europe and all over the world.  The social model of the economy is different from the illiterate notions, some of which are similar to saying the moon is out, that there is a global market and a single model in which we will participate.  I can go through these arguments on another occasion such as the idea that &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; is a word we use loosely.  There is such a thing as creativity in society.  Creative societies create knowledge economy spaces within which one has innovation but one does not get it from populist ignorance substituting for economics.</P>
        <P>It is about time we had such serious debates about the kind of Europe the Labour Party decided to support at its conference when it decided to support the Lisbon treaty because of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the values we espouse of solidarity with working people and the right to enjoy a climate with sustainability.  Many of the issues are genuinely global if we are to respond to them.  We will do so but within a model that we will debate in Europe.  That is why we chose these values, not just solidarity but equality, rights, justice, peace and recognition of the value of work in all its aspects.</P>
        <P>I noticed something that was missing from many speeches.  If one accepts the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is possible to drive the rights perspective on into international bodies.  Therefore, Europe could become a champion for rights.  Contrast that prospect for the future of Europe with the Mandelson doctrine.  We are not having a treaty that is about a market only.  It is about changed administrative and institutional decision making arrangements in a larger European Union that includes social and political issues much more than it includes market issues.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that Poul Nyrup Rasmussen in writing his report for the Party of European Socialists, &ldquo;Europe and a New Global Order&rdquo;, states:</P>
        <P LI="1">We need global progressive alliances for change. Such alliances will have to bring progressive political forces together around shared political aims. They will go beyond the borders of social democracy and include progressive civil society organisations, NGOs, trade unions and businesses devoted to building a sustainable world of democracy, peace, security and social justice.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0">Let us think about how positive this is, what an invitation to a new discourse this represents in conditions of global change, compared to the notion that we will have an immiserated extension of what we have and a good attempt at imposing it around the world, that we will not understand what we are doing but we are told that there is an opportunity to sell something.  We will have a debate after the referendum.  A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote makes it possible for us to change the direction of Europe and defeat the Mandelson reductionist position and replace it with something that comes from the European tradition &mdash; a respect for intellectual life, values based on genuine humanity, respect for discourse, respect for diversity, respect for different models and hundreds of years of economic theory from Adam Smith through Marshall to Keynes that realised that the entire purpose of economic proposals was to serve a moral and social purpose.  If we are living what I am saying, the case <Col N="337"/>for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote need not be made in the context of illiteracy.  It can be made from a standpoint of principle by social democrats and socialists who are anxious to develop a Europe that many future generations will respect as one that gave them a better prospect of intergenerational justice.</P><P Just="Left">Cuireadh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar athl&oacute;.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Cluster Munitions Bill 2008, which we published some weeks ago.  We started work on it in the latter half of last year, motivated by international events and, admittedly, the work being done by the Government in the sector.  We are conscious that a conference will take place in Croke Park in May and we believe it would strengthen our hand as one of the nations seeking to take a lead on this issue to have this legislation in place.  The Minister will table an amendment to the Bill.  While I agree with some aspects of the amendment, I disagree with others.  When the Minister rises to speak at 7.40 p.m., I hope he will see it in his heart to accept the Bill as is.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have reviewed previous attempts to introduce Private Members&rsquo; legislation, namely, the landmines Bill, and noted the comments of some Members on the Government side of the House.  I trust the Minister will not stand and call the Bill flawed or inappropriate, as occurs often.  I recall the phrase &ldquo;scribbled on the back of a cigarette box&rdquo;, but this Bill has not been scribbled on the back of a cigarette box.  Rather, it is well considered and unique, the first of its kind.  If the Government or our colleagues in the Labour Party want some aspects addressed, there is Committee Stage on which to do so.  In recent years, that Stage has been flexible in respect of much legislation.  I hope the Minister will accept the Bill.</P>
        <P>Cluster munitions are possibly the most reprehensible weapon that can be used in conflict.  Their main purpose is to inflict terror in the civilian population.  They do not discriminate between soldier or civilian, mother or son, child or adult.  The evidence of their work is clearly visible in several areas of the world, from Lebanon to Vietnam and Kosovo to Chad, as one witnesses the young child on crutches or the adult minus an arm.  Long after the conflict is over, the local population can suffer from the horror of cluster munitions because the non-threatening design can arouse curiosity in the unsuspecting civilian.  In the late 1970s, an unexploded mortar shell killed several children in the Glen of Imaal in County Wicklow.  They played with the lethal weapon innocently, having found it in the range area.</P>
        <P>Some cluster munitions are designed to explode long after initial contact.  Even some of those that are designed to explode on impact can be faulty and explode at a later time, particularly on contact.  Often, this contact is made by an innocent civilian or child.  It is estimated that the <Col N="338"/>Israel-Lebanon conflict in 2006 resulted in more than 1 million unexploded bomblets being deposited in the towns and hillsides of Lebanon.  In Afghanistan, the humanitarian ration packs dropped from aircraft were difficult to distinguish from cluster bomblets, with both displaying a similar colour coding.  To this day, several hundred people die in Vietnam each year from the remnants of war.</P>
        <P>The first cluster bombs used were of German manufacture and were dropped during the Second World War.  The design was elaborated upon by the Americans, Russians, Italians and others.  Today, more than 30 countries produce cluster munitions and more than 20 countries use them.  In the 1960s, the US used cluster bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos and the French used them in Chad.  From 1994 to 1996, the Russians used them in Chechnya.  From 1995 to 2000, the Sudanese Government used them internally against local rebel forces.  As recently as 1999, the US, Britain and the Netherlands used them in Kosovo.</P>
        <P>The footprint of a single cluster bomb can be as large as a football pitch.  The fragments of exploding submunitions travel at high velocity.  If even the smallest fragment impacts on an individual, it initiates wave pressures within the body that do horrific damage to soft tissue and organs.  A single fragment can kill or leave one blind or without a limb.  I served in Lebanon in the mid-1980s.  Something that struck me when I arrived there was the number of young children with one leg, no legs, one arm or no arms.  Most of those injuries were caused by bomblets whereas some were caused by a method to stun fish using grenades, which can be a dangerous occupation.  To see the situation at first hand can leave an indelible impact on an individual.</P>
        <P>After the Kosovo conflict in 1999, efforts were made to handle the mine problem in that region.  According to the UN Mine Action Co-ordination Centre in Pristina, the total number of mines and unexploded ordnance cleared by March 2001 was more than 84,000.</P>
        <P>Research has shown that the majority of victims are poor, uneducated males at work, comprising approximately 77% of the total confirmed casualties.  Many of them are boys under the age of 18 years.  In southern Lebanon, almost 90% of the land used for farming and grazing is contaminated with unexploded cluster submunitions.  Some 98% of cluster munition casualties are civilians killed and injured while returning home in the aftermath of conflict or while going about their working days.  Could we imagine being out for a picnic on a weekend in Ireland when, after our children run after a football they have kicked over a fence, we hear an explosion?  This is what occurs in the countries in question.</P>
        <P>While research in this area is difficult, it is evident that, for 400 million people living in affected countries, cluster munitions turn homes and communities into <i>de facto</i> mine fields.  In Kosovo, 53% of casualties occurred in the two months after the end of the conflict.  Most of the victims, those killed and maimed, were boys between five years and 15 years of age.  Almost 200 people have been killed or maimed since the war in southern Lebanon ended in 2006.  In Vietnam, 300 people are still being killed each year.</P>
        <P>In 2000, the BBC reported that the bright yellow American cluster bombs, whether by accident or design, were visually appealing to children who found them.  In May 1995, the Croatian capital, Zagreb, was deliberately targeted by Serb forces.  One Serb general informed the press that, if the Croats launched an offensive, the Serbs would attack &ldquo;weak points&rdquo;.  He went on to state: &ldquo;We know who the people in the parks are &mdash; civilians&rdquo;.  They were targets for cluster bombs.  During the Israel-Lebanon conflict in 2006, Hizbollah used cluster bombs when attacking Israel and the Israelis did likewise.</P>
        <P>The civil war in Laos ended in 1975 officially.  In the opening address at the Wellington Conference on Cluster Munitions in February of this year, Ms Hilde Johnson, deputy executive director of UNICEF, stated:</P><Col N="339"/>
        <P LI="1">On January 17, nine children in southern Laos were searching for little crabs to eat.  The children found a BLU 26 cluster bomb, which exploded.  Three boys from nine to 14 years old died immediately, and a fourth 12 year old boy died on the way to the provincial hospital.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is against this background that Fine Gael moves this Bill.</P>
        <P>International efforts have commenced to ban these munitions.  Under the Oslo process, which was launched in Norway in February 2007, approximately 46 countries committed to negotiate by the end of 2008 a ban on using, making, stocking or transferring cluster munitions that cause &ldquo;unacceptable harm to civilians&rdquo;.  Since then, many countries have taken unilateral steps to demonstrate their bona fides and give an added momentum to the process.  The Bill seeks to improve our bona fides and to add momentum by putting Ireland in a position of strength next month.</P>
        <P>In March 2007, Britain stated it would stop using two kinds of &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; cluster munitions that lack self-destruct devices.  The United States is not a part of the Cluster Munitions Coalition.  However, it has signalled some movement on the issue, albeit slowly.  Both the United States House of Representatives and Senate passed the 2008 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, which includes a provision limiting the sale and transfer of cluster munitions systems to those that have a failure rate of 1% or lower and mandating that any country importing US cluster munitions only may use them against clearly defined military targets where no civilians are present.  Despite objections to the restrictions, President Bush signed it into law in December 2007, effectively ending the sale of cluster munitions for one year.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to prohibit trade in cluster munitions.  This legislation emanates from the Wellington declaration on cluster munitions, which was itself informed by previous international conferences in Vienna, Lima and Oslo on the prohibition of cluster munitions.  It also is informed by the draft cluster munitions convention agreed at the Wellington conference on January 21 2008.</P>
        <P>In so far as trade in cluster munitions exists in Ireland today, this is effectively symbolic legislation.  Ireland does not produce or use cluster munitions and has no stockpiles to destroy, which is an important issue for other signatories to the Wellington convention.  In that vein, the purpose of this Bill in prohibiting the trade, transit or procurement of cluster munitions is that it will set an example and contribute to the international movement to outlaw such munitions.</P>
        <P>The portion of the Bill that will have significance for Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to eliminating cluster munitions is the restriction on financing companies engaged in the trade or procurement of cluster munitions.  In so doing, Ireland will be going further than the requirements of the draft convention as it may be agreed and will be the first country to take a maximal approach to removing cluster munitions from international affairs by stemming the flow of finance to the production of munitions and by taking a step on behalf of the Irish people to demand their money must be used to finance projects in a clear and transparent manner.</P>
        <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund invested approximately &euro;27 million in companies trading in cluster bombs last year.  The fund has a share of approximately 25% of the Irish pension industry assets.  It is not an unreasonable assumption to suggest the portfolio investment strategies of private pension fund investment companies are similar to that of the National Pension Reserve Fund and that, therefore, on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, the total Irish investment in cluster munitions is slightly more than &euro;100 million.</P>
        <P>It is hoped that by placing a requirement on banks and pension funds to declare annually that they have not financed companies involved in trade of cluster munitions, the social and moral voice of the people will be heard in refusing to allow their money to be directed to such <Col N="340"/>companies.  This first instance forced disclosure regulatory framework is the best way for this to be achieved.  Nevertheless, Fine Gael&rsquo;s Bill provides for serious punitive measure to be imposed were compliance under this provision not to be attained.</P>
        <P>I will outline the provisions of the Cluster Munitions Bill 2008.  Section 1 gives the Short Title of the Act as the Cluster Munitions Act 2008.  Section 2 is the definitional section.  Cluster munitions are defined as &ldquo;containers comprising explosive sub-munitions over an area which are intended to disperse these sub-munitions over an area in order to detonate them before, on or after impact&rdquo;.  They do not include &ldquo;flare and smoke ammunitions or pyrotechnical chemicals&rdquo;.  The definition has been adopted from Article 2 of the draft convention on cluster munitions, which has emerged as the standard international definition and is the definition used in those countries that have already imposed bans on cluster munitions.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
        <P>The definition of trade in cluster munitions is deliberately wide in order to encompass all forms of activity that may be associated with the use, design, possession, procurement, transit or trade in cluster munitions.  The definition states: &ldquo;trade in cluster munitions means development, design, production, purchase, sale, supply, procurement, import, export, transit, use storage or possession of cluster munitions&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Section 3 is the key operative section of the Bill and sets out the prohibition on trade in cluster munitions by any person or body corporate.  It also prohibits persons investing in or financing companies involved in the trade of cluster munitions.  In order to provide transparency as to which companies trade in cluster munitions, a register of prohibited investment in cluster munitions will be established by section 8 of the Bill, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  However, for the purpose of section 3, it will be an offence for a person or body corporate to invest in a person, including a body corporate, that is placed on the register.</P>
        <P>This will have clear implications for banks and fund managers in Ireland.  It now will be the case that such companies must make inquiries as to whether their investment is being used to finance a company involved in trade in cluster munitions.  It is important to stress that the obligation created is a positive one.  Persons making such investment must take active steps to ensure they are not investing in companies involved in the trade of cluster munitions and neglecting to so do will not be a defence.  This is contained in section 4 of the Bill.  However, it will be a defence to show that reasonable inspection could not have established that the investment was in trade of cluster munitions or a person or company involved in same.</P>
        <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides the penalties for commission of this offence.  The penalty on summary conviction will be &euro;3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both.  The penalty for conviction on indictment will be a fine of &euro;1 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both.  As usual, it will be for the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine from the nature of the case which form of prosecution is appropriate on a case by case basis.  It is clear from these penalties that Fine Gael&rsquo;s goal is to achieve compliance with the legislative provisions, rather than being obliged to take the punitive route straight away.</P><Col N="341"/>
        <P>No one benefits from the investment in trade in cluster munitions actually occurring, with the resulting fine imposed to be merely a tax on the investment.  For this reason Fine Gael has suggested the fine should be comparatively low in the first instance at summary prosecution but that it should be increased dramatically for conviction on indictment to &euro;1 million.  While Fine Gael believes that encouraging compliance is the preferred option, the indictment penalty should be sufficiently large to put off even the most profitable of pensions funds.</P>
        <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides that any cluster munitions found will be confiscated by the State and destroyed, at the expense of the owner of the cluster munitions.  It also provides that the Minister will have the discretion to confiscate any means of transport used to transport cluster munitions.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides the framework for achieving compliance with the provisions of the Bill through forced disclosure that no investment in cluster munitions has occurred.</P>
        <P>This Bill is the first of its kind to go further than the international consensus by targeting cluster munitions at their source, namely, funding.  I believe that providing for the utmost transparency in investment and financing will itself operate as a mechanism of regulation.  I believe the Irish people do not wish to see their money being used to develop and produce cluster munitions and that through their capacity as consumers they have enormous power to dictate the corporate social responsibility agenda of large corporate bodies.  While the framework provided should stem the need for prosecutions, Fine Gael strongly advocates that where it does not, heavy financial penalties should be imposed by the courts.</P>
        <P>It is not the goal of Fine Gael to go after big business, stem the profitability of pension funds, put company directors in jail or impose massive fines that would dent the competitiveness of Irish funds.  Our goal is to remove cluster munitions from the vernacular of international affairs.  It is to remove these horrifically destructive weapons from use and to prevent them from injuring innocent civilians many years after the original conflict.  As Ireland neither produces nor stores them, how can Members act to ensure that Ireland plays no role in their development and use?  It has a small but powerful economy and through the provision of a regulatory framework, backed up by serious punitive measures to prohibit investment in cluster munitions, it can make its mark in the fight against the use of these cruel weapons of war.</P>
        <P>One regularly hears the Government claiming the Opposition fails to come up with proposals.  This proposal in no way conflicts with Government policy and I am sure it reflects the will of the people.  While I do not believe there are difficulties associated with the Bill, any such difficulties may be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not include efforts to deal with human damage, which I believe should be addressed through humanitarian aid.  In addition, the Bill does not rule out Ireland operating with countries that still use such munitions, as this would have too great an impact on Ireland&rsquo;s peacekeeping duties.  However, Ireland would never operate in the system in an offensive manner when such weapons would be used.  The Minister should reflect before moving his amendment.</P>

        <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Timmins, for introducing this legislation.  Those who may be watching proceedings from outside the Chamber and who are not familiar with this campaign or issue may be wondering the reason Fine Gael has introduced this Bill before the House when many domestic issues need to be addressed.  When people listen to what has been said, they will realise this is an important issue in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and our humanitarian and peacekeeping work.</P>
        <P>Having read the Government amendment, I do not understand why the Minister for Foreign Affairs cannot accept this Bill with a view to amending it at a later stage if he deems it appropriate to do so.  The Bill is timely because this House has an opportunity to provide leadership in advance of the conference in Croke Park at the end of May, when representatives from all over the world will meet to discuss the issue.  I wish the Minister well in achieving the conference&rsquo;s goal of agreeing a text on an international convention banning the use of these weapons, which pose a particular threat to children.  This evening presents us with an opportunity for Ireland to put legislation in place domestically to ensure companies based here in no way support, supply or profit from the cluster bomb industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The international campaign to ban cluster munitions has been proactive and it continues to gather pace and influence.  In February 2007 an international meeting in Oslo set in motion the process of concluding by 2008 a legally binding international instrument that prohibits the use and stockpiling of cluster munitions and secures adequate care and rehabilitation for sufferers and clearance of contaminated areas. Initially, 46 states agreed to the Oslo declaration, followed by meetings in Lima in May 2006 and Vienna in December 2007 attended by 138 states.  This February, a meeting in Wellington agreed to the Wellington declaration which reaffirmed the objectives set out in Oslo.  We hope the Dublin conference, which will be held between 19 and 30 May, will be the final piece in the jigsaw of drafting the first international agreement on cluster munitions.  The Minister might not be in his current job by the end of May but, if he is, it will be a significant achievement for Irish foreign policy if he reaches an agreement.</P>
        <P>I spent three years in the European Parliament working on a variety of human rights issues.  I compiled paragraphs for two annual human rights reports for the Parliament which called for a ban on cluster munitions and increased momentum towards an international arms trade treaty which would initially focus on small arms.  The existing code of conduct for the sale of arms within the EU is not sufficient and needs to be made legally binding.</P>
        <P>Since the 1950s cluster bombs have been used in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Chad, Iraq, Chechnya, Sudan and Kosovo.  In 2006, up to 4 million cluster bombs were dropped in southern Lebanon.  I recall the Israeli ambassador to the EU coming before a human rights sub-committee of the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs in an attempt to justify the deployment of that quantity of cluster bombs on an area which will be contaminated for decades to come because of decisions taken at the end of the hostilities.  The only excuse he could give was that the bombs were brightly coloured and therefore civilians and children in particular were unlikely to stand on them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are brutal, crude and indiscriminate weapons.  They are not intended to target soldiers.  Their purpose is clearing land and making it almost impossible for people to return to their homes following conflict.  They are often used in bitter situations prior to the signing of military truces to inflict damage that lasts decades after the cessation of hostilities.  They have no place in modern military operations and any defence of them needs to be strongly challenged.  Confirmed casualties from cluster munitions exceed 13,000 but it is believed that figure is many times lower than the actual number of deaths and injuries because in many of the countries contaminated by them it has become impossible to get accurate records.  Civilians comprise <Col N="343"/>98% of the casualties of cluster munitions.  They are more lethal than landmines because it is at least possible to keep a record of where landmines have been deployed in order to facilitate the process of clearing minefields.  Dropping a cluster bomb is like firing thousands of tennis balls in all directions from 100 feet above the ground.  They land in such a variety of areas that it is almost impossible to clear them.</P>
        <P>This is an area of foreign policy which Ireland should aggressively pursue in order to bring about an end to weapons which should have been discontinued many years ago.  Unfortunately, they will continue to maim and kill children and their families for decades to come in areas which have already suffered enough from conflict.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Timmins on having the heart and the guts to bring this Bill before the D&aacute;il.  People might say we have more important matters to consider but this is a very serious issue.  I call on the Minister to accept the Bill given that on 13 December 2007 the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs called for the Government to introduce legislation to deal with cluster bombs.  The late Princess Diana was one of the people who led the campaign on cluster munitions.  The devastation wrought by these weapons is outrageous.</P>
        <P>Cluster bombs were used in Iraq.  God help the people of that country because the ammunition used against them is not known.  We were told they had weapons of mass destruction but some of them did not even have a loaf of bread to feed themselves or keep themselves alive.  We listened to propaganda from governments that should have known better.  To this day, no weapons of mass destruction were found.  The only destruction that has been found were the dead bodies buried by Saddam Hussein.  Governments knew what was happening in that country and its dictator should and could have been taken out.  We did not need to kill so many thousands of people in Iraq.  Dictators were removed in other countries and the dictator in Iraq could have been similarly treated.  It is wrong that any civilised government or army would use this kind of weapon to kill people.  As Deputy Timmins said, young children walking and playing often pick up these brightly coloured bombs and end up without an arm or leg and in some cases are killed.  It is time these weapons were taken out of existence.  The Government has a very important part to play.  We do not know whether Deputy Dermot Ahern will be Minister for Foreign Affairs next week or whether he will be Minister for Finance or T&aacute;naiste.  However, we call on him to use his influence and that of the Government to ensure these bombs are taken out of existence so young children and innocent people will not be murdered in future.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, under the chairmanship of Deputy Michael Woods, has called for this.</P>
        <P>I again compliment Deputy Timmins for bringing this important and timely motion to the House.  I wish our troops in Chad the very best of luck. It is a dangerous mission and I hope every single one of them who goes there will come back safely.  I know they will do this country proud, as they have done in the past.  Deputy Timmins did this country proud.  He served his country abroad and he knows what he is taking about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Timmins on this important motion.  I urge the House to support the Cluster Munitions Bill 2008.  While concerned citizens of the world work to pass legislation to limit the production, storage, export and use of various forms of cluster munitions, it is important that we in this country ensure we have no hand, act or part in the financing, manufacturing or transport of components for cluster bombs.  To do so will also send a message to other countries that such weapons are an unacceptable part of any military arsenal.</P><Col N="344"/>
        <P>Cluster munitions are widely stockpiled by more than 70 states and are documented to have caused significant civilian deaths and injuries and have frequently been used indiscriminately during conflicts.  They have injured and killed thousands of innocent civilians in some 25 countries.  From the first large-scale use of cluster bombs in Laos from 1964 to 1973 to the most recent use of cluster bombs in Lebanon in 2006, the results have remained the same.</P>
        <P>Cluster munitions eject a large number of smaller bomblets.  The most common types are intended to kill enemy personnel and destroy vehicles.  Cluster bombs often miss their target and significant numbers of cluster bombs fail to function as designed.  The area affected by a single cluster munition, known as its footprint, can be as large as two or three football fields.  Because of the weapon&rsquo;s broad area of effect, it has often been documented as striking both civilian and military objects in the target area.  The cluster bombs disperse over a wide area in ways that are not predictable.  This characteristic of the weapon is particularly dangerous for civilians when cluster munitions are used in or near populated areas and has been documented by research reports from groups such as Human Rights Watch.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While all weapons are potentially dangerous to civilians, cluster bombs pose a particular threat to civilians as they have consistently left behind a large number of unexploded bomblets.  These bomblets remain dangerous for decades after the end of a conflict.  They are prone to indiscriminate use and they pose severe and lasting risks to civilians from unexploded submunitions.  The bomblets may be duds, a significant percentage may not detonate as designed and in some cases the weapons are designed to detonate at a later stage.  For example, after the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, UN experts estimated that as many as 1 million unexploded bomblets contaminate the hundreds of cluster munition strike sites in Lebanon.  In all these cases, the surviving bomblets are live and can explode when handled, making them a serious threat to civilians entering the area.  In effect, they function like landmines and in practice are more dangerous as they are more likely to kill than injure a casualty.</P>
        <P>Cluster bombs injure and kill civilians long after wars are over.  They cause significant humanitarian impact on the local civilian population.  Bombs that fail to explode on impact are still lethal and often maim or kill adults and especially children going about their daily activities long after hostilities are past.  Through more than 40 years of use, over 90% of known cluster bomb casualties are civilians.  Up to 98% of 13,306 recorded cluster munitions casualties that are registered with Handicap International are civilians.</P>
        <P>Belgium was the first country to issue a ban on the carrying, transportation, export, stockpiling, trade and production of cluster munitions.  Austria followed suit in 2007.  This Cluster Munitions Bill 2008 provides us with an extraordinary opportunity to stand with the ordinary citizens of the world community by doing our part to stop the manufacture, export and use of cluster bombs that are known to cause irreparable harm to civilian communities.</P>
        <P>It is important that we unite with one voice to send a strong message to the rest of the world that Ireland wants a comprehensive ban treaty at the negotiations to take place in Dublin this May.  I urge the Minister to consider this Bill seriously.  I compliment Deputy Timmins and urge support for his important legislation, which would give a very clear message.  We must stand united on this issue, which Deputy Timmins has correctly brought to the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with previous speakers in complimenting Deputy Timmins on bringing forward this important legislation.  As Deputy Ring said, Deputy Timmins has served on a number of UN missions and has first-hand knowledge of the effects of cluster bombs on the ground.  With that experience, he speaks with great authority on this subject.  We are lucky to have somebody of his calibre and experience in the House because of his informed judgment on various international issues regarding UN missions.</P><Col N="345"/>
        <P>As Deputy Timmins noted, cluster munitions are a large and growing problem.  If their use continues to spread &mdash; if some countries have their way, this will happen &mdash; and the number of countries using them continues to grow, which is happening, they may become an even greater humanitarian and development challenge than anti-personnel mines were in the 1990s.</P>
        <P>During the past 20 years, wars in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere have clearly demonstrated the unacceptable humanitarian consequences of this type of weapon, not only during wars but also long after armed conflicts have ended.  We have seen many television programmes that dealt with the consequences of cluster munitions and we have seen how many people lost limbs, with families being destroyed while going about their daily business.  The consequences are horrific.</P>
        <P>Cluster munitions cover large areas and do not discriminate between civilians and military personnel.  Depending on the type of munition, the size of the area they cover ranges from a few hundred metres to about 20 hectares.  When people are being attacked, they are prepared for it but what is worse about cluster munitions is that they often produce a large number of duds, which can have horrific consequences.  These remain lying on the ground, on roofs, in collapsed houses or even caught in trees and can have the same effect as anti-personnel mines.</P>
        <P>The Minister has played a leading role internationally in his opposition to cluster bombs.  Given that approximately 80 governments from all over the world will converge on Croke Park in May for the two-week conference, the Minister would be armed in some way if he accepted Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s legislation.  He could point to the fact there is unanimity in the House on this issue and that the Opposition had brought forward a very good Bill, which the Minister was prepared to accept and move to Committee to be improved or refined.  I am disappointed that as a pragmatist, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, could not accept the Bill proposed by Deputy Timmins.  I accept the Minister is probably getting direction from somewhere.  The Bill is well considered and thought through and would be very effective if implemented.  It would also lead the way internationally and provide a basis for good and effective legislation.</P>

        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />welcoming the role being played by the Government in international efforts to secure a total prohibition on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians through its active participation in international initiatives to address the issue comprehensively, in line with its commitments in the programme for Government;</P><Col N="346"/>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />noting that this committee will have, as its first task, the preparation of comprehensive draft legislation to give effect to the new instrument and to enact a domestic ban, thereby enabling its early introduction in the Oireachtas;</P>
        <P LI="1">resolves that the Cluster Munitions Bill 2008 be read a Second Time this day nine months.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Some time back I visited Lebanon in the aftermath of the recent conflagration between the Lebanese and Israel and saw for myself the incredible work that our troops were carrying out there in assistance with the Finns.  During the visit I saw also the devastation caused by cluster munitions.  As a result I said clearly to my officials that I wanted Ireland to be in the vanguard of nations in proposing an international ban on these most unacceptable instruments of war.  Accordingly, I asked last year that the Fianna F&aacute;il general election manifesto contain the specific commitment that, if returned to office, we would campaign for a complete ban on the use of cluster munitions.  Thankfully, in the negotiations for Government involving ourselves, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats, there was support for the inclusion of the proposed ban contained in the election manifesto in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>Today that campaign is Government policy and is led by my Department.  One of the major inputs into this campaign is the holding of an international conference in Dublin in May.  The aim is to conclude a legally binding convention that will prohibit the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  There will also be measures to deal with the care and rehabilitation of survivors, clearance of contaminated areas, risk education and destruction of stockpiles.</P>
        <P>In that context I welcome the opportunity to give vent to a number of issues in this area.  I thank the Opposition parties for their strong support but I wish to point out that this is something which should not divide the parties in this House.  I made an effort to ensure we would not divide in this House and I will outline the reason we cannot accept the Fine Gael Bill, which I will not criticise.  The strategy which the Government has adopted is the correct one given that next month there will be a significant conference which up to 1,000 delegates will attend for two weeks to deliberate on this issue.  I am pleased to acknowledge the shared revulsion of all the parties in this House on the use of cluster munitions.  It is important to recognise that the Seanad also tabled an all-party motion on 6 March last on this issue.</P>
        <P>One of the issues that is important in this context is the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  As Members of this House are aware, but perhaps not those outside it, the Government put in place a substantial pension reserve fund to pay for a portion of pensions into the future.  As part of that process, fund managers are given an opportunity to invest in companies around the world.  They do that independent of Government.  It came to my attention in recent months that there was a possibility that National Pensions Reserve Fund managers could be investing in companies involved in the manufacture of cluster munitions.  When it was brought to my attention a number of months ago I raised the matter with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance and I also spoke at the time to the chairman and CEO of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to insist that as far as Government was concerned no public funds should be expended on these investments.</P><Col N="347"/>
        <P>Thankfully, the National Pensions Reserve Fund has indicated it is willing to move along those lines based on ethical guidelines and on the example we are taking from the Norwegians who have banned investment by its pensions reserve fund in specific companies.  No public funds should be invested in these cluster munitions and we will give cover to the National Pensions Reserve Fund in the proposed legislation we will bring forward in the coming months.</P>
        <P>While the investment issue is the main focus, apart from the total ban, the Government accepts it is only one element of the broader, more comprehensive approach that is required on this issue.  Ireland has never possessed cluster munitions, nor does it intend to, and is therefore not in the situation of a number of states which have adopted national prohibitions.  Our firm intention is to legislate for a total domestic ban on cluster munitions and, in addition, to give effect to the provisions of the convention which we hope will be agreed next month at the conference.  This legislation not only will be intended to prohibit the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions but will go much further.</P>
        <P>I do not want to rush the legislation, I want a legislative template for other nations.  I reiterate that I do not wish the House to divide on this issue.  In addition to a complete ban on cluster munitions, our legislation will contain provisions for assistance to victims of cluster munitions; the clearance of areas contaminated by unexploded cluster munitions &mdash; I saw the Irish troops working with the Finns on my visit to Lebanon; assistance in the destruction of stockpiles of cluster munitions; and for other matters to be agreed in negotiations at the Dublin diplomatic conference.</P>
        <P>I want this to be the comprehensive model for other nations sharing our determination to rid the world of these munitions.  That is why I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the negotiations by enacting legislation this month and then find that following the diplomatic conference we have to, in effect, go back to the drawing board.  I firmly believe that is what we should do or we would fail to provide adequately for the obligations the State will assume under the new instrument.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention, therefore, to enact the necessary legislation as soon as possible following conclusion of the negotiations and finalisation of the convention at the conference in May.  I stress that this approach is supported by prominent non-governmental organisations in this area who agree with the Government&rsquo;s approach.  They believe it will ensure the most effective and complete implementation of any new agreement that is reached next month.  The Government therefore believes that the D&aacute;il should postpone consideration of the Bill for nine months.</P>
        <P>We do not disagree with the thrust of the Bill, but we think it would make sense to legislate when we are fully clear on the international dimension of the issue, as per the conference next month.  To ensure that the legislation is of the highest possible quality, the Government has agreed to establish a new national committee on humanitarian law, which will have as its first task preparation of comprehensive legislation.  My intention is that the committee, on which all relevant Departments and offices of State will be represented, will begin its work in advance of the diplomatic conference so that the Oireachtas will be in a position to enact legislation at an early date and thereby enable Ireland&rsquo;s early ratification of any new convention.</P>
        <P>When prepared, the draft legislation will be given the necessary priority in the Oireachtas timetable.  I already have the agreement of Government in that respect.  Ireland was one of the first countries to ratify the Ottawa Convention and I hope Members share my desire to ensure that Ireland should be among the first to ratify the cluster munitions convention which I hope will emerge from the Dublin conference.</P>
        <P>The 2007-12 programme for Government commits us to:</P><Col N="348"/>
        <P LI="1">Campaign for a complete ban on the use of cluster munitions.  In the absence of a full ban we will seek agreement on an immediate freeze on the use of cluster munitions pending the establishment of effective international instruments to address humanitarian concerns regarding their use.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Ireland has been playing an important role in international efforts to this end through its participation in the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and, more significantly, through active engagement and leadership in the Oslo process.  The Dublin diplomatic conference will be the critical stage in the process and while difficult issues remain, I am confident it will be possible to finalise a treaty at the conference.</P>
        <P>For several years, Ireland has been expressing its concerns at the unacceptable consequences of the use of cluster munitions in the UN context.  Two main issues arise.  First, the use of cluster munitions can be indiscriminate at the time of use, thus harming civilians who are within range and in practice this is usually the case.  Second, the high failure rate of submunitions at the time of impact creates an enduring hazard of unexploded ordnance, causing casualties long after the cessation of hostilities and making much land unusable.  At present, international humanitarian law does not adequately address these concerns.  The lethal consequences of these weapons were most recently apparent in southern Lebanon but have also affected south-east Asia, the Balkans and other theatres of war.</P>
        <P>In light of the absence of progress in Geneva and inspired by the process which led to the conclusion of the Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines ten years ago, Norway convened a meeting in Oslo in February 2007 of countries ready to explore ways to address the issue of cluster munitions in a determined and effective manner.  Forty-six states present adopted the Oslo declaration which committed them to conclude by 2008 a legally binding international instrument that will &ldquo;prohibit the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians&rdquo;.  Ireland is one of seven states driving the Oslo process, along with Norway, Austria, New Zealand, Mexico, Peru and the Holy See.  We have participated actively in a series of conferences in Oslo, Lima, Vienna and, most recently, Wellington to identify the issues, clarify positions and formulate a draft treaty.</P>
        <P>Political momentum has grown significantly and almost 100 states have already endorsed the recent Wellington declaration which lays the foundation for the Dublin diplomatic conference.  Many more states are expected to indicate their support in the coming months and participate in the negotiations in Dublin.  Current expectations are that between 800 and 1,000 delegates from a wide range of governments, international organisations and NGOs will attend the conference.  On behalf of Ireland, I offered to host this important conference which will last for two weeks and bring considerable business to Dublin and Croke Park.  On my instruction, embassies around the world are actively seeking to ascertain the positions of countries as we prepare for the conference.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Significant differences remain to be resolved on key issues such as definitions, any possible period of transition to a ban and future military co-operation, including in UN-mandated missions with states not party to the convention, an issue raised by Deputy Timmins.  There is reason to believe that these differences can be resolved and prospective solutions for many less contentious issues have already emerged in the course of the earlier meetings in the process.  I am confident we are on track for the adoption of a convention which will be comprehensive and effective and will get users, producers and cluster munitions-affected states on board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also our aim to establish a new norm of international humanitarian law which will influence the behaviour of every state engaging in conflict, regardless of whether they have <Col N="349"/>ratified the convention.  This has been the experience of the Ottawa Convention in stigmatising the use of landmines, even by states which are not party to it.  We believe this experience can be emulated.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the key aim of the new treaty will be to prohibit the unacceptable humanitarian harm caused by cluster munitions.  However, we must also look to the past impact and the damage inflicted on societies and individuals by these horrendous weapons.  I saw the terrible risk posed to civilian populations by unexploded cluster munitions in Lebanon when I was given a demonstration by the Defence Forces of the types of cluster munitions used in the area by the Israelis.  It was significant that some of these devices looked very much like children&rsquo;s toys.  An annex to the recent Winograd report on the Israeli war against Lebanon clearly shows the difficulties that the authors of the report saw in relation to the use by the Israelis of cluster munitions in Lebanon.</P>
        <P>The draft convention contains strong provisions for humanitarian assistance to victims, the clearance of areas contaminated by unexploded cluster munitions, assistance in the destruction of stockpiles of these weapons and risk education.  I am hopeful the treaty which emerges from the negotiations will be the most comprehensive of its kind in addressing these needs.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to support for victim assistance, clearance of areas contaminated by unexploded remnants of war, destruction of stockpiles, risk education and support for rehabilitation of survivors and their socioeconomic integration.  As I outlined, these issues will be addressed comprehensively in the convention.  I emphasise our desire to ensure the provisions of the convention will be included in legislation.</P>
        <P>Even now, the Government is working to fulfil these commitments in close co-operation with NGOs and with UN agencies.  Since 2000, we have provided approximately &euro;20 million in funding to meet needs in this area.  Irish Aid has an ongoing relationship with a number of the leading NGOs operating in this field.  Our partners include HALO Trust, Mine Action Group and Handicap International and we have provided funding to Explosive Remnants of War &mdash; ERW &mdash; and relief measures in Somalia, Afghanistan, Angola, Mozambique and Iraq, among other countries.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael P. Kitt, recently approved &euro;1.875 million<b> </b>of funding for HALO Trust&rsquo;s de-mining activities in three countries in 2008.  It is anticipated that the expansion of the Irish Aid budget will result in an increase in the level of funding available to respond to proposals from suitable partners.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Cluster Munitions Bill before us contains a broad definition of &ldquo;trade&rdquo; in cluster munitions, which encompasses not only what is generally understood to be trade, that is, import, export and transit, but also such aspects as development, design and production.  I will focus briefly on the purely trade issues, in particular control on the export and transit of cluster munitions.  In the context of its commitment to disarmament and arms control, Ireland has committed to operating an effective export control system in accordance with our international obligations.  In this regard, Deputies will be aware that just over a month ago we enacted the new Control of Exports Act 2008 which updates and modernises our legislative regime governing the export of military and dual use goods.  It is timely to recall what the legislation sought to achieve because while I do not believe there is any real prospect of the manufacture of cluster munitions being undertaken here, the Control of Exports Act remains relevant to ensuring there can be no export, brokering or rendering of technical assistance in relation to such munitions.</P>
        <P>The Control of Exports Act represents this Government&rsquo;s tangible commitment to having in place a robust export control system that can best meet the challenges we face at a time of rapid geopolitical and technological developments.  Combating cluster munitions is one of these <Col N="350"/>challenges.  Section 3 of the Act enables the control of arms brokering activities.  Not only does it provide for controls to be imposed on brokering activities undertaken in the State, it also extends such controls with regard to activities outside the State if undertaken by an Irish citizen or company.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of extra-territoriality was a key consideration when framing this section.  A person normally resident here could, for example, arrange for an arms transfer, while temporally outside the State, of goods which at no point transit through Ireland.  In the absence of appropriate legislation, on his or her return to Ireland no prosecution could follow, notwithstanding that an arms embargo might have been breached or Irish export control laws evaded.</P>
      
        <P>Section 5 of the Control of Exports Act provides for orders or regulations to be made to control technical assistance, such as repairs, maintenance, development, manufacture, assembly, testing, training and instruction and consultancy services.  The joint action commits member states to imposing controls on technical assistance in connection with certain military uses.  During the debate on the Act, and in the context of drafting the secondary legislation to give it full effect, the Government indicated its willingness to examine the possibility of broadening this control in consultation with interested parties.</P>
        <P>I value the commitment of all Oireachtas parties to combat the scourge of these weapons.  The Government is determined to achieve the strongest possible prohibition of cluster munitions and to make a meaningful difference to the lives and livelihood of vulnerable civilians around the world who have suffered from their use.  I have made clear my personal and long-standing engagement on this issue.</P>
        <P>Ireland is playing a strong leadership role in international efforts to this end through its participation in the Oslo process and the convening of the forthcoming Dublin conference.  We are committed to carrying forward the outcome of the conference in domestic legislation and policy and ensure the resources at our disposal are available to support victim assistance etc.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Timmins for introducing his Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  I must, however, emphasise the Government is not voting against the Bill but postponing it because we believe it needs to be much more comprehensive.  It makes no sense to pass legislation and then restrict ourselves on Committee Stage.  At my instigation, Dublin will host the forthcoming diplomatic conference on cluster munitions in May.  After that, there will be a better and broader idea of what is required in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While Deputy Timmins introduced the Bill as an Opposition Member, he has acknowledged the Government has worked away on this matter.  However, I believe it is better to park the legislation.  The Government will introduce its legislation over the next nine months after the conference&rsquo;s deliberations.  Then we will have a better opportunity to deal with the broader issues involved, not just a total ban on cluster munitions but the issues concerning the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</P>

        <P>I thank Deputy Timmins and the Fine Gael Party for their engagement on the cluster munitions issue, which is of high priority for the Government and on which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has personally taken a lead role.  I fully support the Minister&rsquo;s course of action and his proposed amendment.</P><Col N="351"/>
        <P Just="Left">For several years, Ireland has expressed its concerns in the UN at the unacceptable consequences of the use of cluster munitions.  The use of cluster munitions can be indiscriminate, harming civilians within range.  Their high failure rate at impact creates an enduring hazard of unexploded ordnance, causing casualties long after the cessation of hostilities and making much land unusable.  International humanitarian law does not adequately address these concerns.  The lethal consequences of these weapons were recently apparent in southern Lebanon but have also affected south-east Asia, the Balkans and other theatres of war.</P>
        <P>Our concern on this issue is inspired by our tradition of involvement in UN peacekeeping operations in the Lebanon, former Yugoslavia and Eritrea.  There our troops were exposed to the hazards inherent in clearance of unexploded cluster munitions and witnessed the harm caused by them to civilians.  Many brave peacekeepers from the Dublin South-West constituency have participated in these operations.</P>
        <P>Cluster munitions were first used on the port of Grimsby during the Second World War.  They subsequently formed part of NATO arsenals during the Cold War for possible defensive use in the event of a large-scale invasion from the East across the central European plains.</P>
        <P>They were used on an enormous scale during the Vietnam War, with Laos, not even a declared participant in the war, becoming the most affected country in the world.  It has over 9 million unexploded submunitions, many of which continue to cause casualties and remain to be cleared.  There was also extensive use during the wars involving Iraq.  In Israel&rsquo;s attempt in 2006 to counter Hizbollah operating from within Lebanon, some 4 million submunitions were fired into south Lebanon, leaving around 1 million unexploded individual submunitions on the ground.</P>
        <P>Inspired by the process which led to the conclusion of the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, Norway convened a meeting of countries ready to explore ways to address this pressing humanitarian issue in a determined and effective manner.  Recognising the grave consequences caused by the use of cluster munitions and the need for immediate action, 46 states gathered in Oslo in February 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">They adopted the Oslo declaration, which committed them to conclude by 2008 a legally binding international instrument that will &ldquo;prohibit the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians&rdquo;.  They also committed to co-operation and assistance for survivors and affected communities, clearance of affected areas and destruction of stockpiles.  They agreed to consider steps at national level, pending adoption of a treaty.</P>
        <P>Follow-up meetings in Lima, Vienna and Wellington saw the number of participating states grow to over 130.  Many are also involved in the UN&rsquo;s convention on certain conventional weapons, the CCW process, and hope for a complementary approach in both fora.  To date, the influence has been one-way, with Oslo stimulating discussion in the CCW, albeit without any concrete results.  Apart from the fact that not all affected states are party to the CCW, its main difficulty is that decisions are taken by consensus, meaning there is little realistic prospect of users or producers agreeing to a meaningful treaty.</P>
        <P>Ireland is one of seven states driving the Oslo process, along with Norway, Austria, New Zealand, Mexico, Peru and the Holy See.  We have participated actively in the conferences in Oslo, Lima, Vienna and Wellington to identify the issues, clarify positions and formulate a draft treaty.  Political momentum has grown significantly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the February conference in Wellington, more than 80 states immediately endorsed the Wellington declaration, which lays the foundation for the Dublin diplomatic conference to take <Col N="352"/>place in Croke Park in May.  Many more states are expected to indicate their support in the coming months and participate in the Dublin negotiations.</P>
        <P>There are still significant differences to be resolved on key issues such as definitions, any possible period of transition to a ban and future military co-operation, including in UN-mandated missions with states not party to a convention.  There is, however, reason to believe these can be resolved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prospective solutions for many less contentious issues have already emerged in the course of the earlier meetings in the process.  It is important this process results in a text which will stand the test of time with technological developments, and capable of attracting adherents to gain critical mass.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am confident we are on track for the adoption of a convention which will be comprehensive and effective and will get users, producers and states affected by cluster munitions on board.  It is also our aim to establish a new norm of international humanitarian law which will influence the behaviour of every state engaged in conflict, regardless of whether they have ratified the convention.  This has been the experience of the Ottawa convention in stigmatising the use of land mines even by states not party to it.  We believe this experience can be emulated.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well in dealing with this matter.  I am happy to praise the two Wicklow Deputies across the Chamber who often travel through Tallaght.  I wish them well in that regard.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">First, I join with others in welcoming the opportunity to discuss this issue.  Before I go further I pay tribute to Pax Christi, which has been informing Deputies and Senators about the issue, and particularly Tony D&rsquo;Costa, who has worked not just on this issue but previously on the landmines matter.  That work should be supported.</P>
        <P>The two issues which arise are important.  There is an issue of principle, that is, whether we want from the conference a complete and universal ban with no exceptions.  That is a fundamental.  An issue arising from this is a matter of definition.  There will be a struggle over definition, represented by countries on one side such as France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which will seek to retain certain forms of cluster munitions.  It would be pointless to imagine this will not happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When we speak of a universal ban without exception, a second issue arises of how we will achieve this goal.  Previous speakers made interesting remarks drawing parallels with the Ottawa Convention on landmines, which is interesting in this regard.  I was a member of the Cabinet at that time and I propose to refer to some of the experience of Dick Spring in the influencing of that convention.</P>
        <P>The second point is therefore a simple one &mdash; how do we achieve a complete and universal ban without exceptions?  As a matter of housekeeping, I indicate that if we were to operate very quickly, we could make a statutory instrument.  A legal opinion was advised to me that we could take Statutory Instrument 175/1996, the order entitled Explosive (Landmines) Order 1996, and model a statutory instrument on that.  Why would we do so?  I will turn to the Fine Gael Bill in a moment.  A political choice has to be made but we would act in this way precisely <Col N="353"/>for the reason one influenced the Ottawa Convention.  We would do so because we want to lay down a kind of template to govern the outcome of the conference.  The political choice therefore is one as to whether we wait for the committee, wait nine months and respond to a conference which we have missed the opportunity of influencing.  That is the political reality.</P>
        <P>I would favour the drafting of a statutory instrument so as to have it quickly in place before the conference takes place but I am still happy to support a Second Stage reading of the Fine Gael proposal.  I congratulate Deputy Timmins on bringing the Fine Gael Party with him.  If the Bill passed Second Stage, I would, on behalf of the Labour Party, propose significant amendments on Committee Stage.  They would perhaps be reflective of the motion, in my name and that of Senator Norris, passed by the foreign affairs committee.  That included a number of issues but I would stress one particular factor.  If we go for a universal ban on cluster munitions because of the reasons we have heard from speakers on all sides, we must therefore be consistent and refuse to have our troops use them, even if they are involved in joint operations with other forces, be it in terms of peace establishment, peace making, peacekeeping and so forth.</P>
        <P>I come therefore to two principles which exist.  One is incredibly important and it is tragic it even must be mentioned.  This is the sheer nature of cluster bombs, attractive-looking colourful things lying on the ground to be picked up by children or anybody.  We can see the consequences in terms of their widespread diffusion, like droplets, which can lead to the removal of limbs and death.  Some 80 million of these were dropped in Vietnam by the United States, and a million were dropped in southern Lebanon in the last 48 hours before peace.  I agree with speakers who have stated the purpose of such bombs is to clear areas rather than achieve significant military advantage.  I do not need to repeat figures which have been given already about the fact that, as a military exercise, these munitions are quite insufficient in many respects and in terms of their projected aim.  The real aim is to make an area unusable, with 98% casualties, as has been pointed out.  There is no study to suggest civilian casualties are less than 90%.  We are agreed on that.  If we are now going to address the issue of definition and technology, it must be such that people cannot bring new forms of cluster munition into existence.  That is the issue of definition and there is nothing vague in it.  It is also perfectly clear that France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands will want to go down that road.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The next part of the issue relates to making a ban universal, which includes principles such as interoperability.  What is done in that regard?  Looking at the replies given in this House by my colleague, the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, former Deputy Dick Spring, the slow process we went through going to the endpoint of the Ottawa Convention on landmines becomes clear.  At a crucial stage it was very important Norway and Ireland did just what is now being advocated and offered a template which would govern the outcome.  That was the positive, constructive way to go.</P>
        <P>That is the choice this evening.  We either act before the conference gets going and before there are divisions or else suggest that we will, in the margins, be able to make such a case that when it comes out, it will have brought us to a point where a new principle of international humanitarian law will be satisfied.</P>
        <P>That is a risk we should not take.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I received a legal opinion after the motion in my name and that of Senator Norris was unanimously passed by the foreign affairs committee that legally, we did not need to draft legislation and we could make a statutory instrument which would have an influence.  I also looked at the nature of statutory instruments in that regard.  In 1996, when there was a discussion here, it was possible to make an order under the Explosives Act 1875, which had been transferred through other instruments to current and contemporary law.  It banned the uses of certain kinds of anti-personnel munitions.</P><Col N="354"/>
        <P>We should be clear.  As I have stated, the Fine Gael motion might shy away from tackling issues of real importance and substance but I could deal with these on Committee Stage.  I urge support for Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s Bill this evening and the Labour Party will vote for it.  It should be allowed to proceed to the next stage and I am not at all convinced of the alternative process, namely to form a committee, which would then issue an opinion, which would influence the possible heads of a Bill within nine months.  We are not even offered a conclusion.  The argument is that one should not act as one will influence the conference taking place in Croke Park between 19 May and 30 May next.  However, that is precisely what we want to do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Considering it another way, if we lost an issue of principle we would go to our own committee, preparing legislation with the horse having bolted.  There are agreements between us in issues of principle and the consequence of cluster munitions on the planet, but there is a difference in the political tactics.  Given the experience we have had with the landmines convention and what we know of the process as discussed in this House, we should act in advance to get the best possible outcome.  There is significant public support for securing a total prohibition on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of cluster munitions, and it is incumbent on us to speak clearly and unequivocally on the matter.</P>
        <P>Another point we should stress is the hypocrisy involved in those who sign up to international treaties which on the one hand accept the principle of international jurisprudence with a flourish of rhetoric but at the same time come to a conference seeking such departures from obligation as would enable the defeat of the principle involved.  The use of cluster munitions is one of the great obscenities of our time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has an opportunity to recover the moment to which I refer.  It should be recalled that we find ourselves in circumstances similar to those which obtained during the Ottawa process, when Ireland worked with Norway to save an adequate outcome.  At present, Austria and Belgium have acted in advance.  Belgium is significant because it used to be a producer and supplier of landmines.  The effect of the previous global debate on landmines changed the position to such an extent that Belgium is now one of the two European countries which have taken the initiative on cluster munitions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to comment on the use of cluster munitions, which are notorious in the context of their imprecision.  For example, studies show that they are only 40% effective in the context of exploding immediately after impact.  This means that 60% of these munitions are left lying around to do incredible damage among civilian populations over a long period.  When the debate on landmines took place, Boutros Boutros-Ghali stated that they are weapons of mass destruction in slow motion.  One could almost repeat that statement in respect of cluster munitions, which can be picked up by children long after military conflicts have ended.</P>
        <P>Let us reflect on the jurisprudence involved here.  After a ceasefire, a cessation of hostilities, a potential agreement or the possible definition of territory, part of a landmass can be left unusable for the civilian population, the members of which can be placed at inordinate and indiscriminate risk.  The people to whom I refer are protected by all the international conventions and may not have participated in the original conflict.  That is what is obscene about the cluster munitions and it turns to ashes the arguments of those who use them regarding any of the international treaties they may have signed.</P>
        <P>I agree that it is obscene that funds aimed at providing people with security in their old age should be invested in the production of cluster munitions.  Ireland&rsquo;s hands are not clean.  Those responsible for the National Pension Reserve Fund have already invested &euro;500 million in companies that produce cluster bombs.  I refer here to Raytheon, General Dynamics, 1-3 Communi<Col N="355"/>cations in the United States, EADS in the Netherlands and Thales in France.  If we are serious about banning these munitions, we must halt such investment.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage of the Control of Exports Bill, I referred to the importance of eliminating brokerage.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s assurance that brokerage among those living outside the jurisdiction can be controlled.  Again, however, it is not acceptable to call for the abolition of these munitions while, as has been the case to date through investments made by the National Pensions Reserve Fund, benefiting from their production.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Minister for Foreign Affairs is facilitating the convention that will take place at Croke Park and I pay tribute to him for doing so.  Equally, however, I recognise that the United States, Russia and China will seek exceptions at that convention.  The Minister has already hinted at two exceptions in respect of definitions, which would allow new technological forms that would have the same effect and a period of transition.  If we agree with the moral case and the international legal case and are aware of the consequences, how then can we justify such exceptions?</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I served as a Minister, we received reports from a United Nations debate during which the then Secretary General asked how many more million landmines would be produced and how many more women and children would be put at risk.  Why should a period of transition be needed if one accepts the force of the argument?  Would it not be practical for the Minister to employ this as a template of his definitions and statements regarding universal applicability and adopt it as an opening position for the conference he will host and chair?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Foreign Affairs must explain why he is not using SI 175 of 1966 as a basis for his actions.  I have received legal advice to the effect that this instrument is the fastest possible way to proceed because there is no need to undergo the drafting process.  As regards the enabling legislation relating to the use of such a statutory instrument, this was all discovered when the legislation relating to landmines was debated.</P>
        <P>I disagree with Fine Gael&rsquo;s Bill in the context of the principle of interoperability.  If the universal banning of cluster munitions is to have real moral purchase, we must insist on the principle of interoperability.  In that context, no Irish troops should work in partnership with troops from countries which continue to defend the use of such munitions.  That is the position of the Labour Party and it would form the basis of any legislation I would draft.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The concept of interoperability is important.  As already stated, the concept of universalisation was utilised 12 years ago in the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel mines.  This refers to the fact that in the event of the creation of an international instrument seeking to abolish the production, stockpiling and so forth of landmines, not all nations in the international community will join from day one and many will join later.  A refusal by those nations that are signatories to engage and interact with any nations which did sign meant that matters became difficult and the position became morally reprehensible.  That is the meaning of the stigma that attached to the use of landmines after a significant achievement had been made.  Those countries that continue to use cluster munitions should be rightly regarded as pariahs among states with anything like a concept of moral politics.</P>
        <P>Should the Bill proceed to Committee Stage &mdash; I hope this will prove to be the case &mdash; I will table amendments that reflect the principles contained in the motion which Senator Norris and I tabled at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  These principles relate to a total prohibition on cluster munitions, national law, research, publication awareness and the role taken by Ireland on advancing jurisprudence in this area and in those of mine-risk education, the treatment of casualties etc.  I compliment Deputy Timmins on suggesting the introduction of an absolute prohibition on investment in any company involved in cluster munitions production. <Col N="356"/> Included under this prohibition should be the activities of companies involved in advanced technological or scientific research that does not have a direct connection to such production.</P>
        <P>There is only one way to be moral in the context of legislation relating to the control of exports.  I refer here to the point at which we become able to discover and define end use.  If one can identify this point, one will then know whose hands are dirty or have blood on them because they were involved at either an intellectual and technological or a practical level.</P>
        <P>Cluster munitions do not discriminate among their victims.  There are no cluster bombs that can guarantee anybody&rsquo;s safety.  They are an abomination and an obscenity and are like a scar on the face of humanity.  That is the reason the prohibition should be universal and should allow no escape by way of subtlety of definition.  The Government, even if it does not want to accept the Bill, should at this stage consider using the statutory instrument procedure to enter the conference in a strong position and provide a lead.  If they were willing to accept Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s Bill I would be glad to work with everybody on Committee Stage to make sure the Bill represents model legislation rather than waiting, as the amendment suggests, until it is all over and then, nine months later, realising that we have the heads of a Bill.  No idea of completeness or anything similar would justify having missed the opportunity of succeeding on such an important issue about which many members of the public are concerned.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the NGOs who have worked on this, such as Pax Christi, and particularly Mr. D&rsquo;Costa.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue.  I note that the Minister of State with responsibility for this area is not here.  I hope there is a good reason for this and it is not part of the ongoing policy of Ministers to ignore issues raised on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>The P&aacute;ist&iacute; le Ch&eacute;ile project is an inter-agency pilot initiative run through Roscommon County Childcare Committee.  It has been funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform since March 2006 and this funding will continue up to June of this year.  The objective of P&aacute;ist&iacute; le Ch&eacute;ile is to enhance the level and quality of access for children with special needs to mainstream child care services within the county.  The project works collaboratively with parents, pre-school practitioners, the HSE, the Brothers of Charity services and other voluntary organisations within the county.  The four main objectives of the project are the provision of support workers to children with special needs and-or disabilities so that they can attend pre-schools; the provision of disability-related training to pre-school workers and parents; the development of protocols for inter-agency working; and the development of an information resource pack on disability and child care services.</P>
        <P>This innovative pilot project provides individualised support to 19 children, enabling them to attend and be included in their local pre-schools.  Without this service, these children with learning difficulties would have to rely on the current non-existent HSE service and would, in the long term, put significant demand on the HSE paramedical specialties.  In County Roscommon, there is a large waiting list and no availability of such specialists.  There would also be significant additional demands in terms of the support needed for these children within <Col N="357"/>the mainstream educational system.  We are talking about children with a learning difficulty but not those who would fit into the category of intellectual disability.  These children are already provided for by the Brothers of Charity and funding is available for them.</P>
        <P>This project represents a win-win situation.  From a purely financial perspective, it would save significant current spending on such children in our overstretched health and education systems.  From a personal perspective, the programme has had a dramatic effect in helping the children involved to meet their developmental milestones.  The P&aacute;ist&iacute; le Ch&eacute;ile project has provided training for up to 158 pre-school practitioners in disability awareness, behavioural support, child development and communication, including sign language.</P>
        <P>When I raised this issue with the Minister of State with responsibility for children through a parliamentary question on 11 March, he washed his hands of the issue, stating that Roscommon County Childcare Committee had received funding of &euro;295,000 for 2008 and would have to find the money from its existing budget.  This is totally unacceptable.  As the Minister of State knows, Roscommon County Childcare Committee submitted a case for the P&aacute;ist&iacute; le Ch&eacute;ile project as part of its actions for 2008, with a budget of &euro;51,000 to continue the programme to the end of 2008.  The child care committee was asked by the Minister of State to remain within its indicative budget for 2008 so it has no option but to remove the funding sought for the P&aacute;ist&iacute; le Ch&eacute;ile project.  However, the yearly budget currently received by the child care committee only covers salaries, with a small amount remaining for specific actions identified in the strategic child care plan.  That money would not provide for the continuation of the project.  It is well known to the Minister that the funding is not there within the existing budget as that money is already committed.</P>
        <P>The cost of continuing this project for a full academic year is approximately &euro;150,000 and inquiries are already being received for September of this year.  There is at present a waiting list of 12 children who have applied for support, and more referrals are anticipated.  The evaluation currently being submitted to the Minister of State with responsibility for children clearly shows the success of this pilot project.  If the child care budget is not the appropriate avenue, the Minister of State has two other possible sources of funding, through either the Department of Health and Children or the Department of Education and Science, within his control and he should use one of those to fund and mainstream this valuable project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith, who is unavoidably absent as he had another engagement outside the city in an area under his responsibility.  He asked me to convey his apologies to Deputy Naughten.</P>
        <P>To respond to the Deputy, it is necessary first to give a brief explanation of the equal opportunities child care programme and the national child care investment programme, for which the Minister for Health and Children is responsible.  The programme for Government and the progress of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06, EOCP, and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-10, NCIP, represent confirmation of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing child care services to support the child care needs of the parents of Ireland.  The EOCP, which has now concluded, had both an equal opportunities and a social inclusion perspective and aimed to increase the supply of centre-based child care places by 55%, or an additional 31,300 places, by the end of the programme.  This target was exceeded, with some 39,000 additional places created by the programme.</P>
        <P>In order to build on the success of the EOCP, the Government introduced the NCIP to cover the period 2006 to 2010.  This programme will build on the success of the EOCP and incorporates a number of key objectives.  It will increase the supply and quality of early child<Col N="358"/>hood care and education services across the board.  It will support families in breaking the cycle of disadvantage and provide a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care that is centred on the needs of the child.  The decision of the Government to create a major new investment programme immediately, rather than waiting until the previous programme had expired, is evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to drive progress in the child care field.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NCIP has a funding allocation of &euro;575 million and aims to create an additional 50,000 child care places.  It is expected that approximately 22,000 of these places will be in the private sector and 28,000 in the community and not-for-profit sector.  A total of 20% of the overall places will be for children in the three to four year age group and will provide an early childhood care and education focus.  When considered with the other child care measures introduced by this Government, such as increases in paid and unpaid maternity leave and the introduction of the early childhood supplement, now worth &euro;1,100 per year per child under six, and tax relief for childminders, no one can doubt that the Government is giving this issue the priority it deserves.</P>
        <P>I turn now to the matter in question this evening.</P>
        <P>The P&aacute;ist&iacute; le Ch&eacute;ile project in County Roscommon was a pilot&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>A very successful pilot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the enhancing disabilities services programme.  The Office of the Minister for Children provides funding on an annual basis to support activities set out in the action plans of the 33 city and county child care committees.  The total funding provided to the 33 committees to support their action plan activities this year amounts to &euro;13.3 million, which represents an increase of more than 7%.</P>
        <P>In 2008, funding amounting to &euro;295,360 has been approved for the Roscommon county child care committee to enhance quality in child care in the county.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>But nothing for P&aacute;ist&iacute; le Ch&eacute;ile.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>On a <i>per capita</i> basis, this is one of the highest allocations in the country.  Many child care services throughout Roscommon have benefited from grant assistance under both programmes.  To date, funding of more than &euro;10 million has been approved for child care in Roscommon under both child care programmes.  Funding provided under the EOCP supported the provision of 579 new child care places and also supported 376 existing places in the county up until the end of 2007. </P>
        <P>The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06 was central to the development of child care in Ireland.  The Government expects that the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-10 will be equally effective.  The substantial investment provided under these programmes demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the ongoing development of child care.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The background to this matter concerns whether there is a level below which guarantees concerning health will be made to Irish citizens.  Professor Drumm seems to be operating a system which is based entirely on a business model.  He says he must function within an allocation and, in order to meet it, will let staff go if necessary.  What happened in Galway is a dramatic anticipation of that.  For example, this morning the number of patients awaiting admission to the emergency department at University College Hospital <Col N="359"/>Galway hit an all-time high with 40 patients on trolleys.  Six of those had intravenous infusions and had to be treated in the public waiting room of the accident and emergency unit.</P>
        <P>I support the statement issued earlier today by the Irish Nurses Organisation, which made the point that yesterday two nurses were expected to assess 96 patients who checked in between 1 p.m. and 8 p.m.  Who is responsible for this situation?  Is it Professor Drumm, the Minister, the HSE or the Department of Health and Children?  Whoever it is, they are responsible for allowing health care to sink to a level at which professional standards cannot be sustained.  This is a most serious matter.  University College Hospital Galway simply ran out of space.</P>
        <P>I recall that a former Attorney General ruled that the Minister is responsible for the minimum care of every citizen.  It is not a delegable responsibility, so she must answer for this.  In my view, Professor Drumm is not free to operate the model he is currently operating, which includes 40 patients on trolleys in Galway.  Shamefully, in many cases, there are no cubicles for patients who are accommodated on trolleys, and no space for them in the hospital corridors.  Therefore, there is no privacy or any concept of a minimum level of dignity.  In addition, nurses are being asked to compromise their professional standards.  To its credit, the INO says it cannot stand over the quality of care it delivers to patients in such circumstances.  The INO further states that such things are happening daily in our hospitals.</P>
        <P>Over a long period, I have received unsolicited e-mails from the HSE telling me about the number of people waiting in accident and emergency units practically all over the country.  I do not want to receive such e-mails, but I do want to know who is guaranteeing the minimum standards in situations such as the one I have described.  Will the Minister accept responsibility?  Will she intervene through the Department under the HSE, not only regarding accident and emergency units but also concerning respite care and home helps?  The Government will be held accountable in this House to provide a basic, minimum service.  Those affected in Galway were very patient yesterday.  Most of those who witnessed what took place accepted that there had been breaches of the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s guidelines.  They also accepted that the staff were doing their best.  They are hard workers but should not be put in such a position.  At midday today, after I had submitted this matter for discussion on the Adjournment, there were 25 patients awaiting admission at the accident and emergency unit in Galway.</P>
        <P>Professor Drumm should get out of the way if he is obstructing decent standards in hospitals.  The Minister has a constitutional and legal responsibility to this House.  She never got the right to transfer and delegate responsibility for basic minimum health standards to anybody else.</P>

	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  She has asked me to apologise to Deputy Michael D. Higgins as she is unable to attend the House at this time.  </P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that University College Hospital Galway has been extremely busy over the past 24 hours or so.  Deputy Higgins has provided information to the House in this respect.  The HSE has also advised that the hospital put in place a contingency plan to address these pressures in order to ensure that all patients are accommodated today and that no patient is required to wait more than 24 hours for admission.</P>
        <P>The HSE has also advised that it has made significant progress at University College Hospital Galway by improving the discharge planning process and increasing the uptake on day care in line with the findings of the bed utilisation review commissioned by the HSE.</P>

        <P>In terms of waiting times, a revised target of 12 hours waiting, from decision to admit, was introduced in October last year.  This built on an initial maximum target waiting time of 24 hours.  The HSE has advised that the majority of patients in the accident and emergency unit at University College Hospital Galway have been admitted within 12 hours since the 12-hour target was introduced.  The HSE is also committed to monitoring and reporting on the total length of time patients spend in emergency departments, irrespective of whether they are admitted.  A number of hospitals have commenced reporting this information and the HSE expects to be in a position to publish data on up to 18 hospitals in the next few months.</P>

	<P>The HSE is also working closely with those hospitals that are experiencing difficulties in meeting waiting time targets.  The focus is on improving and streamlining hospital processes and patient pathways to ensure that care is provided in a more timely, appropriate and efficient manner.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Targeted initiatives include setting up consultant-led clinical decision units and acute short stay units with a dedicated number of beds and integrated discharge planning implemented on a seven-day basis, including nurse facilitated discharges.</P>

	<P>Other targeted initiatives include updating the bed management system and processes with a focus on improved discharge planning, reducing inappropriate referrals from GPs to emergency departments, reducing admissions with the duty medical registrar deciding on admissions, standardising assessment processes and enhancing diagnostic capacity.</P><Col N="361"/>
        <P>The initiatives I have described are designed to free up capacity during 2008 to allow for more timely admissions to emergency departments and further movement towards a lower target of six hours waiting time from the decision to admit.</P>
        <P>This is the aspiration and we hope to achieve it.  I note the very strong case Deputy Higgins has made regarding the number of patients on trolleys in University College Hospital, Galway, and the number of nurses who deal with the waiting patients.  I do not doubt his assertion that two nurses deal with 96 patients.  I will bring his strongly held views to both the Minister and the Health Service Executive shortly.

	<P>On 6 February the Minister announced he was commissioning an independent study on the national transmission line infrastructure.  Subsequently, his Department set a deadline of 29 February for the receipt of tenders from potential consultants and announced 7 March as the deadline for receipt of submissions from interested parties to the consultants.  The Department&rsquo;s offer for tenders indicated that 40 days would be allowed for completion of the study and that it would be completed by the end of May.</P>
        <P>We are now at 8 April and it has taken until today for the Minister to officially announce the name of the consultants who will carry out this extremely important study.  It has taken the Minister and his Department two months to come up with a name and that is an unacceptable delay for the people I represent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If I had not pressed for this adjournment matter this evening, would the Minister have continued to put the announcement on the long finger?  I note that the consultants appointed are Ecofys from the Netherlands, assisted by Golder Associates from Canada.  These companies are well respected in their fields and I wish to put on the record that they are collaborating closely as joint venture partners in a number of other countries.  Ecofys operates in the area of wind power generation and Golder Associates in engineering and environmental works.  Neither company, however, has expertise in the construction and management of overground or underground high power electricity lines.</P>
        <P>Ecofys acted as consultants on a major section of the all-island grid study commissioned by, and recently completed for, the Department.  Given the study&rsquo;s recommendation that more than 600 km of the high power lines of the grid will have to be strengthened, as EirGrid now proposes in the north east, it could be perceived that the independence and impartiality of Ecofys to carry out this study on the underground versus overground issue is compromised.  On the face of the known facts, there is a conflict of interest.</P>
        <P>I have a number of questions to ask the Minister.  Will he accept that the appointment of Ecofys, assisted by Golder Associates, means the study will lack the necessary expertise and experience to do a proper job?  Ecofys worked on the final report of the all-island grid study, which is the basis on which EirGrid is proceeding with its pylons proposal.  Therefore, one would have to question the independence and impartiality of Ecofys to carry out this study.  I note that the Minister is citing early June as the date for completion of the study but this is a ludicrously tight deadline for completion of this massive, complex undertaking.  More than 500 members of the public and interested parties sent submissions to the Minister&rsquo;s Department <Col N="362"/>for consideration by the consultants.  Would the Minister agree that to even read those 500 submissions properly would take up to early June?</P>
        <P>There is still time for the Minister to get this right as it is better to get it done right than to get it done quickly.  Too much is at stake here for the people of Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.  The Minister must re-advertise for a properly qualified firm of international consultants to carry out this study and he must allow far more than 40 days for its completion.  Until it is completed, the Minister must instruct EirGrid not to proceed with any further planning or preparation on this project.</P>
        <P>Two months ago we discussed this matter with the Minister and for four weeks the people of Meath, Cavan and Monaghan came here and felt they would be part of this process.  To read of it in a newspaper two weeks ago was an insult to all of those involved and to the work of this House.  It is wrong that it was necessary to force the Minister to make a statement today.  It is unacceptable that stakeholders were not consulted and I call on the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Tony Killeen, to ask the Minister to contact the north-east pylon pressure group and EirGrid to have them engage in discussions in the same room.  This matter should not be allowed to drag on for eight to ten years but it seems that may happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague Deputy Shane McEntee for allowing me part of his time to speak on this extremely important issue.  As one who was involved in debate with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, I am disappointed that no consultation took place between the north-east pylon pressure group and the Minister before the consultancy group was announced.</P>
        <P>The campaign group is a very reasonable and pragmatic collection of people who are genuinely concerned about their futures and the futures of their family members, who will have to live near or adjacent to the proposed line through counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan into Northern Ireland as a cross-Border interconnector.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I understood that independent consultants that had no previous involvement with EirGrid would be appointed, however it seems that the very company appointed by the Minister has had clear involvement in the recent study carried out on behalf of the Government, the all-island grid study.  This is the very study that recommended more than 600 km of high grid power lines.  They have already decided that the lines should go over ground.  It would seem at this stage, if these are the facts, that there would clearly be a conflict of interest.  It is very difficult to understand how a company such as this could in 40 days deal with all the submissions supplied to it, never mind carry out a detailed study of what it would actually cost to put the cable underground.</P>
        <P>Even at this late stage I call on the Minister, together with his officials, to meet the people representing the owners of the land and property in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath before this study goes ahead.  Clearly if this is not done other studies will be carried out, legal cases will ensue and the much needed cross-Border link will be delayed.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Ryan, made a breakthrough when he said he would introduce an independent study.  It is now up to him to meet the people concerned in the north-east pylon pressure group and EirGrid and find an amicable solution.  I urge the Minister to deal with this matter in the manner he dealt with us in the committee.  I believe he can find a reasonable solution but this approach will not solve the problem.</P>

	<P>My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural <Col N="363"/>Resources, Deputy Ryan, announced earlier today that he has appointed international consultants Ecofys to undertake the independent study on the comparative merits of overhead electricity transmission lines versus underground cables.  The consultants were appointed following a tender process launched on 29 February on the Government&rsquo;s eTenders website.  Ecofys, which is based in the Netherlands, with offices in 12 different countries worldwide, specialises in energy saving and renewable energy solutions.</P>
        <P>Ecofys will also utilise the services of Golder Associates, a global group of consulting companies specialising in ground engineering and environmental services.  Golder has provided environmental consultancy services for a range of electricity generation and transmission related projects in Ireland and the UK.</P>
        <P>The planning, development and routing of transmission line infrastructure is a matter for EirGrid, which is a wholly State-owned company.  EirGrid has responsibility for operating the electricity transmission system in Ireland, including the wholesale electricity trading system.  It delivers connections, transmission and market services to generators, suppliers and customers, using the high voltage electricity system.  It is also responsible for planning the construction of high voltage transmission lines.</P>
        <P>In the course of EirGrid&rsquo;s pre-planning public consultations on proposed routes for the North-South and Meath-Cavan transmission lines, concerns were expressed locally about the impacts of overhead transmission lines.  Noting that these concerns are likely to be common to all transmission line projects, and in order to provide clarity on issues in relation to overhead versus underground transmission lines, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, decided that the Department would commission an independent national study on this issue.  In doing so, he was also taking account of the views of Deputies from all sides of the House.</P>
        <P>The aim of the study is to provide further clarity and information on all of the issues in relation to underground cables and overhead lines.  In so doing, we can help inform decisions on all current and future transmission line projects.  As part of its ongoing transmission development plan, and in line with the Government&rsquo;s energy policy White Paper, EirGrid is currently planning the construction and reinforcement of a number of transmission lines.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recently published all-island grid study also estimated the transmission infrastructure investments needed to accommodate increasing levels of renewable electricity and affirmed that up to 42% renewable energy is potentially feasible, requiring over 600 km of additional transmission lines.  EirGrid is also finalising a long-term grid development strategy to 2025 which will set out plans for the next two decades.</P>
        <P>The Ecofys study is to be conducted on a national basis.  Its purpose is to provide the best available professional advice on the relative merits of constructing and operating overhead transmission lines compared to underground cables.  It will have regard to technical characteristics, reliability, operation and maintenance factors, environmental impact, possible health issues and cost.</P>
        <P>The consultants have been specifically asked to provide professional advice covering a review of electrical power transmission technologies currently in use for transmission of electricity of 110 kV and above.  They will examine the factual position regarding current practice for constructing transmission lines worldwide, including circumstances in which lines are constructed as underground cables.  They will also assess the relative technical performance of overhead lines and underground cables.  Technical considerations include losses, reliability, quality, security of supply and electromagnetic field generation.  The study will compare relative capital costs, total life cycle costs, annualised operation and maintenance costs, and impact on unit electricity prices of both options.  It will also examine the construction times and consequential impacts on security of supply of both options.</P><Col N="364"/>
        <P>The consultants will also assess in detail the comparative environmental impacts of both options.  They will examine possible impacts on land use, geology and soils, and water resources.  In addition, they will assess visual impact, effects on ecology and nature conservation and on air quality.  They have also been asked to consider impacts on traffic, noise levels, tourism and communities.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the tender process, the Department placed advertisements in nine national newspapers requesting submissions from the public on the issue.  Over 500 submissions were received by the closing date of 7 March.  The consultants have been furnished with these submissions and will consider points raised in their analysis of the merits or otherwise of underground and overground options.  The consultants will also be available to meet with the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, to discuss the details of the report, once published.</P>
        <P>We expect that the report will be finalised by early June.  The timeframe for completion is in line with the tender specification.</P>

	<P>The level of tariff reduction commitments to be applied in the next WTO Round are still the subject of the ongoing negotiations.  These tariff reduction commitments are only one of a significant number of outstanding issues in these negotiations. The Chair of the WTO Agriculture Committee issued his latest draft agriculture modalities paper in February 2008. This paper outlines the methodology for tariff reductions and the range of tariff reductions which are currently under consideration.  The tariff reduction formula provides for four bands of tariffs grouping the products with the lowest current tariffs in the bottom band and those with the highest current tariffs in the top band.  The formula also provides for higher reductions for products in the top tariff band, that is the products with the highest current tariffs.</P>
        <P>The Chair&rsquo;s text proposes tariff reductions of between 66% and 73% for tariff lines in the highest tariff band.  In terms of the EU tariff structure the highest tariff band includes beef, butter and some sheep tariff lines. If this level of tariff reduction were applied in full it would represent a huge challenge on the EU market for EU production of these products which are competing with third country imports.</P>
        <P>The tariff reduction formula is one element of the agriculture market access negotiations.  The Chair&rsquo;s text also provides for the designation by each WTO member country of a certain number of tariff lines as so called &lsquo;sensitive products&rsquo;.  The Chair states the number of lines which could be designated as sensitive should be in the range of 4-6% of total tariff lines.  This <Col N="366"/>designation provides for a reduction of up to two thirds from the tariff reduction which would normally apply under the proposed tariff reduction formula.  However sensitive product designation also involves the creation of new Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs). These new TRQs will be calculated for each product designated as sensitive on the basis of a percentage of domestic consumption of those products.  The detailed methodology and level of these TRQs is also still the subject of ongoing negotiation, and the outcome of these discussions will therefore have a strong influence on any decision to declare sensitive products status for a particular product.</P>
        <P>As I have outlined, there are a significant number of outstanding issues which are the subject of the ongoing negotiations in relation to import tariffs. The manner in which sensitive products are dealt with will be crucial to the access debate.</P>
        <P>The outcome of this facet of the negotiations represents a key priority for me. I fully recognize the importance of the EU market for Irish agricultural exports and I will therefore be seeking to ensure that the outcome to these negotiations does not undermine this crucial and key market for Irish products.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.   </P>
        <P>As regards meat and meat products, EU beef labelling legislation requiring country of origin labelling of beef has been in place since September 2000.  As this legislation did not cover beef sold by the catering trade I collaborated with the Minister for Health &amp; Children to have national legislation enacted to require that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is also enforced by the FSAI.</P>
        <P>In relation to poultry meat, there are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultrymeat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.   The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  However, it indicated that it will reconsider the draft measures once we have submitted additional explanatory information.  This information is currently being prepared for transmission to the Commission.  I will continue to press for progress, as I believe consumers are entitled to full information on the labelling of food products.</P>

	<P>In December 2006 the Government and Industry both welcomed the launch of the strategy for a restructured, sustainable and profitable Irish seafood industry for the period 2007 to 2013. More commonly known as the Cawley Report, it set out the strategy and recommendations which are now very much Government policy and which have my full and wholehearted support. A very important part of this strategy of course includes the development of the aquaculture industry to its full potential. To ensure its implementation, I established the Seafood Strategy Implementation Group (SSIG) under the chairmanship of Dr Cawley himself and I am very pleased to inform you this group has been very active in the last year. </P>
        <P>The Cawley Report recognised the key challenges facing the aquaculture sector as:</P>
         <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The current licensing and regulatory regime</P>
         <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Prevention/control/monitoring of disease outbreaks/biotoxins</P>
         <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Improved marketing performance on the basis of eco-quality and innovative products.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Report clearly identified a market led opportunity for aquaculture derived seafood products to fill the widening gap between supply and demand particularly with the constraints on the capture fishery under TAC&rsquo;s and quotas. The key focus areas were identified as Marine and Freshwater Farmed Finfish, Bottom and Rope Grown Mussels and Pacific Oysters.</P>
        <P>The Cawley Report envisages a 30% increase in the value of the output of the Irish seafood sector, from its current value of &euro;702 million to &euro;911 million in 2015. This projected increase is calculated on the basis that there will be a 54% increase in the volume of farmed shellfish and a doubling of the volume of farmed finfish.</P>
        <P>At EU level a review process in relation to the aquaculture industry is already in hand and is at a reasonably advanced stage. DG MARE, the directorate of the EU Commission with responsibility for fish and shellfish farming, is currently engaged in an extensive review and consultative process with a view to bringing forward a revised policy and strategy for the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector in Europe. The issue of the trade imbalance of seafood imports is an integral part of the process and the Commission have stated that it is a priority to attempt to improve the current situation.</P>
        <P>Ireland is actively participating in this process and officials and industry representatives attended a major conference on the new EU strategy at the end of last year.</P>

	<P>It is difficult to be definitive on the question of adequacy of meat supplies in the long-term as there are many variables at play in addition to feed costs. The variables include population growth, consumer tastes, climate change and land use. These will influence both supply and demand. For the medium-term, however, the FAPRI outlook for EU and Irish agriculture, published in October 2007, provides some useful projections for meat production up to 2016: </P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />There will be a gradual decrease in indigenous EU beef production of the order of 7% over the projected period.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />In the sheep sector, a 6% decline in EU meat output leading to an increase in lamb imports of almost 9% is forecast.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />EU pigmeat production will likely increase by 4% which, combined with lower export volumes, will leave the Community more than self sufficient in this sector.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Poultry output is forecast to increase by almost 5% in the EU and all the indications are for strong growth in imports also.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Overall, it is expected that the EU meat market will remain in equilibrium through a combination of adjusted domestic production and imports.  There is no evidence at this stage to support the view that there will be a scarcity of meat. Recent reforms of the Common Agriculture Policy mean that the food industry is better positioned to respond to actual market demand and I believe that a satisfactory market balance will be found in the meat sector.</P>
        <P>In the specific Irish context, it is, of course, the case that our beef production is generally grass based and is consequently less affected by feed price increases. Furthermore, Ireland is a significant beef exporter, exporting in 2007 over 90% of our production, making us the largest net beef exporter in Europe and this is likely to remain the case.</P>
        <P>Feed costs have no doubt become a big issue for the intensive pig and poultry production sectors in the past year.  In line with the general increases in prices of commodities world wide, Irish tillage farmers have benefited from an increase in the price of cereals of at least 50% during the last 12 months. The price of certain imported feed materials has increased by as much as 80%. This has resulted in compound feed prices that are 30% ahead than at the same time last year. Increased cereal planting consequent on the modification of set-aside rules should result in an easing of prices for native grains from the 2008 harvest, but prices are expected to be still well above the level that prevailed in 2006.  Import duties have been abolished on certain feedstuffs coming from non-EU countries and it is hoped that this will also add to feed availability.</P><Col N="370"/>
        <P>I have taken action to address the difficulties being experienced by pig producers with a view to maintaining a strong production base here. With support from like-minded colleagues, I succeeded in having EU support measures introduced. An aids-to private storage scheme was available during November 2007 and a scheme of export refunds is currently in place. These have resulted in improved prices.</P>
        <P>This question brings into focus the whole issue of food security. It is an important issue for the global agriculture economy and is one that will no doubt attract growing attention in the decades ahead.  While I do not believe that there is a cause for concern at this stage this is an area we need to be mindful of in our consideration of the future direction of the CAP.  The correct environment needs to be in place to encourage farmers everywhere to produce an adequate supply of safe food in a manner that is consistent with good animal welfare and environmental protection standards and the marketplace must reward these farmers in a satisfactory manner.</P>

        <Quest> if her Department has carried out analysis of the economic impact on the Irish beef industry of the decision to re-open Brazilian beef markets to the EU; if she has received copies of reports outlining the result of the most recent FVO visits to Brazil; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>In 2007 Brazil exported some 360,000 tonnes to the EU.  The current position is that less than 100 farms are approved to export to the EU. It is not possible for us to assess the % of exports that these farms constitute but it is widely accepted as being very small. A formal economic analysis has not been carried out nor would it be feasible.  The sector has performed well over recent months with prices up 12% for steers, 11% for heifers and 15% for cows.</P>
        <P>The Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) has prepared its report on the most recent mission it carried out to Brazil from 6 to 9 November 2007 to evaluate animal health controls in place in that country, in particular over foot and mouth disease and public health control systems and certification systems. I understand that the report will shortly be made available on its website.</P>
        <P>Following on from the FVO&rsquo;s initial findings on this mission the Commission identified serious instances of non-compliance with regard to holding registration, animal identification and movement control and a failure to take corrective actions following commitments given to the FVO at earlier missions undertaken since 2003. While public health controls were considered to be adequate the Commission considered urgent measures were necessary to protect animal and public health in the face of these shortcomings.</P>
        <P>In December the Commission introduced a proposal at the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH) providing additional certification requirements as to the origin of beef for export to the EU. This requires that beef originates on holdings that provide for full identification and registration of animals under the national system and which are under veterinary control. The Commission&rsquo;s proposals seek to guarantee that exports to the EU originate from :</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Bovine animals from holdings where animals have not been introduced from non-approved areas in Brazil during 90 days,</P><Col N="371"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />That they are identified and registered in the national identification system for bovine animals,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />That the holdings are listed as approved holdings, following a favourable inspection and report by the Competent Authority, in TRACES and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Inspections are regularly carried out by the competent authority to ensure that the relevant requirements for export to the EU are assured.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I consider these arrangements, which included provisions to maintain exports to the EU for a transitional period, did not appropriately address shortcomings and risks identified in the previous missions and instructed my officials to vote against the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to introduce more restrictive measures rather than a complete ban.</P>
        <P>In the period since the end of the transitional period on 15 March 2008 the relative absence of confirmations by the Brazilian competent authorities of holdings that are operating to these requirements would indicate it will be some time before these issues can be resolved. The Commission&rsquo;s recent audit of some of the holdings submitted for listing as meeting EU export requirements has also confirmed this.</P>
        <P>My Department has received the report of the November 2007 FVO visit to Brazil and has requested the EU Commission to place it on the agenda of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.</P>

	<P>A clear disparity does not exist between Irish and EU pigmeat prices and Irish pigmeat prices have been both above and below the EU average over recent months. The EU pigmeat sector as a whole has been experiencing difficulties. For my part, I have taken significant action to help alleviate the problem. </P>
        <P>I have worked with my EU Ministerial colleagues to put in place measures aimed at improving the income situation of pig farmers and ameliorating some of the difficulties being caused by the increased cost of inputs. Increased production of cereals is expected on foot of the modification of set-aside rules, and import duties have been abolished on certain feedstuffs.</P>
        <P>Steps have also been taken to support the pigmeat market. These consist of an aids-to private storage scheme that was available during November and exports refunds for fresh and frozen pork which are still available.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has prepared a development strategy for the Irish pig industry which identified the issues facing the sector and makes certain recommendations. A group, which includes representation from my Department, has been established for the purpose of furthering those recommendations.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the requirement to publish details of EU payments to farmers. Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and its implementing regulations, require my Department, as the EU paying agency, to publish on its web site, commencing this year, certain details of beneficiaries of schemes funded or co-funded by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Rural Development Fund (EAFRD). These regulations are directly applicable in all EU Member States and binding in their entirety. At the time I did not support this measure at EU level and sought the imposition of a threshold beneath which publication would not take place. My view, which I expressed strongly to the Commission was that this would better reflect the farming context in which the payments are made. However there was little support for this.</P>
        <P>The details which will be published will be the beneficiary&rsquo;s name, the address line immediately preceding County on the Department&rsquo;s client database and payments funded or co-funded by the EAGF and/or EAFRD.</P>
        <P>Details in respect of EAFRD expenditure between 1 January and 15 October 2007 must be published by Member States no later than 30 September 2008.  This will cover payments made under the Rural Environment Protection, Early Retirement and Compensatory Allowance in Less Favoured Areas Schemes.</P>
        <P>Details in respect of EAGF and EAFRD expenditure between 16 October 2007 and 15 October 2008 must be published no later than 30 April 2009.

	<P>I am fully committed to ensuring that consumers can have full confidence in the organic food they buy.  For that reason my Department has assigned additional resources to the Organic Unit and they are now systematically inspecting retail outlets, including supermarkets, shops and farmers markets, checking to ensure that all product identified as organic has been produced fully in accordance with the organic regulations.  </P>
        <P>The introduction of the European Communities (Organic Farming) Regulation 2004 (S.I. No 112 of 2004) gave my Department powers to prosecute contraventions of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2092/91 on organic production and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs.  This Statutory Instrument was amended in October 2007 to grant <Col N="373"/>significant additional statutory powers to my Department officials to enable them to carry out their work in a more effective manner.  To date two prosecutions have been successfully brought for labelling product in contravention of these Regulations.  In addition, there have been two recent seizures of incorrectly labelled produce.</P>

	<P>Changes in food prices are primarily a function of market forces operating at international, EU and national levels. Consistently strong economic growth in developing countries is the main driver of changing world food demand towards high-value agricultural products and processed foods.  Slow-growing supply, low stocks, and supply shocks at a time of increasing demand for feed, food and fuel have led to price increases globally. Biofuel production has also contributed to the changing world food equation. In common with the EU, Ireland is not impervious to this evolving change in context.</P>
        <P>In addition, rising input costs, at both producer and processor levels have fed through to put upward pressure on food prices. Pressure on input prices, in particular energy and raw material including feed costs, has combined with strong competition on world dairy and cereal markets in increasing producer prices.</P>
        <P>The most recent annual data available from the Central Statistics Office relates to 2007 when food and non-alcoholic beverages prices, as measured by the food price index, increased by 2.8% on average for that year. This is a lower level of increase than the overall annual rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, which averaged 4.9% during the same year. More recent monthly data, for February 2008 indicate that food and non-alcoholic beverage prices increased by 1.8% in the month and by 8.5% in the year to February 2008. This compares to an increase of 1.1% for the year to February 2007 and mirrors the upward trajectory in food prices as evidenced globally and across Europe throughout 2007 and into 2008.</P>
        <P>In response to this situation the EU Council of agriculture Ministers has suspended set-aside, in order to increase cereal production, and has recently agreed a 2% increase in milk quota for 2008. Further measures are being considered in the context of the current discussions on the &lsquo;&lsquo;Health Check&rsquo;&rsquo; of the CAP.</P>

        <Quest> if she will lobby the European Commission to rescind the decision to pay REP scheme four retrospectively to participating farmers; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The arrangements for REPS 4 are derived from a new Commission Regulation which reflects the Commission&rsquo;s objective of integrating and harmonising the operation of the various farm payment schemes &mdash; including the Single Payment Scheme, REPS and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.  For REPS 4, this means that applications to join the Scheme must be submitted by 15 May each year.  Payments will relate to the number of months in a year during which the farmer is in a REPS 4 contract, and they will be released in two phases of 75% and 25%.</P><Col N="374"/>
        <P>The arrangements I announced recently emerged from intensive discussions between my officials and their counterparts in the Commission.  In these discussions, my officials pointed out that the previous arrangements had worked well since REPS was first introduced in 1994 and had contributed to the success of the scheme, with nearly 60,000 farmers participating in REPS 2 and REPS 3 by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>The Commission were adamant, however, that the new Regulation must apply to REPS 4.  The discussions therefore focused on how to apply the new arrangements in a way that mitigated as far as possible any inconvenience they would create for farmers.  It was in this context that the Commission agreed to special transitional arrangements for farmers in REPS 2 finishing their contracts during 2008.  As long as these farmers have submitted an application for REPS by the new closing date of 15 May this year, they can submit their farm plans after that date and still receive payment during the year.  My officials have written to every farmer in this category to tell them what they need to do.</P>
        <P>This was a significant concession by the Commission.  If they had not agreed to these special transitional arrangements at a late stage in the discussions, farmers finishing their REPS 2 contracts this year would have had to get their farm plans submitted by 15 May or else wait until 2009 to join REPS 4.  The Commission insisted however that the new Regulation must apply strictly to all other farmers joining REPS 4 in 2008, and to everyone joining the new Scheme from next year on.</P>
        <P>Although payments will now come at different times of the year from those that farmers are used to, no farmer will lose out on his or her payments in REPS 4.  Nevertheless I am aware that the 15 May deadline for applications, and the departure from the existing practice of paying farmers in full at an early point in each year of their REPS contracts, are significant changes.  I believe the previous way of doing things was better, but we are constrained by the Regulations.  I hope that planners, both within Teagasc and in the private sector, will do what they can to accommodate farmers who want to enter REPS 4 this year.  I have asked my officials to make every effort to explain the new rules clearly both to farmers and to planners, and to be as flexible as possible in implementing them.</P>
        <P>Finally I want to reiterate that there is no change to the rules governing REPS 2 and REPS 3.  For the remainder of their time in these Schemes, farmers will continue to be paid in full at an early stage in each year of their contracts.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the specific measures she will introduce in the agricultural sector to meet Ireland&rsquo;s national target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 3% per year; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13015/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The achievement of the 3% target calls for action by all sectors, not just agriculture. I believe that farmers are already playing their part in addressing this challenge and my Department is, and will continue to be, fully supportive of their efforts.  In particular, we will continue funding various schemes which contribute to the reduction and removal of greenhouse gases, as well as supporting research into greenhouse gas abatement and renewable energy options.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that in recent years the sector has achieved significant production efficiencies which have kept emissions per unit of food as low as possible.  I am confident that farmers will continue to pursue such efficiencies, and my Department and Teagasc will assist them as <Col N="375"/>much as possible in this regard.   In this context, the continued implementation of the Nitrates Regulations is having and will continue to have an impact, as it results in better use of nutrients with consequently less nitrogen applications and therefore less nitrous oxide emissions.</P>
        <P>Recently introduced measures under the new Rural Environmental Protection Scheme are also expected to contribute to greenhouse gas abatement.  These include the encouragement of minimum tillage, the use of clover swards and the adoption of low emission trailing shoe technology for slurry spreading.  The scheme will also reward farmers for the planting and rejuvenation of hedgerows, which sequester carbon, and REPS farmers are being encouraged to establish high nature value woodland too, under the Forest Environment Protection Scheme, which will be fully rolled out in 2008.  In terms of reduced fertiliser use and consequent emissions, organic farming too has a role to play, and is supported by my Department&rsquo;s Organic Farming Scheme.</P>
        <P>The forestry sector is very important in addressing climate change, as it removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and is a valuable source of renewable energy, thereby displacing emissions from fossil fuels.  Forests planted from 1990 onwards are currently taking in an average of 2.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum.  The majority of new planting is being carried out by farmers and my Department will continue to actively promote such planting under the Afforestation Grant Scheme in 2008.</P>
        <P>Energy crops also have a role to play in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The extent of mitigation depends on total acreage of energy crops grown, so, to encourage farmers to grow more energy crops, I introduced a new National Energy Crop Premium worth &euro;80 per hectare in 2007, to supplement the EU Premium of up to &euro;45 per hectare available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme.  As a further support measure, land planted with energy crops can also benefit from the Single Farm Payment. I also launched a new Bioenergy Scheme offering establishment grants of up to &euro;1,450 per hectare to aid establishment of willow and miscanthus. I am glad to report that the Scheme is attracting keen interest from farmers. Since we launched the second phase of the Scheme last December, we have received over 150 applications for aid in respect of some 1,400 hectares.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I realise that further initiatives may be needed to address the challenge of climate change, which is why my Department has committed substantial funding, under the Research Stimulus Fund, to various research projects devoted to identifying sustainable greenhouse gas reduction measures and projects relating to energy crop production.  A comprehensive research needs analysis was recently carried out by my Department and will be used to inform future calls for research in the area of climate change.</P>
        <P>There are therefore a number of ways in which the farming sector can assist in the national effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, whether through efficiencies of production, the adoption of specific farming practices or the planting of forestry and energy crops.  However it is important that we should not overstate what can be achieved in terms of reduced emissions.  The imposition of unrealistically high targets for agriculture would create significant downward pressure on animal numbers, because there is no other way of achieving them.  At a time when the prospects for the dairying sector are bright, and demand for beef is also set to rise, it would make neither economic not environmental sense to pursue such a course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 103 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>The negotiations on the next WTO Round have entered another intensive phase as efforts continue to reach a full and final agreement by the end of 2008.   There is no doubt that the outcome of these negotiations will represent a significant challenge for EU and Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>The 2003 Reform of the CAP was undertaken with this Round of WTO negotiations clearly in mind.  The move to non-trade distorting decoupled payments has allowed the EU make significant commitments in these negotiations in relation to reductions in the trade distorting supports such as market and price supports.  The 2003 CAP Reforms also represent the limit of the EU Commission&rsquo;s negotiating position in these negotiations. This negotiating position has been approved by the EU Council of Ministers and has been reiterated on several occasions by the Council.  Any WTO agreement which would result in a further reform of the CAP would exceed this negotiating position and would be unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I will continue to insist that the Commission respects this negotiating position in these discussions.  The Common Agricultural Policy remains a cornerstone of the EU and the principles on which this policy is based are even more valid given the dynamics of the current global economy.  My priorities in these negotiations are to ensure that Irish agricultural products remain competitive on EU and world markets.  This can be achieved by securing appropriate levels of import protection for the EU market and ensuring that there is full parallel elimination <Col N="378"/>of all forms of export subsidies used by other exporting countries such as state trading enterprises, food aid and export credits.</P>
        <P>These negotiations are ongoing and there are a number of significant issues which remain unresolved. It would therefore be difficult at this point to analyse the overall impact on the Irish economy.  The Commission have however recently provided some details of their assessment of the impact of the proposals made last February by the Chairman of the WTO Agriculture Committee.  This analysis is currently the subject of discussion between Member States and the Commission.  In addition some independent assessments are likely to emerge in the near future.  In these circumstances I think it better, from both a technical and negotiating standpoint, to await further clarification from the Commission and input from other sources before drawing detailed conclusions on the likely impact of a possible trade deal, the details of which are not yet known.</P>

        <P>I am acutely conscious of the threats of various animal disease outbreaks and my Department continually reassesses such threats.  On the basis of such risk assessments, I and my officials review the adequacy of our control measures aimed at mitigating the risk of the introduction of such diseases to this country.</P>
        <P>In this regard, my Department has at its disposal, a wide range of veterinary, scientific, epidemiological, administrative and legal expertise, all of which contribute, as appropriate, to the process.  In addition, my Department is able to avail of extensive external expertise, some of which comes from other State agencies, including the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Met &Eacute;ireann, as well as organisations such as BirdWatch Ireland and academic expertise, including that provided by the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis in UCD and the Department of Zoology at NUI, Galway.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an increasing awareness developing that food security cannot be taken for granted in a world where demand is rising rapidly and is expected to double by 2050.  There is also a greater recognition of the key role that agriculture plays in managing scarce water and soil resources, and of the contribution it can make to renewable energy.  All these trends in societal expectations underpin the importance of the CAP and of the European model of agriculture.  </P>
        <P>In that connection, the 2003 reforms of the CAP with the introduction of the full decoupling of direct payments under the Single Payment Scheme ensures that farmers now have the &lsquo;freedom to farm&rsquo; and that the CAP is geared towards the demands of the market and consumers. The Single Payment Scheme is linked to food safety, animal welfare and environmental standards, and consumers are guaranteed a supply of safe food, produced to high animal welfare and environmental standards, at reasonable cost.</P>
        <P>In this context, it is worth noting that the EU is by far the largest player on the world market.  While imports of certain commodities into the Community may have increased, I believe that Ireland will remain a significant food producer and net exporter and will therefore not be affected to the same extent as food deficit countries by global food shortages.  However we will need to continuously monitor international food markets and be alive to both the threats and opportunities that may arise.</P>

	<P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, as amended, governs the granting, renewal, amendment or revocation of aquaculture licences. For the purposes of the Act &ldquo;aquaculture&rdquo; means &ldquo;the culture or farming of any species of fish, aquatic invertebrate animal of whatever habitat or aquatic plant, or any aquatic form of food suitable for the nutrition of fish&rdquo;. It is open to any individual or legal entity to apply for an aquaculture licence within the meaning and in accordance with the terms of the Act and any Regulations made thereunder.</P>
        <P>In relation to sea fishing-boat licences, the Licensing Authority for Sea Fishing Boats has advised me that a Sea-Fishing Boat Licence is required under EU and National law in respect of boats engaged in commercial fishing activities where such activities include, at any time; (1) Dredging for wild mussel seed/spat, or (2) Having on board fishing gear as specified in Table 3 of Annex 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 26/2004 of 30 December 2003 as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1799/2006 of 6 December 2006 on the Community fishing fleet register (dredges are included in this table).</P>
        <P>The entitlement to engage in any of the activities outlined depends on the segment of the fleet in which the boat is licensed and registered. Where a boat is licensed and registered within the Aquaculture Segment of the Irish fishing fleet, it is a condition of the licence that the boat shall be used solely for the management, development and servicing of aquaculture areas.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.  Breaches of food labelling legislation should be reported to the FSAI.</P>
        <P>EU beef labelling legislation requiring country of origin labelling of beef has been in place since September 2000.  As this legislation did not cover beef sold by the catering trade I collaborated with the Minister for Health &amp; Children to have national legislation enacted to require that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is enforced by the FSAI.</P>
        <P>Regarding the labelling of poultrymeat, there are EU Regulations which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultrymeat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultrymeat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  However, it indicated that it will reconsider the draft measures once we have submitted additional explanatory information.  This information is currently being prepared for transmission to the Commission.  I will continue to press for progress, as I believe consumers are entitled to full information on the labelling of food products.</P>

	<P>There were no prosecutions taken under the Noxious Weeds Act 1936 by my Department in 2007.  However, over the past two years my Department has conducted public awareness campaigns for the control of noxious weeds.  The campaigns were directed at landowners and users of land &mdash; mainly farmers, Local Authorities and developers.  Campaigns consisted of the circulation of posters for display in all DAFF, Teagasc and local Authority offices countrywide, as well as in agricultural centres such as Co-ops, livestock marts, merchants&rsquo; premises etc.  I issued press releases on the subject of noxious weeds control and placed notices in the national newspapers.</P>
        <P>These campaigns were in response to the increasing prevalence over recent years of noxious weeds, especially ragwort, on road margins, development sites and on farmed lands.</P>
        <P>In addition to the public awareness campaigns, my Department issued notices to offenders to have weeds dealt with.  These notices were issued whenever complaints were made by members of the public or as a result of inspections carried out by my Department&rsquo;s Field Officers.</P>
        <P>The control of noxious weeds has been made a cross-compliance requirement for Single Farm Payment under Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions, which means that failure to comply with this condition may result in a reduction in the Single Farm Payment.</P>
        <P>While the Act makes provision for taking prosecutions against offenders, this measure has not been resorted to in recent years.  The preference has been to appeal to the better nature of persons responsible for such weed infested areas to face up to their responsibility under the Act and have them controlled.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department have met with the National Roads Authority and I am pleased to note that the Authority has embarked on a package of initiatives for the control of noxious weeds.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 109 together.</P>
        <P>The situation in Northern Ireland and the information available to me and my Department is essentially as I outlined to the House on 21st February.</P>
        <P>I would point out, however, that the events in Northern Ireland did not constitute an outbreak of bluetongue, as defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 &ndash; the bluetongue regulation.  The virus had been detected in a single animal in Co Antrim on 15th February and that cow and her calf were slaughtered as were a further 23 cows and their calves, following further tests results, which indicated the presence of antibodies or virus in four further calves born from cows in the same consignment.  However, at no point was there any evidence that the bluetongue virus was circulating in Northern Ireland and, therefore, this event did not constitute an outbreak and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s disease free status was not affected.</P>
        <P>In response to those events, I took unilateral action and introduced a safeguard measure to place a temporary ban on the import of female cattle over 12 months and female sheep over 6 months from premises and holdings in bluetongue restricted zones. This applies only to cattle or sheep for breeding / fattening but not for slaughter.  This ban remains in place and will do so until I am satisfied that the EU control measures are adequately revised.  Changes to the existing arrangements have been tabled by the EU Commission and are being considered at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Animal Health and Food Chain this week.  I will review the temporary ban in the light of any decision taken to amend the Commission Regulation at this meeting.</P>
        <P>Following confirmation of the detection of the virus in Northern Ireland, I have asked my officials to further assess the risk and, based on that assessment, which I expect to be concluded very shortly, I will introduce any such additional control measures as are considered appropriate.  My Department&rsquo;s contingency arrangements to mitigate the risk of the introduction of the bluetongue virus into the country are based on the existing EU legislation and an ongoing assessment of the risk to Ireland.</P>
        <P>In terms of my Department&rsquo;s overall contingency arrangements, we have produced a comprehensive Bluetongue Contingency Plan for Ireland.  Information and advice leaflets on Bluetongue were sent to every farmer in the country as well as specifically tailored advisory material as to all members of the Veterinary Profession. My Department&rsquo;s contingency arrangements are kept under constant review and revised as appropriate by reference to the developing disease situation or in the light of legal or other developments, particularly at EU level. In <Col N="384"/>addition, we are also refining arrangements for delivery of a vaccination programme in the event that it becomes necessary to vaccinate here.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, I strongly urge Irish farmers not to import livestock under any circumstances, as this represents the biggest risk of the introduction of this disease.  I have made this clear to the Farming Organisations during the many briefings on bluetongue and have asked that they too use their influence accordingly.</P>

        <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The allocation of milk quota to new entrants and small producers has been a feature of the milk quota system for a number of years. Preferential access to milk quota from a specially created priority pool was available under the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme until 2006, and the same priority pool arrangement is a feature of the new Milk Quota Trading Scheme. Indeed, the quantities of quota available to new entrants &mdash; whether farming on their own or in partnership with parents &mdash; and small producers have been considerably increased as a result of my introduction of the latter scheme in 2007.</P>
        <P>In addition, the changes I announced recently to the milk quota regulations will facilitate greater participation in Milk Production Partnerships, which will benefit new entrants and small producers. Farmers previously involved in beef or cereals production, for example, will be able to join forces with milk producers in developing their enterprises and bringing greater efficiencies and lifestyle improvements to their operations. There will also be no limit on the numbers that can participate in an individual Milk Production Partnership, which will in turn facilitate the participation of more than one son or daughter in New Entrant/Parent partnerships.</P>
        <P>The recently-completed Milk Quota Trading Scheme in respect of the 2008/2009 milk quota year will be reviewed with the farming organisations and ICOS in the coming weeks, and any suggestions relating to new entrants and small producers will be considered by my Department.</P>

	<P>To promote the increased production and use of biofuels, the Commission is proposing that biofuels make up 10% of EU transport fuel by 2020. This has led to concerns that the demand for biofuels is compromising food production and driving up the price of food. While it its true that cereal and rapeseed prices reached record levels in 2007, this was due only in part to the increased interest in biofuels, other factors include the tight global wheat supply situation due to declining stocks and poor harvests resulting from adverse weather conditions as well as increasing demand for grain from developing economies such as China and India.</P>
        <P>In response to the current high prices for cereals and the abolition by the EU of compulsory set aside, extra land is being devoted to cereal production in Ireland and across the Community in 2008. It is forecast that the 2008 wheat crop could increase across the EU by 17m tonnes compared to 2007. As crops for biofuels are estimated to account for about 3m &mdash; 4m tonnes of production, the additional 13m tonnes of cereals at EU level should help increase the availability of stocks for food and animal feed. Teagasc estimate that potentially some 75,000 &ndash; 100,000 hectares of land could be devoted to energy crops in Ireland without impacting negatively on animal feed and food production. In the near future, the feedstock base could be expanded further in Ireland with the development of new second-generation technologies to convert biomass crops (miscanthus and willow) into liquid biofuels. The Irish climate is generally well suited to the production of biomass crops.</P>
        <P>In 2007, the EU Commission carried out an &lsquo;Impact Assessment&rsquo; to assess the effect of the 10% biofuel target on EU- 27 agricultural markets in 2020. Taking into account such issues as the likely level of imports, the increased availability of second-generation biofuels from 2014 onwards and the fact that biomass yields (miscanthus, straw etc.) could be significantly higher than for cereals, the Commission conclude that the 10% biofuel scenario would not overly stretch land availability, and as a consequence food production.</P>
        <P>In January&rsquo; 08, the EU Commission published a new Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of the use of renewable energy sources. The Directive lays down detailed rules relating to environmental sustainability criteria for biofuels that are counted towards the 10% target and proposes a detailed monitoring and reporting system for biofuel production. As part of the monitoring process, Member States are required to submit <Col N="386"/>a report to Commission in 2011 and every 2 years thereafter detailing, among other things, the impact on commodity prices and land use changes within the Member State associated with the increased use of biomass and other forms of renewable energy.  The Commission will be required to analyse, among other items, the impact of EU biofuel policy on the availability of foodstuffs in exporting countries, the ability of people in developing countries to afford these foodstuffs and wider development issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reality is that biofuel production is currently one of the few practical ways of making a real impact on oil dependence and greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. Nonetheless the objective should be to ensure that biofuels are produced in a sustainable fashion and do not have undesirable consequences for food production, the environment and biodiversity.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.  Breaches of food labelling legislation should be reported to the FSAI.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat.  This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation. The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  However, it indicated that it will reconsider the draft measures once we have submitted additional explanatory information. This information is currently being prepared for transmission to the Commission.  I will continue to press for progress, as I believe consumers are entitled to full information on the labelling of food products.</P>

      </Qst>
        <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Bord Bia conducted consumer research recently on potato consumption trends and highlights the carbohydrate competition that exists in the market. Increasingly, consumers are looking for convenience, consistent eating quality, ease of preparation and quality assurance in terms of their purchasing choices. The potato industry has to consider these issues and must aim to provide what the consumer requires. With this demand for increased convenience and ease of preparation in mind there does appear to be a move to value added products such as semi prepared and par cooked products.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia also has seasonal promotions of potatoes throughout the year, highlighting the availability of locally produced Irish potatoes along with recipes and, of course, the nutritional benefits of potatoes such as the fact that they are a good source of potassium, important for a healthy blood pressure and contribute a significant amount of vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant and important for immune health.</P>
        <P>The United Nations has declared 2008 as the International Year of the Potato. The Year aims at raising the profile of this globally important food crop, giving emphasis to its nutritional attributes, and thus promoting its production, consumption, marketing and trade. My Department has been actively involved in  setting up a committee comprising representatives of the Industry and State Agencies who have been busy putting in place an interesting programme of activities to mark the year.</P>
        <P>One of the major events being organised is a national competition aimed at all primary schools called Meet the spuds (more info at www.internationalyearofthepotato.ie).  Through the active support of many organisations and the organisational skills of Agri-aware, potato growing packs were made available to the 3,500 primary schools in the country. I am very pleased to note that over 50% of schools have registered for the competition.  Whilst the competition is presented in a fun and pupil friendly manner it has a very serious and important message, which is to encourage the production and consumption of locally produced potatoes and to promote the potato as a valuable food source. It can be seen as part of the ongoing revival of local agriculture and farmers&rsquo; markets, a renaissance in regional cooking and food traditions and as part of a grassroots campaign to get junk food out of our kitchens, and to revert to good wholesome Irish food.</P>

	<P>The sheep sector is an important part of the overall agri-food sector and its future depends on its ability to meet the needs of the market. The Malone Report set the blueprint for the sector&rsquo;s future development and an implementation group was established to oversee the implementation of the <Col N="388"/>recommendations contained in the report. Most of the recommendations contained in the report fall to be implemented by the industry itself but my Department and the state agencies under my aegis are also playing an active role.</P>
        <P>The timetable for the implementation of the report varies according to the recommendation under consideration. Some recommendations have already been implemented whereas others are works in progress and consultations are ongoing in regard to their implementation.</P>
        <P>Under REPS 4, a new mixed grazing measure specially targeted at sheep farmers has been introduced and development of this measure will be kept under review.</P>
        <P>Plans for the upgrading of a Sheep Genetic Improvement Programme are well advanced and I hope that agreement can be reached and a new programme put in place for the 2008/2009 sheep breeding year.</P>
        <P>Transparency on pricing is a pre-requisite for efforts to improve quality and respond to the needs of the market. Farmer confidence in the pricing system operated by plants will be improved if mechanical grading can be introduced. My Department is currently facilitating trials on this that commenced in March 2008.</P>
        <P>Teagasc are making a very positive contribution as well and have developed a comprehensive plan to restructure their sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which includes hill and lowland areas.  This approach will provide an opportunity for developing a dialogue with sheep farmers about the application of the latest management practices to their enterprises and identify research and development needs.</P>
        <P>The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme was established in 2007. Bord Bia is also playing a prominent part. Almost 6,000 farms have been registered to date and over 4,200 farm audits have been carried out. In 2007 the Department made available &euro;0.4m to support inspections under the scheme and this funding will be repeated again in 2008 and 2009.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures being taken at producer and processor level, promotional efforts are very necessary. Bord Bia will continue to organize strategic marketing campaigns marketing in selected European markets. The downward trend in lamb consumption in certain markets presents a real challenge. To address this, Bord Bia is collaborating with its French and British counterparts on a 3 year generic lamb promotion on the very important French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.</P>

	<P>Irish Life Tables are calculated and published at least 2 years after each census year. For example, Irish Life Tables 14 were published in 2004, 2 years after the 2002 census. The Central Statistics Office intends to publish Irish Life Tables 15 in 2008, 2 years after the 2006 census.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Irish Life Tables are calculated based on population data from the census, and 3 years mortality data centred on the census year. Thus, Irish Life Tables 15 will be based on population data from the 2006 census, and mortality data from the years 2005, 2006, and 2007. This is why the Irish Life Tables 15 could not have been published before 2008.</P>

	<P>My Department relies on the Office of Public Works (OPW) for the provision of accommodation including maintenance and refurbishment which includes the provision of efficient heating and lighting in offices. This Department endeavours to operate heating and lighting systems in the most efficient manner.</P>
        <P>The OPW has an energy awareness programme underway in all large buildings, State Buildings, including those occupied by this Department.  Based on an advanced pilot programme completed last year, this is expected to achieve 15% savings on an annual basis.  This energy reduction programme is the first step in achieving the 2020 target of 33%.</P>
        <P>At present, the OPW is, in conjunction with my Department, devising an energy awareness programme appropriate to the Department&rsquo;s needs.  It will be several months before any quantifiable progress will be evident.  It is expected that considerable progress will be made in the next heating season beginning next September 2008.</P>
        <P>An essential part of the energy reduction plan is to monitor energy usage.  The OPW provides a monitoring service to my Department using a web based logging system which has been installed in advance of the energy awareness programme in the targeted State buildings.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not able to give precise figures for &ldquo;the number of people registered as employers with the Revenue Commissioners in the construction industry as defined under the Registered Employment Agreement&rdquo;. </P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners use NACE (European Economic Activity) codes to classify taxpayers. This is the same system as used by the Central Statistics Office.  These NACE codes do not correspond with the definition of building firms or civil engineering firms contained in Schedule 2 of the Registered Employment Agreement (REA)  for the Construction Industry. <Col N="393"/> Furthermore, some employers may be registered with Revenue as an employer in respect of more than one business.</P>
        <P>In addition, the REA applies to a &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in the construction industry, a term which has a broader definition than &ldquo;employee&rdquo; has for the purposes of the Income Tax (Employments)(Consolidated) Regulations 2001.  Case law on the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (which gives legal basis to the REA) suggests that the definition is wide enough to include individual subcontractors as a &ldquo;worker&rdquo;.  These subcontractors are &lsquo;self employed&rsquo; for the purposes of the Taxes Consolidation Act and persons solely engaging these individuals would not have to register with Revenue as employers.</P>
        <P>The number of employers on the Revenue Commissioners records with NACE codes that roughly correspond to the definition of building firms or civil engineering firms in the REA is 38,665.</P>

	<P>Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 exempts from income tax certain earnings of writers, composers and artists. Specifically, the exemption applies to earnings from writing, composing or executing a certain work, which has been determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be an original and creative work, having or generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit. The exemption is only available to individuals who are resident in the State and not resident elsewhere for tax purposes. Where these conditions are satisfied there is no provision for the withdrawal of the relief.</P>
        <P>The cost to the Exchequer of the artists&rsquo; exemption scheme in 2004, the most recent year for which statistics are available, is estimated at &euro;28 million.</P>

Almost all suppliers to my Department and programme beneficiaries from my Department&rsquo;s Vote as well as staff expenses are paid by electronic funds transfer, rather than by paper payable orders as would have been the case in the past.</P>
        <P>The Paymaster General&rsquo;s Office has recently replaced paper based methods for the transfer of funds in support of Departmental payments systems with an electronic system. It is also in the process of providing Departments and Offices with an online reporting facility to replace the paper monthly reports which are issued.</P><Col N="394"/>
        <P>In the case of staff remuneration, almost all of my Department&rsquo;s staff are paid electronically and the greater number of them have also opted for electronic payslips instead of a paper version. Arrangements are in hand to have all wage and salary recipients use electronic payslips where this is feasible.</P>
        <P>Other initiatives being undertaken to reduce the volume of printed documentation are the publishing of reports on the Department&rsquo;s website and the publishing of office notices and circulars on an electronic bulletin board. An electronic version of the Public Service Management System is due to be introduced.  There are also plans to enhance the Departmental intranet to include additional information relevant to staff. In addition all printers procured must have automatic duplex functionality which allows for printing on both sides of the page.</P>

        <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established on 2 April 2001 with the objective of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until at least 2055.</P>
        <P>For this purpose, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 provides that 1% of GNP is to be paid from the Exchequer into the Fund each year. I do not propose to increase the Exchequer contribution to the Fund at this time.</P>
        <P>The estimated market value of the fund on 26 December 2007 was &euro;21.3 billion. The Commission publishes fund value and performance figures on a quarterly basis.

        <P>Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission controls and manages the National Pensions Reserve Fund. The Commission has discretionary authority to determine the Fund&rsquo;s investment strategy in accordance with the Fund&rsquo;s statutory investment policy of securing the optimal total financial return provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission. This framework has given the Commission the freedom to develop, outside of the political process, a long-term investment strategy primarily based on a diversified portfolio of real assets. Indeed, a long-term State fund with no need for liquidity and no requirement to match liabilities on a yearly basis has some clear advantages in seeking to maximise long-term investment returns.</P>
        <P>I am aware and I accept that the appropriate investment strategy for a long-term investment fund can involve occasional short-term volatility. In its 2006 Annual Report, the Commission states that its asset allocation strategy is founded on the premise that real assets, such as equities and property, whose performance is linked to the rate of economic growth, will continue, over the long term, to outperform financial assets such as bonds. It goes on to say that, while equities are inherently more volatile than bonds, with sharp performance swings over short time periods, the Fund&rsquo;s long-term investment horizon enables it to accept this volatility in a trade-off for the higher expected return.</P>

While this may have some socially progressive features, I am not convinced that it is the best way forward to address issues relating to welfare dependency and low income families.  It is more effective to provide more jobs, combined with security, good wages, and developing better social welfare support.  That is, and continues to be, the Government&rsquo;s policy focus.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, under the provisions of Section 879 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, an individual must submit a return of his or her income, on a form prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners when required to do so by notice given by an inspector.  Such return must be submitted within the time limit specified in the notice.</P>
        <P>The forms prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners for the making of a tax return include a Form 11 and a Form 12.  In general, a tax return made by a PAYE taxpayer is made on a Form 12. The notice requiring such an individual to submit a tax return is contained on the Form. In addition, such an individual must submit his or her tax return by 31 October in the tax year following the tax year in respect of which the return is due.</P>
        <P>Forms 12 are issued to PAYE taxpayers on a restricted basis, based on criteria selected by the Revenue Commissioners each year and reviewed each year. The criteria include high income cases, customers with non- PAYE or trading income or who claim the higher value and more complex tax reliefs.  For example, in 2007 Revenue issued Forms 12 to single people with an income exceeding &euro;100,000 and to married couples where the combined incomes exceeded &euro;180,000 for the previous year. In addition forms were sent to people who declared untaxed income in 2006 from a variety of sources in excess of &euro;3,174 net. over and above their PAYE income. That included people with foreign salaries, pensions, fees and commission. PAYE taxpayers with specific levels of trading and rental/investment income also were asked to complete a Form 12. Typically in recent years, Revenue issue 40,000 &ndash; 50,000 Forms 12 and PAYE taxpayers request and complete a further 40,000 or so Form 12 returns. To put this in context, Revenue has approximately 2.5 million PAYE employments on record.  The vast majority of workers never complete a Form 12 as the normal operation of PAYE accounts for their tax liability in full.</P>

	<P>The accounting standard IAS 19 is not used in the public service. However an exercise has been carried out to estimate the accrued liability for public service occupational pensions. As of 2007 the accrued pensions liability in respect of all serving and retired public servants was estimated at &euro;75bn. The mor<Col N="398"/>tality assumption underlying this estimate is based on a special mortality table which was considered appropriate for use in forecasting pension costs for public servants. Under this mortality table the life expectancy for a male aged 65 is 22 years. There is no breakdown available of the above liability figure in respect of different areas of the public service. </P>

	<P>There are a number of developments underway relating to energy efficiency in the public sector. In this context, I have been advised by the Office of Public works that energy efficient lighting is used  for all new buildings  and refurbishment work except in exceptional circumstances. Even in the latter, new developments in lighting will mean that even in these unusual circumstances it will be possible to use energy efficient and economic solutions in the foreseeable future. Energy efficient lighting is the norm in schools, hospitals and other public service buildings.  Here again it is only in exceptional circumstances that incandescent lighting is used in any new or newly refurbished buildings.</P>
<P>The OPW has an energy awareness programme underway in all large State buildings. Based on an advance pilot programme completed last year this is expected to achieve 15% savings on an annual basis. This energy reduction programme is the first step in achieving the 2020 target of 33%. The progress to date has focused on putting the energy awareness programme <Col N="399"/>in place and it is expected that it will several months before any quantifiable progress will be evident.  An essential part of the energy reduction plan is to monitor the energy usage.  In respect of my own Department and those operating in the Government Buildings complex, the Office of Public Works provide a monitoring service using a web based logging system which has been installed in advance of the energy awareness programme in the targeted State buildings.</P>
<P>For the present there is no Office of Public Works programme to undertake refurbishment work solely on the basis of energy conservation.  Such a programme may be necessary in the future.  However, where refurbishment is necessary or planned at present, energy saving will be considered in the designs and any reasonable or economic improvements will be incorporated. My Department does not have a capital budget  allocated to energy efficient measures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The current policy of the OPW with regards to energy criteria for new buildings is to specify a maximum energy performance target of 120kWh/m2 year for standard office accommodation. This target would be considered best practice for this type of building. Other types of building would require individual targets dependant on function and purpose. In the present leased market it is not practical to set a similar type of target and so buildings acquired by lease or existing buildings that are being purchased are not set such an energy target.</P>
<P>As part of the National Climate Change Strategy, the OPW is committed to converting a number of the heating systems in existing buildings to Biomass. This programme of work is underway and is due for completion before the next heating season. Although this is not specifically an energy efficiency measure it will reduce the carbon footprint.  </P>
        <P>Energy efficiency is considered in the refurbishment of existing accommodation and where economically practical improvements are incorporated into the works to maximise energy performance.</P>
        <P>An essential part of the OPW&rsquo;s Staff Energy Awareness Campaign, which is currently underway, is a preliminary energy audit in each of the targeted buildings. It is anticipated that these  energy audits will identify areas for improvement in the energy performance in certain buildings and improvement works will be considered when these audits have been completed.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 139 together.</P>
        <P>The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States. In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services. While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date. However the European Commission, who is the deciding authority, refused such requests.</P>
<P>Consequently, as the Deputy may be aware, the Finance Act 2008 provides the legislative changes to withdraw the relief in respect of fuel used for public passenger transport vehicles. The relief will be withdrawn with effect from 1 November 2008 and the appropriate full excise rates will apply from that date. In the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.</P>
        <P>However, the Department of Transport and other relevant line Departments, who have primary responsibility in this regard, are, in conjunction with my Department, continuing to explore alternative mechanisms that may be used to direct Exchequer resources toward such services from that date, subject of course to compatibility with competition and EU State Aid requirements. I understand that the Department of Transport is taking legal advice as regards the appropriateness of alternative forms of relief.</P>

        <P>The Valuation Act, 2001 provides that &ldquo;community halls&rdquo; including clubhouses which are not licensed to sell alcohol and whose facilities are not used primarily for profit or gain, are not rateable.</P>

        <P>The sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and these premises are competing with other commercial premises.  The effect of removing any category of rateable property from the valuation base would be to increase the rates burden on other ratepayers.</P>

        <Quest> the status of the proposed fair deal nursing home legislation; if the legal drafting difficulties have been successfully addressed; when the legislation will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas; her views on interim arrangements for families who are being forced to sell homes while this legislation is delayed; if her Department has consulted with the stakeholders, in particular Age Action Ireland, who are looking for consultation on the proposed legislation; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill providing for the Fair Deal scheme is being finalised by the Office of the Attorney General at present. The legislation is complex, demanding careful consideration in the course of drafting.  It would not be appropriate to comment further until the Bill has been brought before the Government for approval.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, intends to publish the Bill as soon as possible following finalisation by the Attorney General and Government approval, and to bring the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas thereafter.  Interim arrangements, such as the one referred to by the Deputy, will be a matter for the Government approval. In the meantime, an additional 300 long-stay residential care beds are being made available in early 2008. 200 of these beds have been contracted in private nursing homes with the remainder being provided by a new Community Nursing Unit due to open in St. Mary&rsquo;s in the Phoenix Park, Dublin.</P>
        <P>Since the announcement of the new scheme, my Department has met with the National Federation of Pensioners&rsquo; Associations, the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and the Social Partners (which includes Age Action Ireland). The Department also attended the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament AGM at its request and participated in a workshop on the new scheme. On publication of the Bill, further engagement will take place with stakeholders on the details of the new scheme. This will take place under the auspices of Towards 2016.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.</P>
        <P>The recruitment pause put in place in September 2007 was initiated as part of the HSE financial break-even plan to facilitate the delivery of services on budget in accordance with the provisions of the 2007 National Service Plan.  This pause did not involve random job cuts but did mean that the recruitment of staff to approved positions was delayed.  The HSE put in place a derogation process to deal with the filling of essential posts to protect front-line services and close to 900 posts were approved under this process.</P>
        <P>This temporary pause in recruitment ended on 31st December 2007 and any posts falling vacant from 1st January 2008 can be filled subject to the provisions Circular 01/2008. This circular sets out the HSE Employment Control Framework for 2008 and is aimed at ensuring that health services are delivered in accordance with the provisions of the 2008 National Service Plan and within the funding provided by Government.</P>
        <P>The Employment Control Framework provides for the filling of vacancies arising in 2008, the filling of approved and funded service development posts not filled at the end of 2007 and new service developments in 2008.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider <Col N="405"/>the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 157 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, from manufacturers and wholesalers through to community pharmacists, with a view to seeking value for money in the State&rsquo;s drugs bill, consistent with patient safety and continuity of supply. After extensive consultation and independent analysis, the HSE announced revised pricing arrangements for wholesale delivery on 17th September 2007.</P>
        <P>A process of dialogue was established under Mr. Bill Shipsey SC to address concerns expressed by the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU), on behalf of community pharmacists. At a meeting between the HSE and the IPU under Mr Shipsey SC on 5 December 2007, a proposal was outlined to the IPU to (i) address their immediate concerns regarding the alleged impact of the proposed revised wholesaler arrangements on GMS-dependent pharmacies and (ii) to provide a basis upon which discussions on a new substantive contract could commence. The <Col N="406"/>IPU was not prepared to accept this proposal from the HSE and, accordingly, no further discussions have taken place under Mr Shipsey&rsquo;s aegis since then.</P>
        <P>On 18 February 2008 I established an Independent Body to begin work immediately to assess an interim, fair community pharmacy dispensing fee for the existing level of service being provided by pharmacists. This Body is being chaired by Se&aacute;n Dorgan, former Head of IDA Ireland. It has been asked to make its recommendations by the end of May 2008.</P>
        <P>Both the HSE as the contracting body and the IPU as the representative organisation for community pharmacists, along with other stakeholders, are entitled to make submissions to the Independent Body. Its recommended fee level, subject to Government approval, will be backdated to the date from which any pharmacist may choose to avail of the HSE&rsquo;s interim contract offer. The development of a substantive new contract will also get underway as soon as possible. This will be done under the auspices of an agreed facilitator and it too will be priced by the Independent Body.</P>

        <P>Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that, according to the Health Service Personnel Census, the number (expressed in wholetime equivalents) of occupational therapists and speech and language therapists employed in the public health service for each of the years 2000 to 2007 is as follows:</P>

	<P>Persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services qualify for a medical card, which entitles them to a range of health services free of charge.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>The assessment of eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged 70 and over, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examin<Col N="411"/>ation of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).  The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.</P>
        <P>Since 2006, additional funding has been allocated to the HSE for the implementation of the Primary Care Strategy, which aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of occupational therapists, general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, and others.  Under the Towards 2016 agreement, the Government is committed to further increasing the number of Primary Care Teams on a phased basis between 2008 and 2011.  Furthermore, as part of the Multi-Annual Investment Programme 2006-2009 under the Disability Strategy, the Government provided the Health Service Executive with an additional &euro;75 million in both 2006 and 2007, with a further &euro;50 million provided in 2008.  This funding includes moneys to provide new and enhanced services for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits and services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177, 181 and 221 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has designated University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE Western Region, which includes Sligo.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo General Hospital.  In this context, chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.  Cancer day care units, including at Sligo General Hospital, will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients as close to home as possible.</P>
        <P>The decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  Professor Tom Keane, Director of the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Control Programme, is currently engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the orderly phased transfer of services between locations. The key objective of the National Cancer Control Programme is to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient mortality and survival irrespective of geography.  This will involve significant re-alignment of cancer services to move from the present fragmented system of care to one which is consistent with international best practice in cancer control.</P><Col N="413"/>
        <P>Following the publication of the National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) advised that it would be conducting a quality review of the implementation of these standards.  HIQA will work closely with Professor Keane to ensure that this review supports the move toward the eight cancer centres and assures the safe transition of services in the remaining centres.  My Department has requested HIQA to respond directly to the Deputies in relation to the specific queries raised by them about the audit.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 213 together.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Health Service Executive (HSE) that, owing to regulatory difficulties experienced by the manufacturer of the BCG vaccine, there was a shortage of the vaccine from late 2007.  This was a Europe-wide problem as the manufacturer in question is the only company which supplies the vaccine to the European Market.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to stockpile the vaccine as it has a very short shelf life.  These difficulties have now been resolved and new stocks of licensed vaccine are now available.</P>
        <P>I understand from the HSE that clinics have now resumed and that parents of any baby who has not received BCG vaccine will be contacted by their Local Health Office with an appointment to receive the vaccine.</P>

	<P>The Competition Authority submitted its report on the health insurance market in January last year.  The Authority made 16 recommendations to improve competition in the health insurance market.  This report was one of three reports received in early 2007.  Others were submitted by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and the Barrington Group.  The recommendations contained in all three reports were considered by the Government on 24 April 2007 and the Government made a number of decisions concerning the health insurance market based on recommendations in all three reports.</P>

Seven recommendations related to the HIA&rsquo;s oversight of the market covering consumer information and awareness, switching, enhancing its powers, employer deduction arrangements, the use of the health status weight in the Risk Equalisation Scheme and moving to a prospective risk equalisation system.</P>
        <P>The HIA continues to run media campaigns covering consumer issues and to address this and other consumer matters on its website.  In addition it has recently reached agreement with the industry on providing more information in renewal notices.  The question of the use of the health status weight in the Risk Equalisation Scheme is a matter for the HIA.  The question of assigning additional legislative powers to the Authority is under consideration.  Recommendations were also made covering the minimum benefit package and the sale of limited cover plans.  On foot of the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the three Reports, the HIA is currently undertaking a detailed study on the extent to which community rating should apply and it is also considering the Competition Authority&rsquo;s recommendation on moving to a prospective risk equalisation system.</P>
        <P>I have written to the Chairman of the VHI concerning the Authority&rsquo;s recommendation relating to VHI&rsquo;s travel insurance.  VHI has had discussions with the Financial Regulator on this issue.  The Authority also recommended that entitlement to the three year exemption from risk equalisation payments be clarified.  Having regard to that recommendation and related recommendations made in the other reports considered by the Government, legislation removing the exemption was enacted last year.  The Department has also written to the employers representative body concerning the manner in which salary deduction mechanisms operate.</P>
        <P>The bulk of the recommendations made in the Reports from the Competition Authority, the Health Insurance Authority and the Barrington Report have already been implemented, or are in the process of being implemented or being given consideration.</P>

	<P>Under the Health Act, 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.  This includes responsibility for <Col N="415"/>arrangements to ensure appropriate service delivery for General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme (medical card and GP visit card) patients.</P>
        <P>Services under the GMS Scheme are provided by general practitioners (GPs) holding contracts with the HSE.  The terms of these contracts were agreed on foot of negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO).  Under the terms agreed, contracts are made available where the HSE decides, after consultation with the IMO, that there is a need for a service having regard to a range of factors, including whether the needs of the population in the area are met by the services already available.  The agreement also provides that the number of persons on a GP&rsquo;s patient panel may not exceed 2,000, save in exceptional circumstances.  Not all GPs hold GMS contracts, as they may not qualify or wish to provide services under the Scheme.</P>
        <P>When a person qualifies for a medical card or GP visit card, he/she accesses services by choosing a GP from a list of local GPs who have been contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme.  The person will be assigned to the GP he/she has chosen from the list subject to the GP&rsquo;s acceptance and his/her total patient list being within the agreed limit.  If a person is unsuccessful in locating a GP who is able to take on additional patients, the HSE may in certain circumstances assign an eligible patient to a medical practitioner&rsquo;s list.</P>
        <P>The arrangements for the provision of publicly funded GP services, including those provided under the GMS Scheme, are under review.  I regard the existing arrangements in relation to access by GPs to public contracts as unnecessarily restrictive and it is my wish that new contractual arrangements for the provision of publicly-funded GP services should ensure that HSE contracts are open to all suitably qualified and equipped doctors.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has designated University College Hospital Galway (UCHG) and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE Western Region, which includes Sligo.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.</P><Col N="416"/>
        <P>Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo General Hospital.  In this context, chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.  Cancer day care units, including at Sligo General Hospital, will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients as close to home as possible.</P>
        <P>The decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  Professor Tom Keane, Director of the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Control Programme, is currently engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the orderly phased transfer of services between locations.  The key objective of the National Cancer Control Programme is to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient mortality and survival irrespective of geography.  This will involve significant re-alignment of cancer services to move from the present fragmented system of care to one which is consistent with international best practice in cancer control.  Patients from Sligo needing radiotherapy continue to be referred to the Radiation Oncology Department at UCHG for treatment.</P>
        <P>I met with Minister Michael McGimpsey of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS), Northern Ireland on 28 November last.  The potential for further cross-Border co-operation and collaboration in relation to cancer care, and specifically, provision of a satellite centre for radiation oncology in the North West, linked to Belfast City Hospital was discussed.  Consideration of a satellite centre in the North West will have regard to populations in Border counties e.g. Donegal, Derry, and possibly parts of Fermanagh and Tyrone.  It was agreed that both Departments would progress this issue through the Joint North/South Feasibility Study on the potential for future co-operation.  In this context my Department has provided data on cancer incidence in border counties to the DHSSPS.  It is expected that the Study relating to radiation oncology services will conclude in a few months time.</P>

	<P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, and I are anxious for the new nursing home support scheme to come into operation as soon as possible.  In the interim, the existing subvention scheme continues to operate.  The aim of the subvention scheme is to provide financial assistance to older people towards the cost of maintenance in a private nursing home.</P>
        <P>In January 2007 the rate of basic subvention was increased substantially, to &euro;300 per week.  This means that many more people should be eligible for subvention than in the past.  Also, additional funding was made available for both subvention and enhanced subvention last year.  The amount of enhanced subvention paid is at the discretion of the HSE and varies according to the cost of care.  Individuals who are in receipt of a subvention may apply for a review if their nursing home increases its fees.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Health Contribution was introduced by virtue of the Health Contributions Act 1979 and came into effect on the 6th April of that year.  The contributions are levied on income at a percentage rate set in pursuance of the Health Contributions Act and are paid over to the Minister for Health and Children in respect of the Vote for the Health Service Executive.  The current rate of contribution is 2% of gross income up to &euro;1,925 per week or &euro;100,100 per annum and 2.5% on the balance of income in excess of those amounts in a contribution year.  Subject to exemptions, the rate of contribution is applicable to all persons over the age of sixteen with reckonable income, earnings or emoluments.</P>
        <P>The exemptions, as outlined in Section 11 of the Act, are those whose income does not exceed &euro;480 per week, those who are fully eligible for health services as set out in Section 45 of the Health Act 1970 (i.e. medical cardholders in this State, including those workers covered under EC Regulation 1408/71), recipients of a Social Welfare Widow&rsquo;s/Widower&rsquo;s Pension, One-parent Family Payment or Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit/Allowance, as well as those in receipt of a Widow&rsquo;/Widower&rsquo;s pension acquired under the social security legislation of an EU member State.</P>
        <P>When the primary legislation was enacted no upper age limit applied to the health contribution.  However, as the Deputy is aware, following the announcement in Budget 2001, full eligibility for health services under Section 45 of the Health Act was granted to those aged 70 and over, effectively placing an upper age limit of 69 years on liability to pay health contributions.</P>
        <P>As the Health Contribution is not in fact granted to an individual but is rather levied upon an individual&rsquo;s reckonable income, I have asked officials in my Department to investigate the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;, which was launched in January 2006, provides a framework for action to develop modern, high quality mental health services over a seven to ten year period.  The Government has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of our mental health services. Implementation of the Report is the responsibility of the HSE.</P>
        <P>An independent Monitoring Group was established in March 2006, to monitor and assess progress by the Health Service Executive, government departments and other agencies in implementing the recommendations set out in the Report.  The Monitoring Group&rsquo;s first annual report was published in May 2007.  The Monitoring Group indicated that despite some signifi<Col N="418"/>cant initiatives, there was little evidence of a systematic approach to implementation within the HSE.</P>
        <P>In January 2008, the Government announced the establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 197 together.</P>
        <P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to increase health service capacity through the development of services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.  It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.</P>
        <P>The provision of the appropriate infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of primary care services is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors.  These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.  I understand that in December 2007 the HSE sought expressions of interest from the private sector for the provision of the Primary Care <Col N="421"/>Team infrastructure, with the HSE proposing to enter into fixed term leases with such providers.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matters raised by the Deputies.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and to have replies issued directly to the Deputies.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive has designated Waterford Regional Hospital as one of two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE South.  Professor Tom Keane took up his position as interim Director of the National Cancer Control Programme last November.  The decision of the HSE to establish four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres under the Programme will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The Department is working closely with the HSE in implementing the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.  The Plan consists of four large centres in Dublin (at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont Hospitals), Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Limerick Regional Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital.  The HSE has confirmed that it will have in place radiation oncology capacity to meet the needs of the population by 2010.  After 2010 the HSE will continue to increase capacity to ensure that these needs continue to be met.  I am fully confident that this will be achieved through a combination of direct Exchequer provision, PPP and, where appropriate, the use of the private sector.  The development of radiation oncology at Waterford Regional Hospital is an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s National Plan for Radiation Oncology.  In the interim, a service level agreement was signed on 1 February 2007 between the HSE and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre at Whitfield Clinic.  This is supporting the referral of public patients for radiation oncology treatment pending the commissioning of the radiation oncology centre at Waterford Regional Hospital.  The public outpatient clinics for Whitfield Clinic commenced in Waterford Regional Hospital in March 2007.</P>

	<P>BreastCheck commenced the screening process in the Western Region last May, with the provision of a mobile unit on the grounds of Roscommon County Hospital.  I officially opened the BreastCheck static unit for the Western Region at University College Hospital Galway last December.  An additional &euro;26.7 million capital funding was provided for the construction of  two new static units, eight additional mobile units and the provision of state of the art digital equipment.  A total of &euro;15 million of additional revenue funding has been allocated to cater for national roll-out of the programme.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved and recruitment is under way.  The screening sequence for roll out to individual counties will be dictated by BreastCheck&rsquo;s operational considerations such as maximising uptake, most efficient use of mobile and static units and radiographic personnel.  The programme is designed to offer repeat screening within an interval of 21-27 months. Women in Sligo will be screened from a mobile digital screening unit linked to the Western Unit.</P>

	<P>In conjunction with the Office of Public Works, my Department is taking part in the Optimising Power @ Work Campaign. We have appointed an Energy Officer to work with the relevant Consultants assisting in rolling out the campaign.  To date an energy audit has been carried out in our main HQ in Hawkins House.  This audit will be used to develop a profile of use which will then be used to establish targets for the reduction in emissions. The results of this audit will be presented at an awareness information session scheduled for all staff on the 21st and 22nd of this month.  In 2007 all the old lighting in Hawkins House was replaced with new energy efficient lighting.  This included the installation of automatic lights in all kitchenettes which switch off when not in use.  In 2007 an environmental sub committee of the Department&rsquo;s Partnership Group  was established made up of staff across the Department.  The role of this committee is to examine all avenues of energy saving, as well as other environmental issues, and to bring them to the attention of all staff. This committee will assist in driving efficiency measures across  the Department.  Measures being taken by agencies under the aegis of my Department are matters for the agencies themselves.  My Department is asking the agencies concerned to reply directly to the Deputy in this regard.</P>

	<P>Generic drugs are widely available in the Irish market, particularly in the hospital sector.  Use of a proprietary drug or generic equivalent is a matter for the prescriber, in consultation with the patient. My Department supports the increased use of generics where appropriate and achievable in the Irish drugs market.  A new agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association was negotiated by a HSE-led team, including representatives from my Department, in 2006.  One of the objectives of the agreement is to enhance the ability of patients to have a greater say in the prescribing process with a view to choosing, in consultation with the prescriber, the medicine that best meets their needs and delivers best value for money.  The agreement provides for significant reductions in the price of patent-expired proprietary medicines.  These reductions (20% in March 2007 and a further 15% in January 2009) will, on full implementation, largely remove the current premium paid for these products over many branded and non-branded generic equivalents.  Based on expert advice from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, received prior to the negotiation of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association agreement, it was concluded that a system of compulsory generic substitution in the pharmacy, as used in some other jurisdictions, would have significantly less benefit in the Irish community schemes than in other countries but could, given the relative size of the Irish market, have an adverse effect on continuity and security of supply for Irish patients.</P>
        <P>Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services is a matter for the Health Service Executive under the 2004 Health Act.  Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the Deputy&rsquo;s request for a list detailing the cost to the State of the top ten pharmacy drugs dispensed including, if applicable, their equiv<Col N="425"/>alent cost if supplied in generic form.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I have been in touch with the Health Service Executive.  I have asked it to expedite the provision of the information requested by the Deputy.  As regards the provision of monthly information, the Deputy will be aware that under section 31 of the Health Act 2004, the Health Service <Col N="426"/>Executive must prepare and submit to the Minister its National Service Plan (NSP) including amongst other things, an indication of the type and volume of health and personal services to be provided by the Executive for the resources provided in its Vote.  The NSP is focused on providing quantifiable data on planned service outputs for the inputs/resources being used.  The NSP is monitored through a series of Performance Monitoring Reports submitted to the Department by the HSE.  The quarterly performance monitoring reports detail progress on all actions/deliverables that are included in the NSP.  The 2008 HSE National Service Plan includes performance indicators, which will be reported to the Department quarterly, for each HSE region on the number of notifications of child abuse or neglect; the number of assessments conducted following notifications; the number of children on waiting lists for assessments following notification of child abuse or neglect; and the average time spent on a waiting list for assessment following notification of child abuse or neglect.  Reporting against the above measures will be based upon the phased implementation of a standardised business process through the child care information system project.  In addition to the formal written reporting methodology outlined above, high level quarterly service plan meetings are also held between Department and HSE management teams to discuss progress on the implementation of the NSP and to raise and resolve significant issues.  Furthermore, there is ongoing contact and dialogue between the relevant areas in the Department and the directorates in the HSE.</P>

	<P>People and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services qualify for a medical card, which entitles them to a range of health services free of charge.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  The assessment of eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive and, with the exception of persons aged 70 and over, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).  The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.  As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the <Col N="428"/>Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Correspondence has been received in my Department in relation to cancer services at Sligo General Hospital.  The Health Service Executive has designated University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE Western Region, which includes Sligo.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  If diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo General Hospital.  In this context, chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.  Cancer day care units, including at Sligo General Hospital, will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients as close to home as possible.  The decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  Professor Tom Keane, Director of the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Control Programme, is currently engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the orderly phased transfer of services between locations.</P>

	<P>The assessment of eligibility to medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive and, with the exception of persons aged 70 and over who have an automatic entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants.  Under Section 45 of the Health Act 1970, medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange GP medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Section 58 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, provided for GP visit cards for adult persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the HSE, and notwithstanding that they do not qualify for a medical card, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange GP medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Where a person is assessed by the Health Service Executive as qualifying for a medical card, he/she is categorised as having full eligibility for health services.  This eligibility status is applicable in respect of services in all HSE regions and administrative arrangements are in place to enable a person, for example, to access general practitioner or pharmacy services as necessary in any part of the country.  The HSE has informed me that it has detailed operational guidelines in place for the assessment and review of people&rsquo;s entitlement to a medical card or GP visit card.  The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that every person entitled to a medical card <Col N="429"/>or GP visit card is given the opportunity to avail of their entitlement and that there is a consistency of approach to means-testing nationally.  As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for the General Medical Services Scheme, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>My Department has a general policy to use modern technology and maximise electronic communications for efficient and effective service.  E-mail and electronic storage of documents are used extensively.  Staff have been reminded of the importance of minimising paper waste and paper is recycled as far as possible.  The central aim of the Department&rsquo;s ICT Strategy is to facilitate the delivery of services and the formulation of policy in the most efficient and effective way possible.  A significant element of this is to provide stakeholders with an option to communicate electronically with the Department.  The website is regularly updated with policy and service developments.  A significant volume of my Department&rsquo;s public consultation is now carried out through this medium.  Staff use an intranet system to share information internally.  It communicates departmental policies, procedures, announcements, reminders and Departmental developments internally, reducing the volume of printed materials.  The Irish Coast Guard uses an extranet to communicate with its 55 volunteer units, comprising some 1,000 volunteers around the coast.  An Irish Coast Guard e-newsletter is issued to staff and volunteers.  Facilities whereby customers may conduct public services on-line have a critical role in reducing the volume of paper documents and promoting eGovernment initiatives.  Motor Tax On-line, the eGovernment service that allows citizens to apply for and renew their motor tax on-line, is administered by my Department.  This service is particularly relevant in the context of reducing the level of printed correspondence, facilitating over 4 million motor tax renewals since its inception in 2004.  It has saved an equivalent number of paper-based transactions.</P>
        <P>The highly successful on-line motor tax facility will be shortly complemented by another eGovernment on-line initiative.  This new facility will allow approved motor dealers to notify my Department of changes in ownership of vehicles purchased and sold by them.  At present, there are some 600,000 paper-based notifications of changes of vehicle ownership relating to purchases or sales by motor traders processed annually by staff in my Department.  The project to deliver this new on-line initiative is already at an advanced stage and the system is scheduled to go live in May 2008.  Like the Motor Tax On-line initiative, this facility will also reduce the volume of paper-based applications.  As part of Budget 2008, every Department was required to conduct an efficiency review of its operations to reduce current expenditure and to maximise administrative savings. As part of this review, my Department has given an undertaking to consolidate the use of electronic equipment such as printers, scanners, fax and photocopying machines.  The purpose of this consolidation is not only to reduce the servicing and running costs of this equipment, but also to use modern technology to reduce and minimise printing where possible.  The bulk of my Department&rsquo;s internal communication, including reports, documents etc., is already conducted electronically.  However, my Department is currently seeking to further enhance and embed this process by increasing the use of document scanning where this is useful and by the development of a print management strategy to reduce printing costs.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have received a copy of this report.  The ship involved in this incident was the &ldquo;M/V Dublin Viking&rdquo; which is registered in the United Kingdom.  Therefore, in accordance with international maritime law the United Kingdom as the flag state was the lead investigating state and Ireland through the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, was a substantially interested state.  The purpose of accident investigations carried out by bodies such as MAIB and MCIB is to learn lessons with a view to avoiding similar accidents in the future.  It is not their purpose to apportion blame or liability.  However, I do understand that the Health and Safety Authority did carry out an investigation into this incident in accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</P>
        <P>I am very concerned about the safety on board ships in Irish ports and Surveyors from my Department carry out over 400 inspections on foreign flagged ships in Irish ports each year under the auspices of the Paris MoU.  These inspections cover the safety, security and pollution prevention of the ship as well as living and working conditions. These port state control inspections cover mooring arrangements amongst other matters.</P>

	<P>As previously advised to the House, the buildings used to accommodate the staff of my Department are included in a scheme of ongoing monitoring and evaluation of their level of energy usage.  The objective of this exercise, <Col N="434"/>operated under the aegis of the Office of Public Works (OPW), is to achieve significant reductions in energy usage.</P>
        <P>As a result of pilot studies recently undertaken by the OPW in selected public buildings, it is considered that individual behavioural change has the most significant role to play in achieving reductions in energy consumption.  Accordingly, current efforts are being directed in this area rather than the retrofitting of older buildings which would probably involve considerable expenditure with comparatively fewer benefits.</P>
        <P>The main energy consumption initiative being pursued by my Department this year is participation in the OPW-sponsored Staff Awareness Energy Campaign.  This new campaign revolves around a series of staff workshops giving practical energy-saving ideas.  The appointment of energy officers for each participant building is another important element of this initiative.</P>
        <P>I am confident that these steps will soon deliver a downward trend in energy consumption by my Department.  I believe that a decisive start has been made in achieving the 33% target set out in the Programme for Government agreed last year.</P>

        <P>In his report published on my Department&rsquo;s website (www. Transport .ie), Mr. Cassells points out that while significant progress was made, regrettably despite their best efforts the parties were unable for a number of reasons to reach final agreement.  However Mr Cassells sets out a number of conclusions on the issues raised by the parties as a possible way forward for separation.</P><Col N="435"/>
        <P>Mr Cassells recommendations provide an opportunity for a final decision to be made on the financial consideration to be paid by the CAA in respect of the transfer of net assets of &euro;220m on separation.  I believe they represent a sensible solution, which I have urged both parties to accept as soon as possible.  If Mr Cassells&rsquo; sound proposals are adopted, there is an opportunity for Cork Airport to move ahead and achieve autonomy.  I have asked Mr. Cassells to assist the two boards as regards bringing this issue now to a speedy, mutually acceptable conclusion.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States below the EU minimum duty rate.  In the case of public transport services under my responsibility, these derogations included reduced rates to apply to fuel used for scheduled bus services.  Scheduled bus services comprise bus passenger services provided by Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus Eireann, private operators in accordance with bus route licences under the 1932 Road Transport Act and holders of Authorisations pursuant to European Council Regulation 684/92 as amended.</P>
        <P>While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, which is the deciding authority, has refused all such requests.  At the Commission&rsquo;s behest, the statutory basis for the removal of these excise duty reliefs is set out in the 2008 Finance Act.  My colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, has indicated that the Finance Act provides for removal of these excise duty reliefs with effect from 1 November 2008.  In the interim, the reduced rates applicable to fuel used for scheduled bus services will be maintained.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and other Departments is, in line with a Government Decision of July last, exploring if alternative support mechanisms, are possible, subject to compatibility with EU State Aid and other legal requirements.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department have been in contact with the Department of Finance in this regard and are taking legal advice in the matter, particularly as regards the appropriateness of alternative forms of relief.  In this regard, the recently adopted EU law on public service obligations, which comes into effect in December 2009, is also relevant.  My Department has also met the Coach Tourism and Transport Council, as well as CIE, on this matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 239 and 248 together.</P>
        <P>I am deeply concerned by the situation in Tibet, and deplore the loss of life there and in other regions of China.  I continue to keep colleagues in Government fully informed on developments in Tibet and EU discussions of the situation there.</P>
        <P>On my instructions, senior officials of my Department have since 17 March been in regular contact with the Chinese Embassy in Dublin to seek information about developments in Tibet and to convey my deep concern at the situation there.  In my statement of 31 March I called for maximum restraint on all sides and for the release of imprisoned peaceful protesters.  I also strongly urged the Chinese authorities to allow free access by the media and independent observers, to ensure that the facts of what has occurred could be established.</P>
        <P>The EU Presidency, on behalf of the Member States, also made clear its concerns in a statement on 17 March.  Contacts with the Chinese authorities on this issue have continued in Brussels and Beijing.</P>
        <P>I met with representatives of the Tibet Support Group-Ireland on 1 April and discussed with them their concerns regarding the current situation, and how these might be addressed.  The Group expressed their appreciation of the position the Government is taking on Tibet.</P>
        <P>It remains my view that the only way to ensure a peaceful and sustainable solution to the situation in Tibet is through substantial and accelerated dialogue between the Chinese Government and representatives of the Dalai Lama.  This should seek to ensure the preservation of the unique Tibetan culture and identity, as well as addressing Chinese concerns regarding their territorial integrity.  I would note, in this regard, Chinese assurances that any subject can be addressed if independence is not an issue, and the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s public commitment to non-violence and his repeated assurance that he seeks autonomy for Tibet within China, not independence.  This emphasis on dialogue was also clear at the substantial discussion of the situation <Col N="437"/>in Tibet during the recent informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Brdo, Slovenia, on 29 March.</P>
        <P>Finally, I would note that our concerns regarding human rights in China are raised on a regular basis in bilateral contacts with the Government of China. In these discussions, we continue to raise our concerns about the practice of religion, freedom of expression and the preservation of cultural identity in Tibet.</P>

        <P>However, within this context, the use of electronic media is encouraged, as much as possible, where it is appropriate and secure to do so.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s own Intranet and internal email is used for the circulation of material and internal communication.  There were limited print-runs of the Department&rsquo;s 2006 Annual Report (20 copies) and its 2005-7 Strategy Statement (200 copies), but these, together with all such public documents, were placed on the Department&rsquo;s Website for public access.  Irish Aid publishes all of it publications on-line and encourages members of the public to access publications in this way.</P>

        <P>All payments from the Department&rsquo;s financial systems are made electronically; this includes the provision of ePayslips to all office-based staff.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 to 244, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) was ratified by Ireland on 8 December 1989.  An Optional Protocol to this International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR), which has been in discussion since 1990, would set up a mechanism that would make it possible for individuals or groups of individuals to submit a complaint to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in regard to violations of their economic, social and cultural rights by a State Party to that Protocol.  It would not create any new substantive rights.</P>
        <P>Discussions on the Optional Protocol to the ICESCR have been taking place in a Working Group which held its first session in 2004.  In June 2006, the UN Human Rights Council mandated the Working Group to start negotiating the text of an Optional Protocol, and requested the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group to prepare a first draft to serve as the basis for negotiations.</P>
        <P>Discussions in the Working Group proceeded faster than expected, due in no small part to the work of the dynamic Chair of the process, Ms Catarina de Albuquerque of Portugal.  As the Deputy will be aware, the last session of the Working Group took place in Geneva last week, 31 March &mdash; 4 April 2008.  On Friday last the Chair noted that there was no objection to the transmission of the latest text to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva for its consideration and that, as a result, the Working Group had completed its mandate. While the Chairperson-Rapporteur made very significant efforts to address the differing views of delegations, varying degrees of concern remained on the part of a certain number of delegations.</P>
        <P>I welcome the progress which has been made in the Working Group.  I would like to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the process and to the goal of building the broadest possible support for this new instrument.  Officials of this Department were actively engaged with the Working Group, in consultation with other relevant Government Departments, and, though not a member at present, we will continue to follow developments in the Human Rights Council.  The NGO community has been following developments and I can assure the Deputy that their observations will be taken fully into account in our ongoing consideration of the draft Optional Protocol.</P>
        <P>Policy issues emerging from the deliberations of the Working Group will need to be considered by my Department and other relevant Departments, which will examine carefully, in <Col N="439"/>advance of consideration of the text by the Human Rights Council in June, the extent to which the latest text addresses our concerns.</P>

	<P>At the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) on 18 February, EU Foreign Ministers underlined that Kosovo represented a unique case because of the legacy of the conflict of the 1990s and the fact that it has been under international administration since 1999 as provided for in UN Security Council Resolution 1244. The clear reality is that Serbia effectively lost Kosovo through its own actions in the 1990s. The legacy of the killings of thousands of civilians in Kosovo and the ethnic cleansing of over a million made the restoration of Serbian dominion in Kosovo unthinkable.</P>
        <P>The situation in South Ossetia is unrelated to that of Kosovo. The dispute in the Georgian territory of South Ossetia, where separatists sought to break away from Georgia in 1991-92, has been the subject of a long-running conflict resolution process under the auspices of the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The EU supports this process, both as an observer and through funding a number of Confidence Building Measures in the region. Since Georgia regained its independence in 1991, all members of the international community, including Ireland, have recognised its territorial integrity and sovereignty within its international borders.</P>

        <Quest> if he has had a report on the elections in Zimbabwe; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The presidential and parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe on 29 March passed off in a peaceful and orderly fashion. Despite serious concerns about the context in which the election was held, and despite the fact that neither the EU nor any of its Member States were invited to observe the election, the people of Zimbabwe showed great courage and determination in casting their votes on polling day.</P>
        <P>Parliamentary results announced by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission show that President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s Zanu-PF party has lost control of the House of Assembly for the first time since taking power after independence in 1980. The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) won 99 seats, while Mugabe&rsquo;s ZANU-PF won 97 seats and a breakaway MDC faction won 10. One independent candidate won a seat.</P>
        <P>No official announcements have been made on the outcome of the presidential election. Some unofficial reports indicate that Mr. Tsvangirai polled more strongly than Mr. Mugabe, taking approximately 50% of the vote. If no candidate takes more than 50% of the vote, the constitution indicates that the two leading candidates will compete in a run-off election within three weeks.</P>
        <P>I remain extremely concerned at the delays by the Zimbabwean Electoral Commission in issuing the results of the presidential election. This delay can only give rise to serious apprehension and fuel suspicions that the democratic will of the Zimbabwean people may not be respected. I fully support the call made by the EU Presidency on 4 April for the results of the Presidential election to be issued without further delay.</P><Col N="440"/>
        <P>If a second round of the Presidential election is required, Ireland and the EU will be anxious to see every effort made to improve electoral conditions so as to ensure a fully free, fair and transparent vote. Reports of raids on opposition offices on 3 April and arrests of international media covering the election give cause for concern and indicate the level of improvement required on the ground in Zimbabwe.</P>
        <P>The Irish Ambassador to Zimbabwe travelled to Harare for the election period and our Embassy in Pretoria continues to monitor the situation closely. Policy change is urgently needed in Zimbabwe and Ireland stands ready to support that change process, if and when it begins.</P>

	<P>The reports to which the Deputy refers relate to internal audit work by the Evaluation and Audit Unit of Irish Aid. Internal audit is a key element of the governance arrangements for the Aid Programme. The practice with internal audits is that the Unit operates in a confidential manner in order to help ensure that its ability to operate effectively is not inhibited in any way. This approach, which involves using internal audits as a management tool, assists and facilitates Irish Aid in strengthening internal control and oversight systems in partner organisations, which, in turn, contributes to the governance and overall effectiveness of the Aid Programme.</P>
        <P>The work of the Evaluation and Audit Unit is overseen by the Department&rsquo;s independent Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also meets regularly with the Secretary General and, annually, with the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid remains fully committed to transparency and, in this regard, publishes many key reports. These include: the Annual Report of the Audit Committee (the 2006 report is available at www.dfa.ie ), Value for Money Reviews, major programme evaluations and other policy documents.</P>
        <P>The Aid Programme focuses on poverty alleviation among the poorest people of the world, including through the provision of funding to non-governmental organisations for sustainable development programmes and projects. Finally, in response to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question on Cuba, Irish Aid has channelled funding to Cuba in the past through UNICEF and Tr&oacute;caire but has currently no requests before it for funding.</P>

	<P>The Department promotes energy saving on an ongoing basis. It is participating in the recently launched &ldquo;Optimising Power @ Work&rdquo;, the Staff Energy Awareness Campaign, which is being led by the Office of Public Works. This initiative, aims to achieve a minimum of 15% reduction in total annual carbon dioxide emissions, through an intensive effort to raise staff energy awareness, promote efficiency in respect of all energy consuming processes and achieve best practices in energy efficiency throughout the Department&rsquo;s buildings. </P>
        <P>The Department is planning to participate in the Government Supplies Agency tender for a new electricity contract for 2008/2010 which will include requests for the supply of a significant proportion of green electricity to properties occupied by the Department.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department already uses a number of energy-saving devices, such as energy efficient lights, &ldquo;powersave&rdquo; function on electrical office equipment and photocopiers with duplex (double-sided copying) facilities. At present energy audits are being undertaken by the Office of Public Works to monitor current energy use and identify key factors that influence energy levels in buildings occupied by my Department. The results of these audits will be studied and used as a baseline against which future energy use will be measured and monitored.</P>

	<P>In the five-year period 2003 to 2007 a total of 53,976 new jobs were created in IDA supported companies.  The following tabular statement shows the annual breakdown of that figure on a county basis.</P>
        <P>The level of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland relative to the size of the economy is one of the highest in the world.  Today, in Ireland, there are over 1,000 IDA supported companies employing in excess of 136,000 people. This figure represents 42% of industrial and financial employment in the economy. The average salary from IDA supported investments in 2007 was almost &euro;44,000 or 19% above the average industrial wage of &euro;36,800, reflecting the higher quality and related higher skills of the new positions to be created by these investments. IDA supported companies paid an estimated &euro;3bn in Corporate Tax in 2007.  They also accounted for approximately 85% of manufacturing companies&rsquo; exports and spent &euro;15.87bn in the economy comprised of &euro;6.73bn on Payroll, &euro;5.71bn on services and &euro;3.43bn on materials from Irish sources.</P>
        <P>Ireland competes at the highest level globally to win foreign direct investments and IDA Ireland focuses, with considerable success, on seeking inward investment from top-tier corporations and companies within a number of high potential business sectors including Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Medical Technology, Financial Services, International Services, Digital Media and Information Communications Technologies (ICT).</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the policies being pursued by Government, together with the activities of IDA Ireland will continue to enable us to maintain the enviable position which we hold in terms of attracting foreign direct investment.</P><Col N="445"/>

        <P>The Department&rsquo;s website has, on average, approximately 30,000 external hits per week, thereby greatly reducing requests for printed material. All reports, press releases, the majority of forms, information leaflets and other documents are made available on the website, further <Col N="446"/>reducing the need for printed material.  The website is currently being reviewed to further improve the Department&rsquo;s on-line capabilities.</P>
        <P>The Department has fully embraced the potential of e-Government and strives continually to improve and increase its on-line services.  Some examples of on line services provided by the Department and its Offices are:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The introduction of on-line facilities for Redundancy Payments;</P>

The names of these companies, together with the location and estimated job numbers, are set out in the following tabular statement.  It is important to point out that there is always a timelag, often stretching over some years, between the announcement of jobs and their creation.  That time is required for such activities as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company&rsquo;s operations, constructing a facility and installing machinery and recruiting and training staff.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258 and 259 together.</P>
        <P>The Construction Industry (Pension Assurance and Sick Pay) Registered Employment Agreement (REA) requires employers in the construction sector to become and remain a party to a contributory pension scheme approved by the Revenue Commissioners and sets out the conditions upon which pension and mortality payments are payable and the associated minimum amounts and benefits.  The REA does not specify any  particular pension scheme to apply but rather sets out the general criteria within which any such scheme should operate. The number of employers in the construction sector registered with the Revenue  Commissioners  is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The Construction Workers Pension Scheme (generally referred to as CWPS) has been established on foot of the Registered Employment Agreement. While it is not a legal requirement for employers and employees in the construction industry to pay into this particular scheme, it is, as already mentioned, a legal requirement that employers provide for pension, mortality and sick benefits for those workers to whom the REA applies. The conditions upon which such pension, mortality and sick pay benefits are payable and the amounts thereof must not be less favourable than those which are set out in the REA.</P>
        <P>The CWPS is an independently run occupational scheme. Accordingly, my Department does not have the registration details requested by the Deputy. Neither does my Department have details of the numbers of people registered with the Revenue Commissioners.</P><Col N="448"/>
        <P>I have had no indication that monitoring of the scheme has broken down. As I understand it, enforcement of the provisions of a Registered Employment Agreement may be effected by direct complaint to the Labour Court.  A trade union may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a Registered Employment Agreement.  If, after investigating a complaint, the Court is satisfied that an employer is in breach of a Registered Employment Agreement the Court may by order direct compliance with the agreement.  Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine. These safeguards are in place to ensure the satisfactory operation of the pension schemes and to ensure that non-compliant employers are discovered and do not benefit in any way from their avoidance of their obligations.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency (CIMA) which was established by the Construction Industry Federation and ICTU monitors compliance with the REA with a view to ensuring that employers register their employees in the Scheme and pay the weekly contributions on the employees&rsquo; behalf.  CIMA engages trade union monitors to follow up on cases of non-compliance and to bring proceedings where required.</P>
        <P>As a further element of enforcement, The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 provides for the sharing of relevant employment data between the Offices of the Revenue Commissioners, The Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment.  This legislation enables NERA&rsquo;s inspection services to join with inspectors from the Department and the Revenue Commissioners to form Joint Investigation Units and exchange information. This will facilitate further additional inspection and enforcement activity in regard to compliance with the REA, as necessary.</P>
        <P>I understand that under the Pensions Act 1990, the Pensions Board has power to investigate the state and conduct of Irish Pension schemes so as to ensure that all involved comply with their obligations.  This provides an additional layer of enforcement and protection.  The Deputy might be aware of a recent case where the Pensions Board took a company in the construction sector to Court to require it to pay arrears of pension contributions to a scheme and succeeded in securing a judgement in the High Court directing the company to pay up &euro;186,000 in arrears of contributions to CWPS.  	</P>

I look forward to my Department, its Offices and the State Agencies that come under the aegis of the Department being able to make their contributions to achieving that target in any mandatory programme devised for the public sector by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Office of Public Works, all of whom will have the main responsibility for implementing the proposal in the Programme for Government.</P>

	<P>My Department works with other Governments Departments, State agencies and other interests to ensure that <Col N="450"/>the development of training policy takes account of the requirements of employers and workers and to ensure that training programmes respond to and cater for those requirements.

        <P>Key agencies in delivering supports and services to employers and employees to assist them in upskilling are F&Aacute;S and Skillnets.

The programme aims to encourage employees to increase their competency levels and promote an ethos of lifelong learning in the workplace. It also aims to enable employees to cope with ongoing change in work practices.  Since its launch in September 2005 the programme has had a significant impact and is expected to provide training to approximately 31,000 people in the course of this year alone.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Workplace Basic Education Fund was initiated by the Government in 2005.  It is operated by F&Aacute;S.  This fund targets workers with lower skills levels and particularly those with difficulties with literacy and numeracy issues. This year the fund will have an allocation of &euro;3.11 million and is expected to support training for about 2,000 workers.</P>
        <P>In addition, Skillnets supports networks of enterprises to engage in training under the Networks Training Programme. These are led and managed by representatives of participating enterprises and have created and delivered training programmes for a range of industry and service sectors.  This programme was piloted in 1999 and following its success it was decided in 2005 to place it on a more permanent basis.</P>
        <P>Skillnets has to date supported over 10,000 Irish enterprises, involved in over 150 networks, in improving the range, scope and quality of training available.  More than 50,000 workers have benefited.  This year my Department, through the National Training Fund will invest in excess of &euro;26 million in the programme.  This will allow training to be provided to approximately 48,000 people.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland also provides support to employers wishing to improve their own skills and competencies or those of their workers.  They achieve this by creating capability in companies in three ways:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />World class group management development programmes</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Connecting client company executives with world class expertise in the form of mentors and international advisors</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Direct investment in management development and training as part of a client company development plan</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Enterprise Ireland evaluates their programmes on a yearly basis in accordance with their clients needs.  This year they expect to support approximately 525 people on their training/education programmes at a total public cost of &euro;6.7 million.</P>
        <P>To oversee the effective co-ordination and management of the various training programmes, my Department convenes an Upskilling Co-ordination Group. This brings together representatives of F&Aacute;S, Skillnets, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards with the purpose of ensuring that the impact realised from the State&rsquo;s increased investments in this area is maximized.</P><Col N="451"/>
        <P>In addition I am aware that the Department of Education and Science also supports employees upskilling requirements through the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI).  BTEI students can also avail themselves of childcare and educational guidance services of Vocational Education Committees.  The BTEI was first introduced in 2002.  Reports from the VECs testify to its success.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> the countries to which Irish jobs have been relocated in the past three years; if the underlying causes have been identified; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13386/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many factors that influence a firm&rsquo;s decision to relocate.  Firms adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, accessing technology or other competitive considerations.  The result is flows of investment and employment across borders.  Ireland successfully manages this process, while winning many prestigious and value added investment, and enterprise policies have enabled the economy to replace lost jobs with others of equal or higher value.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to audit the extent to which job losses in the economy arise due to firms relocating abroad.  Information received by the enterprise development agencies from client companies which have closed plants or downsized their workforces suggests that job losses have been attributable to a range of factors including loss of contracts or a drop in demand for products, restructuring and rationalisation within companies and relocation of operations abroad.  The last mentioned of these factors, according to the feedback from these companies, has been a relatively minor factor.</P>
        <P>What establishes the competitive credentials of the economy is our ability to replace quality jobs with others that are of the same or higher skill level.  There is also no doubt that labour markets are changing at an increasingly fast pace due mainly to the impacts of globalisation, immigration and demographic factors.  We are responding with new policies and new opportunities for our labour force.  Labour market programmes play an important role by providing the skills needed for unemployed persons to get back to work while at the same time providing the skilled labour needed by employers to improve their productivity.</P>
        <P>The relocation of businesses within particular types of industry is a reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as Ireland.  There are benefits and costs resulting from globalisation.  The clearest demonstration of the benefits to Ireland from globalisation is illustrated by inward Foreign Direct Investment.  It should be noted that in addition to attracting foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland also places significant focus on embedding existing multinational enterprises in Ireland, by encouraging such enterprises to increase the scale of Irish subsidiaries, and to also expand the range of activities undertaken in Irish subsidiaries to include less mobile types of operations (e.g. R&amp;D activities, Supply Chain Management etc.  According to the IDA, 34% of foreign investments in 2007 were expansions to existing facilities.  This process of embedding subsidiaries of multinational enterprises makes relocation less likely.  I am satisfied that we are taking the measures needed to meet the challenges of global competition.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fully supportive of the commitment in the Programme for Government for the Public Sector to lead the way on energy efficiency.  I understand my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will respond in relation to the policy in general.    </P>
        <P>In so far as my Department is concerned it currently occupies four buildings, two of which are located in Dublin at Kildare Street and South Frederick Street where my Department is not the main tenant in either building.  This limits the action that can be taken directly by my Department to make these buildings more energy efficient.  The energy bills are based on an agreed fixed proportion of the overall bills for the buildings.</P>
        <P>The National Archives which are part of my Department are located at Bishop Street.  The fourth building is at Fossa in County Kerry, which accommodates an advance party of staff in the context of decentralisation of my Department to Killarney.</P>
        <P>My Department has taken a range of measures to improve energy efficiency.  During 2007, an Energy Efficiency Committee was established in my Department in the context of the Partnership process to examine energy usage and raise awareness among staff of the need for energy efficiency.  In conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s Power of One campaign, the committee organised a number of presentations for staff to outline tips on energy saving actions, both at work and in the home.</P>
        <P>An Efficiency Suggestions Scheme competition was also held, which invited staff members to make suggestions on making the Department more energy efficient.  I was delighted to personally present the prizes for the best suggestions to staff in July last year.  All suggestions submitted have been published and provided to staff in my Department.</P><Col N="454"/>
        <P>These initiatives resulted in notices being placed at electrical equipment and light switches to remind staff to switch off lights and equipment to save energy.  Staff are requested to switch off information technology and any electrical office equipment when not in use and particularly at the end of the working day.  Furthermore, all personal computer monitor screens purchased by my Department in 2007 are flat-screen technology, which are far more energy efficient than the old Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors used.</P>
        <P>Where my Department is the only tenant, in the building in Fossa, it has recently signed up to the Government electricity contract on a Green supply, which comes from renewable energy sources.  It has also reduced the exterior lighting of the building to ensure that as soon as the building and car park has been vacated of staff, all the exterior lighting can be switched off, with just a single light over the front door remaining on all night for security purposes.  Previously the full exterior lights had remained on throughout the night.  The energy used in this building is monitored by an officer located locally in the Human Resources Unit. However, as the Green supply has just recently commenced, it is too early to establish any trends in the levels of electricity used.</P>
        <P>The National Archives has consistently adopted a proactive approach to energy efficiency.  Various energy saving measures are in place including the heating operating only when the building is occupied.  A system is in place for office lighting to be extinguished at close of business each working day, motion sensor lighting is in place in all emergency staircases and in certain storage areas and there are plans to extend motion sensor lighting to all storage areas.  In addition, the National Archives has just signed up to the OPW Energy Conservation Initiative, managed by Vector Workplace and Facilities Management, with the objective of reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions by 15% in the Bishop Street premises.</P>
        <P>My Department does not have a separate capital budget dedicated to energy efficiency projects.</P>
        <P>In the context of the implementation of decentralisation, construction is currently underway on a new headquarters in Killarney, which will be a &ldquo;green&rdquo; building, which will provide a pleasant working environment and yet be economical to run.  The design of the building, which has been carefully conceived in line with an exacting brief provided by the Office of Public Works, makes use of many environmentally friendly and energy saving features in line with best practice, nationally and internationally.  This building is being funded by the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s new IT Strategy for 2008-2010, which is currently in preparation, will address all possible means of maximising IT facilities and communications in terms of energy efficiency and making my Department more environmentally friendly.</P>

        <P LI="1">7. <Miles com="ix" />Arrangements should be put in place to systematically record data which would help inform policy in this area, particularly in respect of applications for rent supplement which are refused and appealed as well as those which are approved.</P>
        <P LI="1">8. <Miles com="ix" />The Group particularly welcomes the announcement of July 2004 of the new initiative to meet the long-term housing needs of rent supplement recipients.  These new measures will refocus the rent supplement scheme on meeting short-term income needs while the local authorities will assume responsibility for long-term housing needs.  The new initiative and supporting institutional arrangements provide the appropriate framework within which to implement the recommendations set out in this report.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Many of the recommendations agreed by the group have been addressed by the introduction of the Rental Accommodation Scheme which was introduced by the Government in July 2004.  This gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more, on a phased implementation basis.  Housing authorities can meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of <Col N="457"/>approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, a public/private partnership type rental accommodation scheme.</P>
        <P>Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicate that to February 2008, local authorities have transferred some 6,172 rent supplement recipient cases to RAS units, 2,926 in the voluntary and co-operative housing sector and 3,246 in private rental accommodation.  Local authorities have also transferred a further 5,808 recipients to other social housing options.  The objective under RAS is that local authorities will have completed the transfer of rent supplement recipients with long-term housing needs to their care by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>When the new rental assistance arrangements have been fully implemented it is expected that in excess of 30,000 individuals will have transferred from the rent supplement scheme to the local authorities under the rental accommodation scheme or other social housing schemes.  This will enable the rent supplement scheme to revert to its original objective, namely that of a short term income support scheme.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government also includes commitments to reduce long-term reliance on rent supplement.  This will be done mainly by keeping the standard means test for rent supplement under review to provide enhanced financial incentives for people taking up employment or other professional options and by providing long-term housing solutions under the rental accommodation scheme and otherwise.</P>
        <P>The rent supplement means test has seen significant improvements in the meantime, with most recent improvements effective from June 2007.  Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  This ensures that those who participate in employment of up to 30 hours per week or in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</P>
        <P>In addition, rent supplement may continue to be paid to a person who engages in full time employment (over 30 hours per week), subject to their satisfying the improved means testing arrangements, as outlined above, and where they have been accepted as having a long term housing need under the rental accommodation scheme.</P>
        <P>I intend to keep the rent supplement scheme under review and my Department will be working closely with the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</P>

        <P>The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Disability allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both medical assessment and a means test.</P>
        <P>The time taken to process a disability allowance claim includes three important elements; the time taken to carry out a medical examination of the claimant, where this is required, investigation of the claimant&rsquo;s means by a Social Welfare Inspector which can necessitate a visit to the claimant&rsquo;s home and the claim decision process.  Once entitlement is decided the claim is put into payment and any arrears issue shortly afterwards.</P>
        <P>The performance standard for disability allowance is 70% of claims to be decided in 9 weeks.  This standard was set on the basis of 12,000 applications per annum.</P>
        <P>There has been a continuous upward trend in recent years in applications for Disability Allowance.  The Department received 17,581 new applications in 2006 and 19,989 in 2007.  To date in 2008, some 4,440 applications have been received.</P>

Once entitlement is decided the claim is put into payment and any arrears issue shortly afterwards.</P>
        <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of jobseekers allowance. He made an application for disability allowance on 12th September, 2007.  The application was referred to a Social Welfare Inspector to determine the means position.  The person concerned was also referred to medical review and assessment section in November 2007 for medical assessment.  The application was reviewed initially by a Medical Assessor who determined that the applicant should be assessed in person.</P>
        <P>Medical review and assessment section currently operate 54 medical assessment centres throughout the country.  The frequency of usage of each centre depends on various factors such as the number of cases on hand, the number of cases requiring urgent attention and the availability to the centre, of nurse-attendants and of medical assessors.  However, in view of the fact, that he would be seen at an earlier date in Ballina, he has been offered and accepted the option of an assessment in Ballina.</P>
        <P>As a general rule, priority status is afforded to those claimants who are not already in receipt of a payment from the Department. In the case of rural locations that are scheduled for assessment less frequently than larger urban areas, every effort is made to ensure that claimants who are not in receipt of a payment from the Department or who are appealing decisions, are scheduled for the nearest urban area.</P>

	<P>My Department relies on the Office of Public Works for the provision of accommodation including maintenance and refurbishment, which includes the provision of efficient heating and lighting in offices.  The Department, endeavours to operate heating and lighting systems in the most efficient manner.</P>
        <P>The OPW already has an energy awareness programme underway in all large State Buildings including those occupied by my Department.  Based on an advanced pilot programme completed last year this is expected to achieve 15% savings on an annual basis.  This energy reduction programme is the first step in achieving the 2020 target of 33%.  My Department has also appointed an Energy Officer who will have responsibility for implementing any recommendations made under the programme.</P>
        <P>The progress to date has mainly been putting the energy awareness programme in place and it is expected that it will be several months before any quantifiable progress will be evident. <Col N="466"/> It is expected that considerable progress will be made in the next heating season beginning next September.</P>
        <P>An essential part of the energy reduction plan is to monitor energy usage.  The OPW provides a monitoring service to this Department using a web based logging system which has been installed in advance of the energy awareness programme in the targeted State buildings.</P>
        <P>For the present there is no OPW programme to undertake refurbishment work solely on the basis of energy conservation.  It has been advised by the OPW that such a programme may be necessary in the future.  However where refurbishment is necessary or planned energy saving will be considered in the designs and any reasonable or economic improvements shall be incorporated.</P>
        <P>There is no capital budget for energy efficiency measures in this Department as, under the Department of Finance guidelines, such a budget is appropriate to the Office of Public Works.</P>

The finished report is currently with me and I am in the process of examining it prior to its release to industry. </P>
        <P>Anecdotal evidence would suggest that a draft of the Rising Tide may have found its way into the public domain.

	<P>An application from the person named was received on 28 January 2008.  Assuming that the application is valid, her start date in REPS will be 1 February 2008.  Her REPS 4 payment in 2008 will relate to the number of months in 2008 covered by her new contract, which will be 11 months, and she will receive 75% of her payment when all administrative checks for REPS and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.   In practice, this is likely to be in early autumn.</P>
        <P>The remaining 25% payment will go out when the last of the year&rsquo;s REPS on-farm inspections has taken place.  This means that these payments are likely to be processed in December.

	<P>My Department is responsible for the administration of the Foreshore Act 1933, including the issue of leases and licences for Offshore Windfarms.</P>
        <P>A Foreshore Lease application to construct an Offshore Electricity Generating station will include an extensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In order to determine whether sufficient information has been presented by the developers in their application, a rigorous assessment of the application and EIS is undertaken, both within the Department and by statutory consultees such as the National parks and Wildlife Service.</P>
        <P>Once the Department is satisfied that the application is sufficiently detailed, a public consultation process takes place lasting two months. Recent applications have seen over one hundred and twenty organisations consulted. The commencement of the public consultation will be advertised in national and regional newspapers and on the Department&rsquo;s web site. The public consultation phase lasts two months which is consistent with the onshore windfarm consultation process.</P>
        <P>The EIS and the consultation submissions are considered by the Marine Licence Vetting Committee (MLVC). This is a committee comprised of a number of specialists qualified to assess the application, including marine scientists and engineers. It is only following the very rigorous examination outlined above that a recommendation is prepared for the Minister on whether a lease should or should not be granted. In addition my Department assesses, on an ongoing basis, the adequacy of the procedures involved.</P>
        <P>The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 for all energy developments (including oil, gas, wave, wind and tidal energy) on the foreshore would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.</P>

	<P>The Irish rendering industry produced 151,000 tonnes of meat and bone-meal (MBM) in 2007.  The use or disposal of this material is strictly controlled under Regulation (EC) No. 1774 of 2002. The Regulation classifies animal by-products into three risk categories, ranging from Category 1 (high risk) material to Category 3 (which poses little or no risk). The Regulation approves a number of disposal methods for animal by-products, depending on their category. </P>
        <P>The bulk of MBM produced in this country continues to be disposed of by way of export for incineration.  My policy is to encourage safe alternative uses of MBM in Ireland. A growing proportion is being used as a replacement for fossil fuel in a cement manufacturing plant. Category 3 MBM can also be incorporated in technical products or petfood; and I am aware of proposals to use MBM to fuel power plants and in the production of fertiliser</P>
        <P>Commission Regulation 181 of 2006 allowed the application of MBM based fertilisers subject to a grazing restriction of 21 days. The Regulation further permits Member States to introduce stricter national controls. Landspread of organic fertilisers containing Category 3 MBM is permitted in this country under S.I. No. 615 of 2006 subject to a number of controls, including</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a requirement that the fertiliser go through a process of technical transformation to render it unpalatable to animals;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a 3-year prohibition on grazing by farmed animals where the fertiliser is applied;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a 12-month prohibition on making silage or hay where the material is applied;</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 310 to 312, inclusive, 316 and 320 together.</P>
        <P>The negotiations on the next WTO Round have entered another intensive phase as efforts continue to reach a full and final agreement by the end of 2008.   There is no doubt that the outcome of these negotiations will represent a significant challenge for EU and Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>The 2003 Reform of the CAP was undertaken with this Round of WTO negotiations clearly in mind.  The move to non-trade distorting decoupled payments has allowed the EU make significant commitments in these negotiations in relation to reductions in the trade distorting supports such as market and price supports.  The 2003 CAP Reforms also represent the limit of the EU Commission&rsquo;s negotiating position in these negotiations. This negotiating position <Col N="473"/>has been approved by the EU Council of Ministers and has been reiterated on several occasions by the Council.  Any WTO agreement which would result in a further reform of the CAP would exceed this negotiating position and would be unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I will continue to insist that the Commission respects this negotiating position in these discussions.  The Common Agricultural Policy remains a cornerstone of the EU and the principles on which this policy is based are even more valid given the dynamics of the current global economy.  My priorities in these negotiations are to ensure that Irish agricultural products remain competitive on EU and world markets.  This can be achieved by securing appropriate levels of import protection for the EU market and ensuring that there is full parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies used by other exporting countries such as state trading enterprises, food aid and export credits.</P>
        <P>These negotiations are ongoing and there are a number of significant issues which remain unresolved. It would therefore be difficult at this point to analyse the overall impact on the Irish economy.  The Commission has however recently provided some details of its assessment of the impact of the proposals made last February by the Chairman of the WTO Agriculture Committee.  This analysis is currently the subject of discussion between Member States and the Commission.  In addition some independent assessments are likely to emerge in the near future.  In these circumstances I think it better, from both a technical and negotiating standpoint, to await further clarification from the Commission and input from other sources before drawing detailed conclusions on the likely impact of a possible trade deal, the details of which are not yet known.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated repeatedly I am concerned with the current direction of the negotiations.  The latest paper issued by the Chair of the Agriculture Committee includes a number of proposals which could have serious consequences for EU agriculture, and in particular EU beef production.  I and my Government colleagues have and will continue to take every opportunity to express these concerns in the strongest terms in the various EU and WTO meetings dealing with these negotiations.</P>
        <P>I, and my Department, have consistently and continuously outlined the Irish position in the clearest possible terms at official and political level including numerous bilateral meetings with the Commission and other EU Member States. I have developed and maintained valuable contacts with like-minded Member States on this issue.  I have and will continue to play a leading role in the Group of 14 plus like minded Member States who have come together to express concerns in relation to the direction of the WTO agriculture negotiations. This group has now grown to 20 Member States. Of course, each Member State has its own particular concerns, however I believe broad alliances such as this are crucial in an EU of 27 Member States. I will continue to work closely with like-minded Ministers in other Member States to seek support for my position.</P>
        <P>I have also consulted continuously and widely with all the main stakeholders in relation to the ongoing negotiations.  The WTO Consultative Committee was established specifically for the purpose of providing advice and guidance to me on these negotiations.  It is comprised of representatives of all of the main Irish producer and agri-food industry interests as well as independent experts.  It meets on a regular basis, most recently in late February and is scheduled to meet again shortly.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to insist that the final WTO agreement must be a balanced one.  It will not be acceptable to me or the Government that EU agriculture carries a disproportionate burden or is sacrificed for the sake of a deal.  The EU has made significant contributions to these negotiations including the move in the 2003 CAP Reforms to non-trade distorting decoupled payments.  These Reforms have allowed the EU to commit to very significant <Col N="474"/>reductions in the levels of trade distorting supports in particular in relation to production linked price supports.  It is now the responsibility of other WTO negotiating partners to make equivalent contributions. I will continue to insist that the Commission pursues balance in the negotiations.  The EU, and in particular EU agriculture cannot be the banker for this WTO Round.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The increase in area is due to a number of factors including the buoyant bio-fuels market, growing demand for biomass feedstock and the introduction of incentives to encourage cultivation of energy crops. The incentives include a new National Energy Crops Premium worth &euro;80 per hectare and a Bioenergy Scheme offering establishment grants of &euro;1,450 per hectare to grow miscanthus and willow. Other available incentives include the EU Energy Crops premium of &euro;45 per hectare and the Single Farm Payment on areas planted with energy crops. These incentives are intended to complement the measures introduced by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to stimulate demand for bioenergy, most notably the &euro;200m excise relief scheme.</P>
        <P>The future outlook for energy crops depends on a number of factors, not least profitability at farm level and the relative returns for food, feed or bio-fuel. More long-term projections are difficult to forecast at this stage. Much will depend on the rate of development of production and consumption patterns for bio-fuels over the next number of years.</P>

	<P>Fish stocks are managed under the Common Fisheries Policy in order to provide a sustainable and viable industry going forward.  Overfishing of any stock acts against its ongoing viability and as such it is an underlying principle that amounts in excess of quota taken from a stock must be paid back to that stock as soon as possible.  Council Regulation 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable management exploitation of fisheries resources under the Com<Col N="475"/>mon Fisheries Policy lays down the procedure to be followed if the annual fishing quota is exceeded by any Member State.</P>
        <P>I have had particular concerns that, in relation to the overfishing of blue fin tuna by certain Member States in 2007, the provisions for payback were not applied in the manner set down and I made by views in this regard very clear at Council.</P>
        <P>I have consistently argued procedures for pay back must be applied to all Member States on an even- handed basis, and I will continue to press for such equity.  I am confident that this view is shared by the majority of other Member States.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.  Breaches of food labelling legislation should be reported to the FSAI. </P>
        <P>Food products of animal origin imported from an EU source must come from an approved food business establishment and be accompanied to its destination by a commercial document or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the Member State of origin.  In the case of importation from third countries they must originate in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment, be appropriately labelled and transported and must be accompanied by a veterinary health certificate in accordance the models laid down by Community legislation.</P>
        <P>All consignments from third countries must first be landed at a Border Inspection Post (BIP) operated by my Department that has been approved by the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU (FVO) and there undergo documentary, identity and physical checks.  These latter are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. In Ireland BIPs approved for the processing imports of animal products are located at Dublin Port and Shannon Airport. The FVO carries out monitoring and inspection of each Member State&rsquo;s BIPs to ensure the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under the harmonized legislation, are being correctly applied.</P>
        <P>Once it has been established that imported animal product has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that Member States must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin as well as to imports of these products from third countries. Undertakings that carry out activities related to any stage of production, processing and distribution of food are required to comply with these conditions to ensure the safety of the food they are placing on the market. Health labelling and traceability requirements together with controls operated by the competent authorities which in turn are audited by the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) of the EU provide assurances that food is safe. They are a part of the EU&rsquo;s hygiene of food and feed package, the implementation and monitoring of which is carried out by the relevant competent agencies under Service Contracts by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland since 1999.    </P>
        <P>It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, Member States. All imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU.</P>
        <P>The FVO carries out assessment of third countries wishing to export animal products to EU and submits for Commission approval those where the responsible authorities can provide appropriate guarantees as regards compliance or equivalence with Community feed and food law and animal health rules. Third countries and their establishments that are approved to export are audited and inspected by the FVO with regard to these guarantees and reports of the findings of inspections are published on its website. If an outbreak of an animal diseases occurs in a third country or there are matters that indicate a risk to animal or human health, approval to export to the EU is suspended for the country or the effected region, as appropriate, until this risk has been eliminated. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list.</P>
        <P>Public and animal health controls in the area of third country import of food of animal origin are carried out by my Department at EU approved Border Inspection Posts in co-operation with Customs Service. Import control forms a part of the EU&rsquo;s integrated policy of guaranteeing that the food produced and placed on to the market is safe and that animal and public health is not put at risk.</P>
        <P>I have consistently pointed out at EU level that produce imported from third countries must meet standards equivalent to those required of Community producers. In this context I have been in regular contact EU Commissioner for Health. I have received assurances that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants. The Commission recently introduced additional requirements for bovine meat imported from Brazil to address shortcomings in traceability identified and confirmed by the FVO at inspection missions to that country.</P>
        <P>I should also add that in WTO discussions in the Council, I have always emphasized the need to take account of the non-trade aspect of market access, which I regard as a crucial element in the overall negotiations.</P>

	<P>My Department, where practical, aims to reduce the production of printed documents.  A wide range of publications and reports are made available electronically on my Department&rsquo;s website.  For example, school inspection reports are made available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  A range of application forms, circulars and other information booklets are also made available for reference and download from the Department&rsquo;s website. </P>
        <P>In addition, a new service was recently introduced, whereby short messages can be printed on teachers payslips and this is used to make teachers aware of new circulars and other notices that have been published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  This has removed the need to send paper copies of circulars to every teacher in the country.  In addition, the Online Claims System which has been rolled out to primary and post primary schools has also removed the need for schools to submit certain information to my Department on paper forms, thus saving both on printing and postage costs.</P>

	<P>The Higher Education Grants Schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  Under the Higher Education Grants Scheme an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.</P>
        <P>An approved institution is defined to mean a university, college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course, or courses, which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
        <P>Each year, the Higher Education Grants Scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the Schemes. The approved institutions mainly comprise of public funded third level institutions.</P>
        <P>I understand the course referred to by the Deputy is provided by a private college. There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes to private colleges.</P>

        <P>At second level, approximately 2,125 whole time equivalent teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to approximately 856 teachers that were in place in 2002 for such pupils. In addition, there are 561 whole time equivalent learning support teachers at second level.  In regard to special needs assistants (SNA&rsquo;s) there are approximately 1,819 whole time equivalent SNA&rsquo;s in our second level schools. This compares to 384 SNA&rsquo;s in 2002.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works is responsible for the provision and maintenance of government office accommodation.  They have installed Energy Saving Lighting (using passive infra-red fittings) in my Department&rsquo;s Athlone offices, the 9 Regional Offices and in new office accommodation in Athlone.  OPW have been asked to investigate the suitability of installing these fittings in the existing offices in Dublin and Tullamore.  Long life CFL lamps (energy efficient lighting) are used throughout my Department&rsquo;s offices where light fittings allow. My Department is committed to energy efficiency and is involved in the collaborative purchase of electricity, in conjunction with other government departments, aimed at reducing expenditure on electricity and to progress government commitments to increase the amount of energy used from renewable sources.</P>
        <P>With respect to energy programmes that would compliment environmental work currently taking place under the green flags initiative for the past nine years my Department has been using a process called the DART approach (Design, Awareness, Research, and Technology) to develop sustainable and energy efficiency in educational buildings.  The policy is driven by technical guidance documents, informed by building unit professional and technical staff, external partnerships and updated by continued energy research and development.</P>
        <P>Rather than develop a unique focus on energy design my Department has taken a more holistic approach and have developed their technical guidance on energy efficiency in school designs as an integral part of the suite of technical guidance documents.  These guidelines encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception.</P>
        <P>The incorporation of low energy design has been done on a hybrid basis by maximising natural resources and utilising technologies.  This involves focusing on areas such as natural ventilation, passive solar design, day lighting and reducing infiltration, enhanced insulation, lighting and heating controls and water efficiency.</P>
        <P>The focus to date on sustainability in schools has been to reduce the energy demand in schools.  This has proven quite successful with modern day schools typically using three times less energy than schools built ten years ago and also using less than half the energy than what is termed as good international practice for schools.</P>

	<P>I assume the application for the school to which the Deputy refers was made under the Dormant Accounts Scheme. In light of the very large number of project proposals received and the level of oversubscription the Dormant Accounts Fund Inter-Departmental Committee Educational Disadvantage recommended that arrangements should be made to transfer these proposals to the Department&rsquo;s Planning and Building Unit for consideration in the context of the Department&rsquo;s overall Schools Building and Modernisation Programme. The application referred to by the Deputy will be considered in this context. </P>

        <P>Since then, over 3,000 projects in primary and post-primary schools costing in excess of &euro;300 million have been completed. With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, I intend to focus on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008. The emphasis will be on new schools, extensions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects. In the circumstances, there will not be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of the Department&rsquo;s building programme in 2008. This being the case, details in relation to the number of applications received and cost have not been collated by my Department. I would also advise the Deputy that I announced at the recent teacher conferences that there will be a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.</P>

	<P>In light of increases in population in the South Galway area and the decision of the Sisters of Mercy to close Seamount College, Kinvara, on a phased basis, I determined that a new post primary school would be <Col N="495"/>required in the South Galway area. Accordingly, I asked the Commission on School Accommodation to conduct a survey of school accommodation in the area to determine the location of the proposed post primary school and to identify other locations where additional school places may be required over the next five to ten years. </P>
        <P>The Commission published its report in January 2008 which recommended that a co-educational post primary school for circa 800 students should be provided in the northern environs of Kinvara. When a new school has been approved a number of procedures/processes must be undertaken and these can take some time to complete. The main stages are the identification and acquisition of a suitable site, design of the building, application/granting of planning permission, invitation to seek tenders and construction.</P>
        <P>The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works (OPW), which acts on behalf of my Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, is being requested to source a suitable site for the school in question. The further progression of the proposed project for the school will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>

	<P>Adult Literacy services are funded by my Department through annual grants to the Vocational Education Committees (VECs), which deliver the services locally. The disbursement of funds is a matter for each VEC, which, subject to its budget, decides the nature and extent of the Adult Literacy services to be provided in its area and the manner in which funds for these services should be spent. The organisation and location of courses are also matters for decision by the VECs.  Community groups and community development projects may apply to their local VEC for funding to provide adult literacy tuition. This is mainly provided in the form of tutor hours.</P>
        <P>Funding from my Department for adult literacy has increased incrementally from just &euro;1 million in 1997 to &euro;30 million in 2007. As a result of this increased expenditure, the number of literacy places has increased from 5,000 in 1997 to almost 44,000 in 2007.</P>
        <P>There are a number of different initiatives and schemes designed to tackle adult literacy.  The Intensive Tuition in Adult Basic Education Programme was launched in 2006. In addition, a family literacy pilot scheme was developed to address poor literacy from an intergenerational family perspective. Last year, seven projects were provided with grants of &euro;20,000 each to develop family literacy. In 2008, I am providing funding of &euro;200,000 for this worthwhile scheme. A workplace literacy programme, called Return to Learning Scheme, has been introduced in all Local Authority areas for outdoor workers. Under the FAS/VEC Return to Education Scheme, participants on the Community Employment Scheme, operated by F&Aacute;S, can be released from their work experience programmes to avail themselves of intensive literacy tuition provided by the VECs.</P>
        <P>In addition to this wide range of initiatives, a far greater emphasis has been put on improving children&rsquo;s literacy skills in recent years. We are prioritising early intervention so that children&rsquo;s literacy problems do not become entrenched and carry with them into adulthood. To ensure a multi-pronged approach is adopted my Department has, in partnership with National Adult Literacy Association, used the medium of television to reach an even wider audience. The &ldquo;Read, Write Now&rdquo; series, from 2000 to 2005, and the more recent &ldquo;Really Useful Guide to Words and Numbers&rdquo; in 2006/2007 provided learners with an opportunity to improve their literacy skills from the comfort and privacy of their own homes. 2008 will see the airing of &ldquo;Written Off?&rdquo;, a series following a group of adult literacy learners through their learning journey.</P>
        <P>There are other special funding projects including literacy for deaf people, for people with dyslexia and for native Irish speakers in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
        <P>The Department does not have statistics for the number of adults in each county with literacy difficulties.</P>

        <Quest> the reason she insists on pressing ahead with her campaign to outlaw by means of statutory instrument the teaching method of early total immersion in gaelscoileanna, irrespective of the fact that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the INTO, and all Irish language organisations are unanimous in their call for comprehensive native research into ETI before any legal departure is made touching upon it and that research (details supplied) shows that pupils from ETI backgrounds score well above average in her Department&rsquo;s standardised tests for English; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the research to which the Deputy refers, which indicates that students in all-Irish schools perform above average in standardised tests in English. National studies in this area also show that students in such schools have a higher socioeconomic profile, and have greater levels of parental interest in education than is the case in mainstream schools.  In Irish medium schools, all subjects except English may be taught through Irish providing for an immersion level of 88-90%.  The fundamental public policy issue in this case concerns upholding the rights of all children to access the full curriculum from the earliest possible stage. </P>
        <P>The revised primary curriculum was launched in 1999 after extensive consultation with the partners in education.  Page 27 in the Introduction to the Curriculum states &ldquo;It is a particular feature of Irish primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have experience of language learning in two languages.&rdquo; It also sets out a suggested minimum weekly time framework for tuition. This provides that where a first language is being taught, there should be four hours instruction per week, and 3 hours per week where there is a shorter day for the infant classes. Where a second language is being taught, the suggested minimum timeframe is 3.5 hours per week, and 2.5 hours per week for infant classes with a shorter day.</P>
        <P>I have determined as a public policy issue that the position as set out in the curriculum, and in previous Parliamentary Questions, should remain unchanged i.e that the minimum recommended timeframe set out for a second language in the curriculum should be adhered to. Accordingly, Circular 0044/2007 requires that Irish medium schools should provide for a minimum provision in English of 3.5 hours per week, or 2.5 hours per week where there is a shorter day for infant classes, no later than the start of the second term in Junior infants.</P>
        <P>The question of deferring a decision in relation to this matter pending a research project to ascertain the impact on student performance of various models of immersion education was <Col N="502"/>considered. Such research is, in any event, likely to be inconclusive, given the many variables (socioeconomic status, school practice, variations in first language at home of students etc) that are at play here. In any event, research will, by its nature, focus on but one subset (learning impact) of what is a significantly wider public policy matter and for that reason I did not consider it appropriate to delay a decision pending any such research.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> her views on the views of a person (details supplied) that the immersion education system is by far the best way to teach the Irish language to teachers; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The comments to which the Deputy refers express a view that immersion is the best model of education not only for pupils of Irish but also for teachers of Irish, and advocate that a period of one month or two in the Gaeltacht should be mandatory for student teachers.  The comments also recommend that grants should be available to support upskilling for teachers who feel that their standard of Irish is weak, and that the Department&rsquo;s circular which requires that English be taught for a minimum period in Irish medium schools in the infant classes with effect from no later than the start of the second term, should be withdrawn.    </P>
        <P Just="Left">I am aware of a range of studies which highlight the effectiveness of immersion approaches to language learning.  However, the precise models of immersion in use, whether this applied to the exclusion of other languages, the socioeconomic profile of students, their home linguistic background, and the national context and level of societal use of the immersion language in the studies are not always clear and make comparisons difficult with the situation n Ireland. It has also been demonstrated that practices in Irish medium schools vary considerably and a review of literature in this area undertaken on behalf of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in 2006 has concluded that &ldquo;existing international research is not adequate to decide the reading sequencing issue clearly in the context of Irish immersion, either in a general way or in particular schools.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>In granting recognition to Gaelscoileanna I am supporting parental choice in relation to education through the medium of Irish but this does not obviate the need for such schools, as recognised primary schools, to implement all elements of the national curriculum.  Furthermore the achievement of the curriculum objectives in every curriculum area at each of the four levels of primary schooling is an over-riding requirement in all schools. I have therefore determined as a public policy issue that the introduction of a minimum of 2.5 hours per week for English as Language 2 in Irish medium schools should not be delayed beyond the start of the second term in Junior Infants. I am convinced of the importance of ensuring that all children have access to the full primary curriculum from the earliest possible stage. In Irish medium schools, all subjects except English are taught through Irish, and this provides an immersion level of 88-90%.</P>
        <P>With regard to teachers, it is already a requirement that student teachers undergo a period of 3 weeks in the Gaeltacht as part of their training. I have asked the Teaching Council to begin a review of the standards of initial teacher education and training and the knowledge skills and competences required of teachers in today&rsquo;s profession, and to advise me on policy proposals in the context of Article 38 of the Teaching Council Act. I have asked the Council to pay particular attention to Irish, and the need for teachers to have full competence to teach the Irish curriculum. I look forward to the Council&rsquo;s recommendations in this important area.</P><Col N="503"/>
        <P>As part of the work of the Primary Curriculum Support Service, 31 full-time Cuiditheoiri offer training, support and advice to schools in relation to the teaching of Irish under the T&uacute;s Maith initiative. This is supplemented by programmes offered in the network of Education Centres and by courses in spoken Irish provided by other organisations.  I will continue to keep the matter under review in the light of the resources available and the policy advice from the Teaching Council.</P>

	<P>When teachers apply for employment as teachers in primary schools in Ireland, having qualified outside the State, they are required to have competence in teaching Irish. Under Directive 2005/36/EC of the EU, where teachers are recognised teachers in other EU countries, but don&rsquo;t have a qualification to teach Irish, they can opt to undertake either an aptitude test or an adaptation period to meet their shortfall in curricular Irish. Procedures for the aptitude test, An Scr&uacute;d&uacute; C&aacute;il&iacute;ochta Gaeilge, have been in place for a number of years. Procedures for the adaptation period are currently being developed by the Teaching Council. </P>
        <P>The EU definition of an adaptation period is &ldquo;the pursuit of a regulated profession in the host member State under the responsibility of a qualified member of that profession, such as a period of supervised practice, possibly being accompanied by further training. This period of supervised practice shall be the subject of an assessment&rdquo;.  In the case for teachers who opt for the aptitude test, it would be expected that their teaching of Irish would be monitored by the principal teacher, who has overall responsibility for the quality and effectiveness of teaching in the school and the attainment levels and academic standards of students.</P>
        <P>Where teachers do not have competence to teach Irish, schools are obliged to arrange for another teacher to teach Irish to their class. This has been and continues to be the practice in schools where such an eventuality occurs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that this Government has shown an unprecedented commitment to training teachers in our national language both through the education system and through measures aimed at generating a more positive attitude towards Irish in general.</P>

	<P>Exemptions from learning Irish are granted in accordance with the provisions of Circular M10/94. </P>
        <P>The criteria provide that exemptions may be granted by school authorities for (a) students whose primary education up to 11 years of age was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland (b) students who were previously enrolled as recognised students in a primary school or post-primary school who are being re-enrolled after a period spent abroad, provided that at least 3 years have elapsed since the previous enrolment in the State and the student is at least 11 years of age on re-enrolment and (c) certain categories of students with special educational needs as set out in Circular M10/94 or (d) students from abroad, who have no understanding of English, when enrolled.  The scheme devolves decision making to school authorities who are required to operate strictly within the clear criteria.</P>
        <P>Exemptions under the category of learning disability require assessment by a qualified psychologist. Assessments are conducted by psychologists or medical specialists, where applicable.

        <Quest> if an arrangement will be made between her Department and local authorities whereby water charges will be paid directly to the local authorities or some other mechanism put in place that would ensure schools have adequate resources to meet their water bills; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The cost pressures on schools are taken into account by my Department in determining the levels of annual increases in the capitation grants paid to schools to meet their day to day running costs. Primary schools are now getting &euro;178 per pupil to meet their day to day running costs &ndash; an increase of nearly 70% on the 2002 rate of &euro;105 and &euro;15 more per child than they got last year. Post-primary schools have also received this increase and now receive &euro;331 per pupil. As the Deputy will be aware, we are committed to doubling the capitation grant for primary schools over the next five<?oasys _jy ?>years.</P>
        <P>In the context of reducing water costs for schools, it has been demonstrated that fitting simple water saving devices to toilets and sinks can reduce water consumption considerably at very little cost, as can other small works such as fixing easily identifiable leaks. Primary school authorities may use their annual minor works grant to fund such measures. The value of the minor works grant has increased by nearly 50% over the past two years and &euro;27 million in such grants issued to primary schools earlier this year.</P>
        <P>Second level schools benefit from more generous capitation funding and can use this for small works. My Department will consider applications for necessary large projects under the school building programme. Excellent materials and guidance in relation to water conservation by schools have been produced by Dublin City Council and are available to all schools on the internet.</P><Col N="508"/>
        <P>My Department is in close liaison with the Department of Environment and Local Government regarding water conservation and is supportive of any measures by it that will help reduce water costs for schools.</P>
        <P>For the transition period the Government agreed that non-fee paying recognised schools will pay a flat rate per pupil fee as follows:- 2007- &euro;3 per pupil, 2008 &mdash; &euro;3.50 per pupil and 2009- &euro;4 per pupil enrolled. For 2007, charges applied based on metering will be recalculated on the transitional flat rate with a credit given for any excess payment.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will advise local authorities of the detailed arrangements which will be put in place to implement this decision.</P>
        <P>These new arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place the necessary water conservation arrangements and practices and undertake necessary works to ensure that when full water charges are introduced in two years time schools will have significantly reduced their water usage and, by virtue of good water conservation, be in a much stronger position to meet their water charges. Those schools with very high water consumption will be identified and contacted with a view to introducing measures to help them reduce water usage.</P>
        <P>An information package is currently being prepared for schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists. As part of this exercise, technical guidance and specifications for the most common problems that are likely to arise in this area will be provided. In addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme.</P>

        <P>Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) and electronic remittance advice is used for making and notifying payments to suppliers.  This produces savings in stationery costs and staff time.

	<P>My Department is participating in the recently launched Government Energy Awareness Campaign, in co-operation with the Office of Public Works, with the aim of achieving a 15% reduction in carbon emissions across a number of State buildings located throughout the country over an eighteen month period.  My Department&rsquo;s offices at Parkgate, Dublin 7, Glasnevin, Dublin 9 and Galway city are included in the campaign.</P>
        <P>As part of this campaign, officials of my Accommodation Branch are working closely with consultants appointed by the Office of Public Works to actively monitor and manage energy usage. These measures are financed from current and capital expenditure.  A number of workshops have recently been held in my Department in order to encourage active staff involvement and awareness of the campaign with a view to achieving the targeted reductions.</P>
        <P>Prior to the current campaign, a number of initiatives have been undertaken in my Department that support energy awareness.  My Department&rsquo;s headquarters at Infirmary Road, Dublin 7 was reopened in 1997 following a complete refurbishment to the highest standards and it has been maintained in an energy efficient condition since then.  An ongoing refurbishment programme which is being carried out on my Department&rsquo;s offices in Galway has regard to energy conservation considerations, such as installing double glazed windows and improving insulation.  These refurbishments will contribute to greater energy efficiency and a reduction in heating costs.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s proposed new headquarters in Newbridge, Co Kildare will be built having regard to best practice for energy efficiency.  An Energy Awareness campaign for the Defence Forces, supported by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), was launched in Mar 2007 to increase the awareness of personnel at all levels of the importance of the efficient use of energy in Defence Force posts. Training courses in the area of Energy Management have been held, energy managers have been appointed for each barracks. Funding has also been made available for energy efficiency measures. Pilot projects in the area of energy management and sustainable energy have been put in place. Buildings are constantly being retrofitted to improve energy performance, e.g. installation of double glazed windows, Building Energy Management Systems, Insulation improvements etc.</P>
        <P>The Director of Engineering, who has responsibility for the Utilities budget has carried out inspections to assess progress. His office is also in the process of preparing a detailed energy policy document and handbook for the Defence Forces. All new buildings and refurbishments carried out by the Defence Forces meet the highest energy efficiency standards.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The principal functions of the new Authority in relation to property management agents and other property services providers (i.e. auctioneers and estate agents) are to be as follows: To operate a comprehensive licensing system; this will replace the more limited licensing system currently applicable to auctioneers and house agents which is based in the District Court; to set and enforce standards for the grant of licences (e.g. educational/training standards; levels of professional indemnity insurance) as well as standards to be observed in the provision of property services by licensees; to establish and administer a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints relating to the provision of property services; to promote increased consumer protection and awareness of property services in general and the costs, risks and benefits associated with the provision of such services; to establish, maintain and administer a Compensation Fund.

To illustrate this, I can inform the Deputy that the print run for the Department&rsquo;s annual report for 2007 will be one-third of that for 2005.  Similarly, a significant proportion of correspondence, both internal and external, now takes place electronically.  Nevertheless, a requirement still exists to produce material in printed format for a range of reasons, including to facilitate those who do no have ready internet access, and my Department will continue to examine, on a case by case basis, the appropriate level of printed correspondence, communications, reports and other documents that it should use.</P>

I am further informed that local Garda management is aware of anti-social behaviour in the area concerned. </P>
        <P>Additional Garda patrols, including patrols by the District Detective and Drug Units, the Community Policing Unit and the Mountain Bike Units supplemented as necessary by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps Units have been directed to pay particular attention to this area, with a view to ensuring a visible Garda presence.</P>
        <P>Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.</P>

	<P>Joint Policing Committees are provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, and there are currently 29 Committees established in a pilot phase.  They operate under guidelines issued by my predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in May 2007, following consultations with the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The purpose of the pilot phase is to gain experience from the operation of <Col N="516"/>a number of Committees in a variety of local authority areas before rolling them out to all local authority areas in the State.</P>
        <P>As part of an evaluation of the operation of the Committees in the pilot phase and of the guidelines, my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I hosted a consultation seminar on 29 November, 2007 with participants in the pilot Committees to consider the lessons from the operation of the Committees to date and receive the views of the participants.  I have also consulted directly with the Committees&rsquo; stakeholders.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department, working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, are currently working on revising the guidelines in the light of the outcomes of the evaluation process.  Following the consultation with my two Ministerial colleagues provided for in the legislation, I intend to issue revised guidelines to enable the roll out of the Committees to all local authorities in the State to take place shortly, and I will make an announcement at that stage.</P>

A number of my Department&rsquo;s main buildings are included in this project and, with the assistance of OPW and external advisors, energy usage in these buildings will be monitored by energy officers and energy teams in each location.

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.

Implementation of these is monitored and independently audited.</P>
        <P>Actions taken to reduce the level of printed correspondence, communications, reports and other documents include the following:Staff have been urged to reduce the use of paper within the office. Photocopiers purchased must be capable of printing double-sided copies.  Staff are encouraged to use double-sided printing and photocopying and to limit print-runs. Key documents, such as the Department&rsquo;s Annual Report and Statement of Strategy, are produced in electronic format only, i.e. CD and posted on the website.Considerable information is published on the Department&rsquo;s website and intranet rather than in hard copy.  A significant amount of the Department&rsquo;s day-to-day business is conduced electronically through e-mail and the use and transfer of documents in electronic format.  The continued development of online services, such as Online Motor Tax and the Department&rsquo;s archaeological website, has provided services and access to data electronically to the public and reduced levels of printed correspondence.Electronic document management systems are being extended to business units. The Department&rsquo;s circular letters are made available to local authorities electronically.</P>

	<P>Under sections 11 and 12 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002, planning authorities are required, inter alia, to give public notification of the preparation of draft development plans, to make copies of the draft plan available for inspection and to invite written submissions or observations on the draft plan.   Furthermore, section 13 of the Act requires similar public notification and consultation in respect of any proposed variations to adopted development plans.  Section 20 of the Act, as amended, requires planning authorities, inter alia, to give public notification of the proposal to make, amend or revoke a local area plan, to make copies of the proposal available for inspection and to invite submissions or observations.</P>
        <P>These processes are facilitated by the public display of detailed plans at various locations within the authority&rsquo;s functional area, and on their websites.  In addition,  most planning authorities engage with local communities, interest groups and other key stakeholders at public meetings in the preparation of development plans where the issues and the process are discussed: this is also common practice where the preparation of local area plans is concerned.  In the light of this, I have no proposals to amend the existing legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Statutory protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for each planning authority in the exercise of its functions under Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000. Under the provisions of the Act, each planning authority is required to include in its development plan a Record of Protected Structures (RPS) for its functional area for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest.</P>
        <P>In October 2007, I published my Department&rsquo;s National Survey of the Architectural Heritage (NIAH) of County Westmeath. Included in the survey are structures throughout the county, including Fr Matthew Hall, Athlone, which are rated as being of regional or higher importance. Under Section 53 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, I recommended to Athlone Town Council that this structure be included in the RPS. The addition to, or deletion of, a structure from the RPS is a reserved function and, as such, is a matter for the elected representatives of the local authority.</P>
        <P>I am advised that no decision has been made, so far, in relation to the inclusion of the Fr Matthew Hall in the RPS; Athlone Town Council, as owner of the building has, however, decided to retain the structure, to extend and refurbish it, and to identify an appropriate use for it in the future.</P>

	<P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 423 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper, statutory protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for each planning authority in the exercise of its functions under Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000.

        <P>Planning applications in respect of buildings on the RPS which are forwarded to my Department by planning authorities are required to contain all the necessary information to enable my officials to make an assessment of the proposal. Under Section 23 (2) of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, the onus is on the applicant to ensure that all relevant and up to date material, surveys, etc., are made available when submitting her/his application to the planning authority. Chapter 6 of my Department&rsquo;s Architectural Protection Guidelines to Planning Authorities also sets out the documentation necessary when submitting a planning application. As well as assessing the documentation submitted, my Department determines the need to inspect the structure(s) in question on a case by case basis.</P>

        <P>My Department recently launched the OPW led &lsquo;Optimising Power @ Work&rsquo; staff energy awareness campaign which aims at achieving an annual reduction in energy consumption equating to a minimum reduction of 15% CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions. As part of the process, energy usage in three of the Department&rsquo;s main buildings is being monitored by OPW. Trends for the first three months of 2008 indicate that total energy consumption for these buildings has reduced by 16% over the same period in 2007.</P>
        <P>Energy consumption is being monitored in all the Department&rsquo;s main buildings by Corporate Development Unit within my own Department. A range of energy consumption measures has <Col N="525"/>been undertaken, including installation of a Building Energy Management System in the Custom House enabling more efficient heating management, as well as, and where possible in main buildings, use of energy efficient light bulbs, thermostats on radiators, timer switches on boilers, high levels of insulation, a powersave function on office equipment and photocopiers with duplex facilities.</P>
        <P>With OPW, a programme of works is currently underway in the Custom House to introduce further energy consumption measures, and such works will be undertaken in other buildings following energy audits undertaken as part of the &lsquo;Optimising Power @ Work&rsquo; campaign.  Sustainable energy initiatives are also being incorporated into new buildings such as Ballycroy and Clara Bog Visitor Centres.  Furthermore, in collaboration with OPW, my Department has set high environmental specifications for its proposed decentralised offices in the South East.   In particular, the headquarters building underway in Wexford will be a flagship project with enhanced environmental standards above statutory requirements under the current Building Regulations.</P>
        <P>OPW has a capital budget for the maintenance of State buildings including energy efficiency measures.  The Department supplements this budget covering minor works from its own accommodation budget.</P>

	<P>Delivering on these commitments is a matter for local authorities and I will be seeking updates on implementation in the context of reporting progress under the National Climate Change Strategy.  I am aware, for example, from the draft Climate Change Strategy for Dublin City that the City Council has already converted 3,000 traffic lights to more energy-efficient LED signal types and intends to complete the change over by 2010.  I expect that these efficiency initiatives will be implemented by local authorities in the context of ongoing management and maintenance of traffic and street lighting, and will result in significant savings in energy costs.</P>

	<P>The establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PTRB) has provided a strong regulatory framework for the private rented residential sector. Since its establishment, the Board has achieved considerable success in the registration of tenancies, with in excess of 210,000 tenancies now registered, compared to no more than 30,000 under the previous system of registration.</P>
        <P>The PRTB has a function of reviewing the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and of making recommendations for the amendment of the Act and any other related enactments, where this is considered necessary. I am open to considering any such recommendations and I understand that the PRTB has recently identified possible amendments to the Act that may enhance the Board&rsquo;s operations. These amendments are being considered in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is currently being drafted.</P>
        <P>The operation of the dispute resolution service under the 2004 Act is the responsibility of the PRTB itself, given its independent statutory status under the Act. I am conscious that an efficiently operating disputes resolution system is a central part of the Board&rsquo;s work.  I understand that the PRTB is currently reviewing its operations and processes in the context of developing a new Corporate Plan, within which priority attention will be given to the optimisation of all aspects of the Board&rsquo;s work, including its disputes resolution service.  Having fully provided for the funding of the PRTB&rsquo;s activities each year since its establishment in 2004 and having also recently secured a significant increase in the Board&rsquo;s permanent staff from 26 to 40, which is the full complement requested, I am satisfied that the resources now in place are sufficient to allow the Board to address issues arising from its Corporate Plan and discharge its functions efficiently and effectively.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I published a draft national energy efficiency action plan for public consultation towards the end of 2007.  The plan sets out the measures proposed by the Government to achieve energy efficiency savings with a target of at least 20% across the economy by 2020, and a higher 33% target being set by the Government for the public sector.</P>
        <P>I intend shortly to establish a Public Sector Energy Efficiency Working Group to drive collective delivery of the Government&rsquo;s target for the public sector.  The Group will bring together all Government Departments and agencies.  The involvement of the Office of Public Works and Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) will obviously be critical to the work of this cross Government group.  A key part of the initial work of the Group will be to quantify the extent of existing energy efficiency initiatives within public sector bodies, share experience of best practice, coordinate action and most importantly develop and implement the detailed measures for achievement of the 33% public sector target, including performance indicators.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently finalising the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan in light of the consultative process and I will be bringing it to Government shortly with a view to launching the Plan thereafter.  In that context I will be convening the Public Sector Energy Efficiency <Col N="529"/>group.  It is clear that action is already being taken by a number of individual public sector bodies and much fine work is being done by OPW.  These actions are already contributing to energy savings.  The energy savings potential will vary from one public sector body to another but every public sector body will be expected to contribute significantly to meeting the Government&rsquo;s ambitious global target of 33%.  This will require a galvanising of all players across the public sector.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s national energy efficiency awareness campaign, Power of One, launched a specific module on Power of One at Work last autumn designed to raise awareness among private and public sector employers and staff and, working with SEI, to support behavioural change and encourage investment in energy efficiency systems.  Earlier this year, OPW also launched a specific staff energy efficiency awareness campaign for 250 central Government buildings.  OPW expects this initiative to achieve 15% energy savings.  With the assistance of SEI, OPW has established an Energy Management Bureau to monitor and analyse energy use by the 150 largest central Government buildings.  It is striking that a similar initiative by third level colleges in Dublin yielded 12% energy savings for the colleges in 2006.</P>
        <P>In the context of the decentralisation programme, OPW is committed to ensuring that all new Government offices around the country are highly energy efficient.  The specification for my Department&rsquo;s new headquarters building in Cavan will ensure a highly energy efficient building, making full use of passive and renewable energy solutions.</P>
        <P>I have launched a major review of energy use in my Department&rsquo;s existing headquarters building on Adelaide Road in conjunction with OPW.  The project involves upgrading of the Building Management Systems, reducing base energy loads, installing additional energy controls, reducing energy demands in high use areas and managing seasonal solar gain in areas under significant glass cover.  OPW are also assessing as a priority the feasibility of employing passive energy solutions in the building.  In the first phase of the project, significant works were carried out over February and early March on the natural gas heating system and on the heating management configuration.  Initial results indicated a substantial reduction in gas consumption, but usage will be monitored over the coming months to definitively establish the trends in terms of level of savings.</P>

	<P>The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</P>
        <P>Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved, including any unserved areas in County Kerry, and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the NBS procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete, and it is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008 and that implementation of services will commence as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
