      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise the following urgent matter, namely, the threat to Ireland&rsquo;s economic stability caused by rising unemployment levels, with the live register set to pass 200,000 when the April figures are published tomorrow, and the lack of Government action to counteract industrial closures that have pushed the unemployment figures up to a rate of more than 5%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise the following matter of urgent national importance, namely, the need for the Government to implement the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in its seventh report, entitled The High Level of Suicide in Irish Society, to implement the recommendations of Reach Out &mdash; The National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014, to implement the recommendations of A Vision for Change &mdash; The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, and to provide clear and transparent annual reports on progress and implementation of each of these, and to allocate a minimum sum of &euro;10 million each year over the next five years for measures that reduce suicide.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is proposed to take No. 19, Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Bill 2008 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 4, Chemicals Bill 2008 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the D&aacute;il, on rising today, shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 May.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal that the D&aacute;il, on rising today, shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 May agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What are the arrangements for D&aacute;il sittings between now and the referendum on the Lisbon treaty on 12 June?  The Government seems to be of the opinion that the D&aacute;il should rise for two full weeks before the referendum.</P>
        <P>I read a report yesterday about a mother whose daughter was killed when the car in which she was travelling crashed.  The mother called for approval for hospital medics to take blood samples from drivers.  There was an agreed D&aacute;il motion to produce legislation on this issue last October, arising from what is known as Duggan&rsquo;s law.  Is there any sign of that legislation to deal with taking blood samples at crash scenes by hospital medics?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is proposed that during the first week of June the D&aacute;il will sit on Wednesday and Thursday, and that it will not sit the week of the referendum.</P>
        <P>There is no specific legislation on the blood testing issue raised by the Deputy.  I can request that the Minister concerned provide more specific detail on the issue, and we will get back to him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I was going to ask if the Minister is looking forward to a change of Department next week, but I do not suppose that is in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No it is not.  I call on Deputy Gilmore.</P>

	<P>Where is the rest of the Cabinet?</P>

	<P>It is very suspicious.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister expect to be here every Thursday morning?</P>
        <P>He gave a reply to Deputy Varadkar yesterday concerning credit card surcharges.  There was a commitment in the programme for Government that there would be a ban on surcharges on credit card payments for booking tickets for flights, matches and so on.  In his reply to the Deputy yesterday, the Minister said that it cannot be done and that he has advice from the Attorney General to that effect.  Will he publish that advice?</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recently said that limits should be introduced for spending in local elections.  The local elections are just 12 months away, so when will legislation introducing spending limits for local elections be introduced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">An electoral Bill is due this session.  I gave a comprehensive reply yesterday on the issues pertaining to the commencement of sections 48 and 49 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  It was in response to Members of this House, and particularly Members in the Seanad who raised this issue that the Government and I responded generously to that proposition.  Subsequently, following detailed legal advice, we have now been advised that it is not in conformity with the maximum harmonisation provisions of the UCPD directive.  That is where the matter lies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the fact that some political personnel at the highest possible level have questioned the cost of tribunals, when will No. 84, the Legal Costs Bill be introduced to curtail that issue?  When will the Enforcement of Fines Bill be introduced to free up garda&iacute; to do the necessary work which they are best trained to do?  When will we know when the Health (Long-term Residential Care Services) Bill will come before the House or will funding provided for that Bill be allowed to be used to cover the cost of those people in <Col N="743"/>nursing homes who are being pressurised to pay money they do not have?  This is an extremely urgent Bill that was first highlighted in February of last year and we have still not seen it.  We need alternatives if that Bill is not introduced.  We cannot allow old people to be pressurised.  I know a family, one of whose members has multiple sclerosis and one who has cerebral palsy.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot allow a speech on this.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health (Long-term Residential Care Services) Bill will be introduced this session.  The Legal Costs Bill will be introduced in 2009.  I do not have a date for the Enforcement of Fines Bill.  It is not possible to indicate at this stage when it will be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government arrange time for a debate on its response to the report of the Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Thomas Hammarberg, on his visit to Ireland from 26 to 30 November 2007?  I say this because Mr. Hammarberg&rsquo;s report is to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe and the Parliamentary Assembly.  Our relationship with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is as a Parliament.  </P>
        <P>Mr. Hammarberg has produced a report, having had a conversation with the Taoiseach and a number of Ministers.  The Government has issued its response point by point to the eight different chapters in Mr. Hammarberg&rsquo;s report.  It is very important that we, as a Parliament, have an opportunity to debate the Government&rsquo;s response, given that it has already made it.  We are entitled to do so in any event.  This is not the issue of what is promised.</P>
        <P>We also need to discuss the substance of his response which raises very serious issues across the range of human rights.  It is important that we have this debate, which is why I raise this issue today.  There are 700 amendments to the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which is on Committee Stage in the Oireachtas Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  It would be very valuable for us to debate Mr. Hammarberg&rsquo;s report before we proceed much further in respect of proceedings in the select committee.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the Minister has given me the space to speak on this issue.  There is confusion as to who has responsibility in the Government for human rights.  My memory tells me it was once associated with the Minister of State with responsibility for development.  Deputy Conor Lenihan then became Minister of State with special responsibility for integration policy.  Where does specific responsibility for human rights lie?  Has it been absorbed back into the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which will proceed to look at and judge itself or is it back in the Department of Foreign Affairs where it is perceived as something exotic and irrelevant?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot go any further with this issue.  I presume a debate is a matter for the Whips.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government would be very open to a debate on the report.  It is a matter for the Whips to discuss the timing of same.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Which Minister will be responsible for the debate that is promised or will there be a reallocation next week?  I presume so because I very rarely delay on the Order of Business.  When the human rights dimension was accepted as part of foreign policy, it was one of the great reforming moments in Irish foreign policy.  This goes back to the White Paper.  It does not serve anybody well that nobody in Government and nobody speaking on behalf of Government can point to where the responsibility for human rights lies.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="744"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Higgins can raise that when the debate takes place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the timidity with which the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues approached this House this morning, I congratulate them for slowly coming in to give him back-up, support and solace.  As the Minister is taking the Order of Business this morning and given the opportunity he has to make a huge name for himself, as he has the place to himself this morning, it is opportune to produce the Bill to transpose the EU Framework Decision on the European Evidence Warrant for obtaining objects, documents and data for use in criminal proceedings in the context of the Lisbon treaty and all the discussion taking place relative to it.  Does the Minister agree it would be opportune to bring that Bill to the House post haste and deal with it?  Perhaps the Minister will answer that question because another one is coming.  Will the Bill be brought before the House as a matter of extreme urgency given its relevance and importance?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible to provide a date at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is impossible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Deputy realises that it is not possible at this stage to give a date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is impossible.  The next issue is one we discussed several times and the Minister has a certain history in this area given the current situation between the HSE and pharmacists.  Does the Minister believe it is opportune to take some initiative and remove the Pharmacy (No. 2) Bill from the House or enter, or cause to be entered, into negotiations between pharmacists and the HSE?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The content of that is not relevant to the current issues but I welcome the break-through announced yesterday evening.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the significant workload of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in so far as there are 46 Bills from that Department, some of which must be taken before the summer recess, I have a question for the Minister in respect of prisons.  In view of the fact that the Government of which the Minister was a member presided over the closure of three prisons &mdash; Cork Prison, Shanganagh Castle and the Curragh &mdash; and that the promised replacement at Thornton Hall has not commenced and requires legislation before it commences, will he ensure that this legislation is taken by this House as a matter of urgency?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>To what legislation is the Deputy referring?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to the prisons Bill to enable construction to proceed at Thornton Hall. </P>
        <P>A matter which the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues spoke about to some extent but which I do not see on the promised sheet is legislation to deal with spent convictions.  Is that a Government promise?  Will legislation on this issue be enacted or is it merely the subject matter of statements?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised in these areas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>To what legislation is the Deputy referring?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to the spent convictions Bill.  </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="745"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised in these areas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Prison Development Approval (Confirmation) Bill will be taken this session, while the other Bill is expected to come before Government shortly.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the appalling and substandard level of public transport in rural Ireland, particularly at weekends and at night, when can we expect the public transport regulation Bill to come before the House?  This is very important.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the progress made in the talks between the HSE and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, IPU.  It is a great relief to medical card patients throughout the country.  I have an issue about legislation.  Is the Government reinterpreting or amending the Competition Act?  When my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, proposed an amendment to this Act to address the problem of negotiations between bodies such as the IPU and the State, we were told that under the Competition Act, they could not negotiate.  They now appear to have done so successfully.  Will the Minister clarify the legislation in that regard because, as my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, previously pointed out, it affects other groups as well.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation to amend the Competition Act promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We indicated to the House that a review of the Competition Act is under way.  This encompasses a range of issues.  There were public consultations and so forth.  That matter is now being considered within my Department but it is separate from and parallel to the pharmacy negotiations and discussions.  Of course, it relates to a number of issues.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact the Minister is taking the Order of Business because I can ask him directly about two Bills which are critically important to the functioning of our economy.  They are the company law consolidation and reform Bill, No. 24 on the B list, and the industrial relations (amendment) Bill, No. 44 on the C list.  Any practitioner of labour law would tell one there is an absolute minefield of uncertainty and contradiction between equality legislation, the 1990 Act and industrial relations generally.  What is the cause of the delay in the Minister&rsquo;s Department in the production of these two items of legislation?  They are so far off the horizon that we will not have sight of them before the next general election, according to the information I received.  Can the Minister assure the House that some degree of urgency will be given to progressing these two matters as they are critical to the competitive performance of our economy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 1,263 heads to the company law consolidation reform Bill, which have been approved by Government.  It is not possible to give a date as to when the Bill will be ready.  I hope towards the second half of this year to introduce a preliminary debate in the Committee on Enterprise Trade and Employment to facilitate consideration of the Bill by the Members of the House Bill parallel to its detailed drafting.  Deputy Penrose was anxious that we facilitate such a process to ensure an early debate on the legislation.  Members of the House could feed into such a debate, which would be a useful exercise in the ultimate formulation of the Bill through the House.</P>
        <P>Regarding the second Bill to which the Deputy referred, the issues of the streamlining of the labour relations bodies and so forth are important and are under consideration.  However, the existing framework has presided over a dramatic transformation of industrial relations here, if one compares the position in the 1980s to that pertaining today in terms of the number of days <Col N="746"/>lost through strikes and so on.  Therefore, the existing bodies have performed well.  Issues have been raised in the context of perhaps merging or changing the level of responsibilities of each.  That involves fundamental issues and I am involved in detailed consideration with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, in respect of them.  I do not accept that the Bill will not be ready before the next election.  I expect we will be in a position to progress it once the NERA Bill, which is the employment compliance Bill, is passed through the House.  We will then deal with this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a brief supplementary, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his indulgence.  A Bill with 1,200 sections is not a normal Bill.  It is simply beyond the capacity of the Parliamentary Counsel to produce it.  I suggest the Minister might examine the way in which the finance consolidation Bill was produced whereby it was outsourced through the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister might consider an alternative venue for preparing this legislation.  If the staff of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is to employ their skills on a 1,200 section Bill, no other legislation will be produced with the existing resources.  I invite the Minister to give a commitment that he will publish the heads of the Bill to enable the committee to examine it and that he will also give serious consideration to the logistics of its drafting.  It is not capable of being produced with the normal machinery of government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already been in discussions with the Parliamentary Counsel, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and so forth.  Mechanisms have been put in place to prioritise and deal with this Bill.  It is important legislation, which will have a significant impact on economic and company law into the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It also relates to the reduction of regulatory burdens on business and so on.  We have given ourselves a 12 to 18 month timeframe, which is challenging and ambitious, to draft this Bill, but there is a determination and prioritisation to deal with it in my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>When will legislation be introduced to allow us to ratify the Aarhaus convention and implement the European Union directive on public participation, which would give members of the public the right to information on, participation in respect of and access to justice on environmental matters, given that this has been promised by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and also in the programme for Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to reply to the Deputy specifically on that matter.  It is not on the list of legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is responsible in particular for examining where there are employment traps.  In terms of the proposed legislation on housing, does he accept the concept that one needs to be unemployed for 18 months before qualifying for the rent assistance system is inconsistent with the employment strategy he is pursuing?</P>
        <P>The second matter concerns the regulatory burden, which he is committed to reducing by 25%.  Will he be presenting to the D&aacute;il a structure whereby we can benchmark progress in that regard under different headings?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the Minister to reply on the regulation.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="747"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The social housing Bill will be ready this session.  Interdepartmental work is ongoing in addressing employment traps and various disincentives or barriers to people returning to the workplace.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government vote through one in the meantime?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The second Bill relates to the regulatory burden.  I have already indicated in the House that we outlined the steps we intend to take to ensure a reduction of 25% in the regulatory burden.  We are happy to share with the Opposition spokespersons the timeline that we envisage to realise that objective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the comment the Minister made about the pharmacy Bill, he mentioned there was a breakthrough in the impasse.  Will someone be making a statement on this matter in the House today?  Given that there has been a breakthrough, does this mean the HSE is now recognising the IPU as the representative body of pharmacies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody is trying to raise this matter.  I have made it clear that Members can only ask questions on proposed legislation.  I must be fair to everybody on this issue.  The Minister has already answered a question on the related legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister wants to answer on it again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister be making a statement on the matter today and is an amendment to the Competition Act required as a result of this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe that consistency is futile.  I call Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>A constituent of mine who requested a file from a hospital some years ago was told they could not have it because it was the property of the health board.  I tabled a question in 2006 on a specific incident involving a file being lost to which I received a detailed reply from the HSE advising that all files would be destroyed in a proper manner.  Given that the file I inquired about a number of years ago was more than likely the property of the health board and that I was told the file I inquired about in 2006 had been destroyed in a proper manner, what assurances can the Minister give the House that, under the Data Protection Act, these files have been destroyed properly and that other such files are in the examiner&rsquo;s office?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Deputy tables a special notice question, a parliamentary question or that she raises it on the Adjournment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Patients and their families are worried and upset at the notion that members of the public have access to files to which they were denied access.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>The Minister will be aware that tens of thousands of people live in homes that are subject to property management company charges but there is no legislation dealing with the regulation of such companies.  I am alarmed by the reply the Minister just gave to Deputy Quinn regarding the consolidated companies legislation his Department is preparing.  There must be separate, specific regulation to deal with management companies.  Legislation is promised regarding agents.  One of the agencies under the Minister&rsquo;s ambit is the National Consumer Agency, which has promised a code of practice for management companies in the near future.  However, the agency has no legislative power to back up that code of practice and awaits fresh company legislation.  It appears from the answer the Minister has given that there will be no regulation of management companies before the next general election.  In the meantime, tens of thousands of young home owners are being ripped off and badly ruled by a new form of ground rent.  </P>

    <Title>Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Eirgrid) Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
     
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
  
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no dispute on this side of the House regarding this Bill, which is essentially a technical one.  I join my colleagues in welcoming it and in supporting Eirgrid, which is patently highly qualified and competent to undertake the task in hand.  It is <Col N="751"/>to be hoped that the Bill&rsquo;s speedy passage through this House will facilitate the building of the east-west interconnector between Ireland and Britain, which is long overdue.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to repeat the technical aspects of this Bill or to dwell on the merits of public <i>versus</i> private sector delivery of the project.  I wish to focus on the issue of the heritage and environmental impacts of this initiative.  While in no way querying or debating the urgent need for the construction of an interconnector to facilitate the rapidly expanding power needs of this country in the face of increases in the cost of coal, gas and oil and the potential lack of availability of same, I have grave worries about the environmental, heritage and health aspects of the initiative.</P>
        <P>The project highlights a problem which has raised its head many times in the past 11 years, namely, the Government&rsquo;s lack of joined-up thinking.  Solving one problem is fine but causing a rake of others at the same time is not so much a hallmark of this Government but an incurable affliction.  Can the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources assure the House that he has given the necessary consideration to the appalling and totally unnecessary devastation of our landscape that building the infrastructure for the North-South interconnector over ground will cause?  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the expression &ldquo;penny wise and pound foolish&rdquo;.  While it is probably easier and less costly in the short term to built over ground, the long-term implications could include environmental havoc and financial loss.</P>
        <P>Public concern is the driving force behind the study the Minister commissioned into the cost, environmental impact and possible health hazards of overhead lines, as opposed to underground cables.  The decision to undertake this study follows several months of protest in Counties Cavan and Meath, since Eirgrid announced its intention to route 56 km of high-voltage lines from Woodlands, County Meath, to Kingscourt in County Cavan.  This decision could see pylons up to 40 m tall across both counties in the 400 kV transmission system.  Such protest is extending to action against the suspension of the building of transmission lines through west Donegal and from Roscommon to Sligo.  The jury is out on the health implications of such systems but anyone with an eye in his or her head can see the shocking implications for our tourist industry as scenic routes become surreal visions from pylon hell.  This issue has been repeatedly highlighted by promoters of tourism and environmentalists.  I am glad that the Minister is in the House today and I hope he is taking note of what I have to say.  Overhead lines can have a devastating impact on the environment.  In that context, I endorse the calls by Deputy McManus for an extension to the study to investigate the feasibility of an under-sea route for the east-west interconnector, with an opportunity to incorporate such an under-sea option in the North-South route.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister how his role in energy conservation marries with the real need to preserve our boglands.  The balance between our reaction to climate change and the preservation of our unique heritage of the boglands and the art of turf-cutting is a delicate but essential link in the chain of environmental and energy policies.  I am conscious of and support the need for CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions reductions but in an era when our national identity is subsumed more and more into globalised anonymity, turf-cutters must be protected.  Generation after generation has cut turf in Ireland, particularly in the midlands where 1,500 jobs are at stake.  Turf has been a major player in the provision of power and energy.  Calls for the Minister to prevent the opening of new bogs for commercial purposes and the eventual closure of existing boglands are a blow to rural areas and I am glad Deputy Kelly is supporting me on this.  It threatens not only livelihoods but also a way of life that cannot be restored once lost.  I appeal to the Minister to take this into consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Calleary.</P><Col N="752"/>
        <P>The main provisions of the Bill are threefold.  First, it will expand the functions of EirGrid to include the construction, ownership and operation of an interconnector, subject to the granting of relevant licences and authorisations by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  Second, it will provide in primary legislation for subsidiaries of EirGrid, an increase in the amount EirGrid may borrow and for its total capital expenditure while, third, it will consequently amend the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 in regard to interconnectors.</P>
        <P>While electricity regulation may not excite many people, its importance cannot be overstated.  Electricity is at the core of much of what we do every day and it has become a natural part of our lives.  We take for granted that there will be an endless supply of electricity and there will never be shortages or blackouts.  This Bill will ensure we have an efficient, safe and economically viable electricity transmission system.  The east-west interconnector makes sense and it will be of enormous benefit to the country.  The Government mandated EirGrid in its energy policy to build an interconnector between Ireland and Britain, which is scheduled for completion in 2012.  The EirGrid east-west interconnector will link the Irish transmission system to the British transmission system, thus enabling two way transmission of electricity.</P>
        <P>Our electricity system is relatively isolated compared to systems in mainland Europe.  In line with European policy the EirGrid interconnector will help ensure Ireland is more closely integrated into the wider European energy market and it will have both importing and exporting capacity.  The interconnector will bring many benefits to domestic consumers.  It will enhance security of supply.  Electricity demand is forecasted to increase by between 2.7 and 3.6% per year over the next seven years, according to the experts and the interconnector is necessary to provide generation capacity to meet demand.  It will also facilitate increased competition in the market, provide for energy importation from the UK market and create an opportunity for energy generators in Ireland to access the greater UK market.  This increased competition will help to keep electricity prices down in both markets.</P>
        <P>The interconnector will assist expansion in renewable energy.  The proposal will facilitate growth in renewable energy in Ireland as excess energy can be exported to the British market.  Our dependency on renewable energy can also be increased, as wind turbines generate electricity from a freely obtained fuel, which will never run out but which is not available all the time.  The fluctuations in energy produced by wind farms in the case of a wind drop could be quickly resolved by accessing the large British energy market.</P>
        <P>In today&rsquo;s world we are all more aware of the importance of issues such as climate change and energy efficiency.  Our climate change commitments and the insecurity of future and current fossil fuel supplies require us to make changes in our energy policy. The Government has promised to develop our indigenous renewable energy resources and to promote greater efficiency in our use of all energy supplies.  Over the last year it has made progress in policy supports for new renewable energy resources.   Developments include moving to the second stage in the ocean energy development strategy by resourcing new wave basin testing devices at the maritime campus in Cork Harbour, a new offshore grid connection site in Belmullet, County Mayo, a new grant scheme for prototype wave power devices and a new support price scheme to ensure Ireland has one of the best investment as well as natural environments for such technologies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has doubled the support price mechanism for critical bio-energy power production systems which can bring about efficiencies both through the use of waste products in anaerobic digestion and the combination of both heat and power production in the one operation.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources stated that over the coming months his Department will introduce further measures that will promote the <Col N="753"/>development of new microgeneration systems, which will complement the work the energy regulator and network companies are engaged in to develop a smarter new grid system.</P>
        <P>Energy efficiency is the key to meeting our targets for climate change and energy security.  It will require a renewed focus, sophisticated policy tools and total commitment to change across all sectors of our country.  It has been demonstrated that efficiency measures are the least expensive and most intelligent means of making substantial cuts in fuel bills and greenhouse gas emissions.  The energy White Paper is committed to a 20% energy efficiency gain in the private sector by 2020 and a 33% improvement in the public sector over the same time.  All organisations, no matter how large or small, should become drivers of energy efficiency in their own buildings, programmes and investment  decisions.  It must be realised that focus and leadership in energy efficiency has the potential to unleash savings and wider economic efficiencies for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Last September building regulations were announced, which will require all new homes to be 40% more energy efficient.  The regulations should lead to a 40% reduction in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  The regulations also introduce mandatory minimum requirements for the use of renewable energy, insist on the use of a significant proportion of energy efficient light bulbs, and introduce efficiency standards for heating systems.  They will be good for the environment and the consumer and they have been welcomed by the Construction Industry Federation, which has been enthusiastic about the changes.  It will take time to invoke significant change in the energy picture, but every step helps.  A recent study stated that by 2020 Ireland has the potential to achieve carbon savings of more than 6 million tonnes and a total of &euro;3.6 billion in economic benefits through energy efficiency.  Proposals such as the east-west interconnector can only help in this endeavour.</P>
        <P>Last week a &euro;2 million microgeneration programme to be carried out by Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, in conjunction with key stakeholders, including the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, ESB Networks and electricity suppliers was announced.  Key points of the programme include assessment of the technologies and installation procedures and their associated standards and costs and development of qualification-accreditation systems where required; assessment of the implications of high concentrations of deployment of micro-generation on the electricity system; development of an appropriate buy back-refit tariff for exported electricity; field trials, initially over four seasons, for each of the technologies in the domestic and small commercial markets using standardised monitoring methodology to gain experience and provide data for assessment, but continuing into a second year as required; and a review of legal and regulatory issues from the points of view of consumer protection, quality of supply, security of supply and safety.</P>
        <P>The programme is intended to provide the information, prepare the infrastructure and field trial microelectricity generating technologies, including wind turbines, to facilitate consideration of future policy to stimulate the deployment of microgeneration.  It is envisaged SEI will announce details of the monitored and grant-aided field trials in the summer for approximately 50 installations.  SEI has commenced activities on the commissioned studies that need to be undertaken within the context of this programme.  The organisation will announce full details of the field trials it will manage in the summer.  This will involve technologies such as small scale wind and PV, converting solar power into electricity, which have not previously had widespread application in the Irish market.  I compliment the Minister and EirGrid and assure everyone that our electricity is in safe hands with EirGrid.  We will have safe, sustainable and plentiful power.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="754"/>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a dress rehearsal.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which is also an opportunity to reflect on the successes of energy companies such as ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na.  Our generation of politicians is inclined to take the credit for the economic success of the country in the past ten years but many of those companies were set up through the foresight of many of those people who served in this House long before us.  This foresight has allowed Ireland to become the economy it is today.  When one looks at the period companies such as ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na were established, one can see how those people were far ahead of their time and perhaps we will give them their due recognition in time.</P>
        <P>This Bill places EirGrid on a proper commercial footing.  The days of State companies being regarded as extensions of the social policy of the State are now gone and that is right.  EirGrid will undertake a very important role in the coming years.  I have the honour of being Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  Yesterday, the committee was given a stark presentation by the Institute of International and European Affairs on Ireland&rsquo;s climate change strategy and energy security targets.  It seems the institute is not hopeful of Ireland meeting those targets.  The presentation to the committee described all the areas where targets must be met.  The Minister and other speakers may disagree but in the opinion of the institute we will not meet the targets with regard to energy and other areas.</P>
        <P>The construction of the interconnector, subject to the authorisation of the Commission on Energy Regulation, is very important.  To date, the debate on the interconnector has been about its construction.  There are justifiable and considered concerns about the effect on communities of this construction.  The Minister has set up a process to deal with those concerns.  Colleagues on all sides are taken aback at the turn-out at public meetings of people with genuine concerns about the impact on their daily lives of the project and the pylons.  If those concerns had been addressed properly from the start, it might have avoided the current level of concern and agitation.  It is hoped the process now in place to address those concerns will allow EirGrid to interact properly with the communities and also with public representatives who have a mandate from those communities to address those concerns.  I compliment the Minister on setting up this process.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government decision last July to authorise the Commission on Energy Regulation to arrange a design competition for the interconnector.  This is a small country on the periphery of Europe and our energy supply is not secure.  This interconnector will allow us to connect with Europe and copper-fasten our energy supply in a way that was not previously possible.  A connector of 500 MW will allow us to connect with the UK and allow us to connect onwards.  It will also allow us to become an exporter of spare capacity energy generated through wind, wave or any other form which may be developed in the future.</P>
        <P>We must regard the issue of security of supply as being very important.  The national grid is under pressure and at times is unable to cope with that pressure.  In recent years, the ESB and EirGrid have installed temporary, large scale generators around the country in order to assist the grid process.  The campaign undertaken by the Minister and SEI in alerting people to proper commercial and domestic energy usage is welcome and needs to be accelerated.  I look forward to the roll-out of the smart meter programme in domestic houses because when people are able to see how much inefficient energy usage is costing them and how they can take charge of their usage, this will result in a proper and efficient use of domestic electricity as has happened with many commercial companies.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about EirGrid&rsquo;s policies on access to the national grid and in particular for access by wind operators.  People developing community wind farms or any kind of commercial wind farms are frustrated not only with the difficulty in obtaining planning permission, but also <Col N="755"/>with the negotiations with EirGrid over access to the grid.  The process is cumbersome and slow and does not reflect the commercial realities of these developments and does not seem to be commercially equipped to respond to the demands of the market.  I ask that EirGrid examine that process and make it more transparent for the people involved, and more engaged and more urgent in its response to proposals.  Otherwise we do not have a hope of generating the extra capacity that is required from wind energy in order to address our climate change targets and our energy demands in years to come.</P>
        <P>The all-island single electricity market is just another development that could not have been envisaged ten years ago even though it makes complete economic and practical sense.  Unless we maximise the benefits of the all-island economy, we will fail to respond to the challenges I have outlined.  The work of EirGrid in maximising the all-island electricity market will be very important but this must be achieved with an eye to efficiency and without taking on the costs of any other market.  We already have enough costs of our own.  EirGrid must examine the benefits of the Irish market without taking on the difficulties in other markets.</P>
        <P>Deputy Bannon spoke about the restrictions which will be imposed on bog cutting and this is an important point.  Many people in rural areas have a deep attachment to the bog and to the burning of turf.  They are not Moneypoint-type generations but rather are domestic users who use turf in the range or the open fire and are exercising rights to the bog which have been in their families for generations.  The SAC, special area of conservation, designation which will begin next year is prohibitive and is the cause of much concern to those who believe their rights are being taken from them.  We all know that one should never challenge an Irish person about their rights to land and if that challenge comes from an outside body, be it Europe or anywhere else, it is all the worse.</P>
        <P>I refer to the issue of unused bogs which are held by Bord na M&oacute;na in its reserves.  Many thousands of acres, much of it in my own constituency, which up to now was used by Bord na M&oacute;na to power the Bellacorick power station which is now closed, are now lying unused.  I agree that some of this bog needs to be protected but it is a very important economic resource and it cannot be allowed to just lie there as an exhibition piece for generations to come.</P>
        <P>Economic use can be made of such bogs, as has been proven in many of the Scandinavian countries, where they are put to use in an environmentally efficient manner.  I ask the Minister to examine the economic and environmental indications of opening up Bord na M&oacute;na bogs to see if there is a sufficient supply and to examine the environmental and economic impacts of doing so.</P>
        <P>The challenge presented to the committee yesterday by the Institute of International and European Affairs, was stark.  All the presentations to date to the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security have been equally stark.  We have within our capacity the resources to meet that challenge by maximising our energy potential, by ensuring our energy use is as efficient as possible, by opening up this country to other energy supplies and by moving into a situation where through use of our natural resources of wind and wave we could become an energy exporter.</P>
        <P>This Bill will put EirGrid on a proper commercial footing to allow it maximise that opportunity.  I hope the company will take the spirit of this Bill in the way it should be taken and not become a form of commercial entity which becomes unresponsive to any body of this House or any democratically-elected institution.  I hope EirGrid has learned the lessons from the debate on the interconnector and that it has learned the importance of engagement with communities, with business and with public representatives.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister and his Department on the spirit in which the Bill has been presented.  It is an exciting Bill which will allow us continue the very fine tradition of State <Col N="756"/>enterprises established by this House many generations ago.  I hope this generation of representatives can put its stamp on energy supply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Bill 2008.  I strongly support the Bill, particularly its key objective of facilitating the development of the first east-west interconnector and interconnectors generally.  This is a crucial step forward for our energy market.</P>
        <P>However, I agree with the Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy McManus, that significant issues remain in terms of our future energy security.  These include the development of a green energy market and the impact of rising energy prices on the public, particularly vulnerable persons such as senior citizens or those in low income households.  The Minister has set out several major objectives he hopes to achieve and for which the House will hold him accountable in coming years.  Regrettably, an issue in which he seems to have no interest is fuel poverty and the difficulties experienced by vulnerable households in this regard.</P>
        <P>This small Bill is largely technical but it has significant implications for the future of our energy supply.  As an island nation with a small population, we have a relatively small energy market.  One of my key concerns as spokesman on energy in the last D&aacute;il was to highlight the overwhelming importance of ensuring connectivity to other markets.  In this regard, I strongly welcomed the development of an all-island market.  Increasing our connectivity will enhance the security of our supply and provide additional protection against potential blackouts.  This is vital given the level of amber and red alerts that occurred in the electricity system in recent years.  I hope the Minister will keep a careful eye on this situation with a particular focus on increasing the quantity of electricity from renewable sources in the system.</P>
        <P>Until recently, only 330 MW of power could transfer from North to South and 100 MW in the other direction.  In the last D&aacute;il, the Minister and I often raised the importance of strengthening the grid in the Border region, particularly in the Louth area.  I hope this will be one of his priorities.  I understand the development of the second North-South interconnector will allow a total of up to 800 MW of power to transfer between North and South by 2012.</P>
        <P>In 2004, 400,000 GW of electricity was generated in the British market, which currently has five large players.  The Scotland-Northern Ireland interconnector has a 500 MW capacity, which is too small to integrate Northern Ireland into the larger British market.  However, the proposed east-west interconnector linking Ireland with Wales, with a target completion date of 2011, will have a capacity of approximately 1,000 MW.  The enhancement of our interconnectivity, on both a North-South and an east-west basis, is absolutely critical to the security of our energy supply.  Other speakers mentioned the key role interconnectors can play in the export of electricity.  I attended various energy conferences during the last D&aacute;il at which I discovered the dramatic contrast between the Danish and north German markets, for example, and our own.  The experience in other jurisdictions makes clear that extensive interconnectivity is vital if we are to achieve the ambitions set out in the ESB&rsquo;s strategic plan for 2020.</P>
        <P>When the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was in opposition, he was a consistent advocate of the break-up of the ESB.  He repeatedly made the case that the best way forward was to transfer the entire network from ESB to EirGrid.  Therefore, this Bill represents an astonishing <i>volte-face</i> on the part of this Green Party Minister.  He has abandoned the key element of his oft repeated mantra on the Opposition benches that a major generator, or even a minor one, should not also have responsibility for the management of a transmission network.  I recall the meeting in the Royal Hibernian Academy where members of senior management at the ESB were utterly devastated, understandably so, at the prospect of the demolition of that historic semi-State body, which has served the State so well.  The Minister was a key advocate for that <Col N="757"/>approach, putting forward the case that a decentralised grid could not be achieved under the direction of the ESB.</P>
        <P>It seems the Minister has undergone some type of Damascene conversion and has now come forward with a much better plan for the ESB.  The senior management of the ESB has consistently articulated its plan, which has been expressed in its vision for 2020, that it should effectively become a minority player.  In other words, it envisages a situation where it is unable to fix market prices in the incredibly fast moving electricity market but will continue to function as the maintainer of the transmission network and the local grid.  I welcome this development and the Minister&rsquo;s abandonment of what was a foolish policy.  It would have been a pointless adventure to go down the other road.  Some speakers on the Fianna F&aacute;il benches referred to it as a madcap policy in the context of the achievements of the ESB over the decades, particularly in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s when the electrification of the State was one of the key stepping stones in our economic development.</P>
        <P>EirGrid also has a crucial role to play and the Bill further enhances its function as the transmission system operator, TSO.  This enhanced role is welcome, as are the new capital facilities to be provided for the company.  I notice that the Minister&rsquo;s approval is strictly required in this regard.  He is surely anxious to avoid anything like the controversy in the last D&aacute;il when the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was unfortunate to discover that the ESB had embarked on a major and successful financing on the New York market of which he apparently knew nothing.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Ryan, will not experience a similar fate in the coming years.  I am sure he will not if he keeps a close eye on his job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sense has prevailed and we now have a situation whereby the ESB and EirGrid, two excellent semi-State companies, are being steered in the right direction in their respective roles in the vital electricity generation sector.  I warmly welcome the ESB&rsquo;s strategic framework for 2020, which was announced by the company and the Minister some weeks ago.  The target of achieving a net zero carbon rating by 2035 is reasonable, as is the objective of halving carbon emissions within 12 years.  I also welcome the wide-ranging development programme, which includes the provision of &euro;4 billion for renewable projects.  The Minister will recall the debate on Hibernian Wind Power and so on, and the attempt effectively to ensure that the ESB would not be allowed enter the renewables market.  Now, however, it has been decided that it will become a &ldquo;green&rdquo; company and that is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I note the provision for a major expenditure of &euro;6.5 billion on the development of smart meters.  Both the Minister and I were strong advocates of smart metering in the last D&aacute;il.  What is the timeframe for this?  When will smart meters be installed in people&rsquo;s homes so that their electricity performance can be monitored?  What would be the advantages of installing a carbon neutral local energy system based, for example, on wind or solar power?  In the UK people can get a picture of what is involved.  Recently, I read that a low carbon device costs &pound;9,000 sterling and has 17 years pay back time in terms of saved electricity.  We need smart metering.  When will the Minister launch this?  Do many homes already have it?  What will happen with regard to this?</P>
        <P>I warmly welcome the vision of the ESB delivering one third of its electricity from renewables by 2020.  With the exporting capacity of the interconnectors, we should arrive at a point where all Irish electricity is renewable or that we have the capacity at all times with wind power.</P>
        <P>I did not notice much on storage in the strategic vision.  Previously, storage facilities, such as those at Turlough Hill, was a major theme of the Minister and I support it.  If we continue to move as quickly as we have been into renewables, given the nature of electricity can we store it better?  I hope the Minister will announce major developments on this during the coming years.</P><Col N="758"/>
        <P>The divestment programme of generation capacity, which the ESB always intended, will go ahead.  The management would like it to become a smaller generator and the management of the transmission system would be its key element.  With regard to competition, a major disappointment to this House was that while we have had an open market for three years, none of us can apply to have a supplier other than the ESB.  More than 60% of the market will fully open up to other companies, including the other major player on the island, Northern Ireland Electricity.</P>
        <P>So far, households have not benefited in anyway from the additional competition introduced in the market.  It seems to exist only at the level of business.  Eirtricity withdrew the facility it had for households.  Deputy McManus rightly considered a major fear with regard to the Bill before us, which is whether consumers will pay for every inch of the interconnector.  Ultimately, will they bear the burden through the cost of electricity, be it partly or mostly renewable, in addition to taxation and other spending?  When will the Minister address competition issues, in particular to provide more advantages to households?  Undoubtedly, the development of renewable power is more expensive and people have a cost benefit in that they gain by having a low carbon environment.  Nonetheless, all of these costs should be spelled out and should be clear to people.</P>
        <P>I warmly welcome the new vision for the ESB and I wish it well in this new phase of its development.  The development through the Bill of the all-island market and the two island energy market are also to be welcomed.  When the Minister was in Opposition he called for a full debate on nuclear power and has also done so since entering Government.  We have not had this debate.  Why, given the law of the land, must we go back through what we decided over a number of decades is an unnecessary form of development given the capacity for wind, wave and other renewable powers?</P>
        <P>The Minister must also tease out this matter in the context of electricity storage and the base load.  The security of our energy and electricity supply requires that we have an absolutely secure base load capacity and the Minister must spell out how he will achieve this for the decades ahead given that we will use considerably more power.  It is striking that as IT industries develop and we become a high-tech economy, the amount of power used in the area increases.  In my constituency, a small data storage facility will come on line shortly and will use 20 MW per day.  Its consumption of electricity is phenomenal, even in the context of national consumption.  Will the Minister address the issues pertaining to storage?</P>
        <P>Having stated all of this, I welcome the Bill and the responsibility given to EirGrid, in particular the facility for exporting.  A number of Deputies mentioned the ESB&rsquo;s involvement in the SeaGen project on wave power.  The length of time it has taken to bring wave power on stream and have a dynamic coastal section is disappointing.  It is hoped this will come to fruition in the coming decades.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister address the matter of energy and fuel poverty, an issue he has refused to address either in Opposition or in Government?  A fuel poor household is defined as one which must spend more than 10% of the household&rsquo;s finances on fuel use to maintain a satisfactory heating regime.  On average, fuel poor households spend three times as much income on fuel as other households.  A combination of low incomes, high energy prices and inadequately energy efficient housing are the crucial factors which condemn many Irish households to fuel poverty.  Ireland has one of the highest levels of housing deprivation in energy terms in northern Europe.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s failure to introduce a significant energy efficiency programme in the nine or ten months since he took office is disappointing.  Last year, we had the amazing situation <Col N="759"/>whereby he cancelled the programme and then cobbled together money from other parts of the budget to carry it on.  It seems a totally inadequate and derisory fig leaf and the Minister must address it.  Householders contact Members of this House with regard to obtaining insulation systems and few resources exist to support it.</P>
        <P>The most disturbing aspect of living in a fuel poor household is the adverse and potentially fatal health implications for families and individuals.  Even though Ireland has a relatively mild climate, according to a UCD study carried out in 2001 it has the highest rate of excess winter mortality in Europe.  Little recent research has been undertaken on this.  According to the UCD study, approximately 18% of Irish households declared a level of fuel poverty.  SEI estimates that approximately 60% households experience persistent fuel poverty and another 160,000 experience intermittent fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>Approximately 300,000 may endure some type of fuel poverty.  This is of particular interest to the Labour Party.  Had we the opportunity to serve in Government we would have advocated a five year programme to eliminate it completely through insulation and support for vulnerable families.  I draw this issue to the Minister&rsquo;s attention and ask that he address it as a matter of priority.  We can be green and socially responsible at the same time in terms of insulation and other supports.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I support the Bill.  It is a major step forward for which I commend the Minister.  There are a whole range of other issues on which the Minister was voluble when on the Opposition benches.  I hope now that he has an opportunity to do so he will address them one by one and will at an early date update the House on storage and smart metering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I wish to raise several issues.  </P>
        <P>The Bill seeks to expand the functions of EirGrid, the licensed electricity transmission operator, to include the construction, ownership and operation of the interconnector subject to the grant of the relevant licences and authorisation by the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Energy Regulator for gas and electricity and to provide, in primary legislation, that it may continue to borrow the total capital expenditure required.</P>
        <P>I welcome the east-west interconnector.  This proposed development could not have been foreseen ten or 15 years ago.  The interconnector will tie us into the island of Great Britain and provide for closer co-operation between the two islands that have suffered enormously from historical differences.  I am glad those differences have been resolved.  We must encourage all sides to work for continued peace.</P>
        <P>When the Electricity Supply Board was founded the men and women employed by the ESB and Bord na Mona showed great foresight in building the many power stations around the country.  We must continue this work and ensure we provide sustainable energy for future generations on both islands.  Security of supply is a particular issue that arises in respect of the Bill.  We are all aware of the huge pressure on the grid and on energy.  For many years, we wasted enormous amounts of electricity but, people are now conscious of the environmental and cost impact of providing electricity to the domestic and business markets.  They know, from initiatives such as the Power of One and so on, how to achieve huge savings in respect of the cost to them and the business community of electricity and in respect of climate change.</P>
        <P>In recent years there has been an increase in awareness of renewable energy, which is to be welcomed.  We are living in an age of renewable energy.  The interconnector will provide safeguards to the generation of electricity through wind and other means.  We must ensure that ongoing development through wind energy, by public and private companies, ties in with the <Col N="760"/>environment, is targeted and takes account of the sensitivities of different communities.  We must also move forward and replace with wind energy and renewable sources much of the fossil fuel we currently burn.  The availability of a ready-made resource in respect of energy will ensure continuity of supply and will protect the environment in the future.</P>
        <P>Major efforts are being made across the globe in respect of climate change.  While many people spoke out on climate change during the past ten or 15 years, it was generally accepted that there was precious little politicians or countries could do about it.  The issue is now being tackled across the globe, no more so than in this House.  I welcome the initiatives taken.  It is a campaign we must continue to drive forward.  While change will cause inconvenience and pain for domestic and business communities, we must ensure we continue to make the right decisions in this regard.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers spoke about smart metering.  We must ensure we have energies which are important to us.  While people may have believed for many years that there was no limit to the amount of energy that could be generated, they are now aware, given the growth in our population, of the enormous pressures in this regard.  We must ensure the energy we create is put to the best possible use and not wasted.</P>
        <P>The national development plan deals with future development.  It has been predicted that our population will increase to almost 4.9 million people by 2040.  This will put enormous pressure on this generation to ensure provision of the required infrastructure and planning and development as provided for in the national development plan.  It is vitally important that we adhere to this aspect of that plan.  We must ensure we make the right decisions in respect of wind energy, climate change and how we conduct our business.</P>
        <P>The east-west interconnector has been welcomed on all sides.  It will provide a connection between Ireland and Great Britain and on to Europe.  Grave concern has been expressed in many parts of the country about the north-south interconnector.  I hope the independent review group set up by the Minister to examine this matter will be able to address the concerns expressed.</P>
        <P>The introduction of competition to other markets wherein there was a monopoly has been good for consumers.  The interconnector will promote competition in the electricity market as it will allow for third party access in a fair, consistent and transparent manner.  This, in turn, will bring pressure to bear in respect of reduction in the cost of electricity.  The interconnector will diversify the fuel sources used in the Irish system to generate electricity.  The environment will benefit greatly from the interconnector which will provide for greater potential to export wind power, reduce the need for carrying reserves and the need for carbon credit payments.</P>
        <P>The interconnector will increase the capacity of the single electricity market and provide us with a link to the UK electricity market and, in turn, the European market.  We will be in a position to attract more foreign investors who may choose to invest directly in the market through, for example, the provision of additional generating capacity, conventional or renewable energy.</P>
        <P>The interconnector connects us to the UK market and on to the European market.  Who would have thought some 40, 50 or 60 years ago that there would be such great co-operation within Europe?  This co-operation is of enormous benefit to Ireland as a peripheral country.  The interconnector will ensure we are no longer isolated but connected to every country in Europe.  That is our future.  It is where we will see our country going, and it is where we have to encourage our country to go.</P>
        <P>Prices have reduced somewhat, but ordinary consumers have seen huge increases in the price of oil and, in turn, the price of electricity, so we have to improve competition and ensure the <Col N="761"/>introduction of additional energy sources.  In particular, we need the introduction of external sources to improve the level of competition in the market, which in turn leads to a more competitive environment.  That will not only impact on prices to the end user but generate an environment in which the incumbent players have to keep abreast of international market changes in demand and to improve the overall quality and service provision in the market.  That is one issue with which we have to deal.</P>
        <P>We have seen an all-island market develop in the past ten years.  I welcome all the initiatives that have been taken in that regard, and I commend the Minister on his work on that issue and the other people who have been involved on their abilities.  What we have achieved could not have been foreseen 20 years ago.  We must welcome and secure those developments.  Through the east-west interconnector we are connecting to Great Britain and the rest of Europe, and we must not lose sight of our stance in Europe or of what we can gain and have gained from the European Union, particularly with EirGrid.</P>
        <P>A key issue is the need to seriously address climate change.  Renewables are the way forward, and there has been a huge take-up in the market, but we must be clear about renewables in order to meet a certain target by 2020.  The industry has made the same point.  However, we must ensure that, as we go down the renewables route, we integrate them as far as possible with other environmental and personal concerns that people have.  There is no doubt that one of the great untapped sources of energy is wind energy, which has been used to great effect.  We must also move away from our dependence on oil and fossil fuel, which affect our climate.</P>
        <P>The other key issue is the national development plan which includes provisions in this regard.  We will be judged on how we continue to roll out the national development plan and ensure that it is implemented in full.  Generations to come will see the infrastructure we have put in place, and will give credit to those who set up the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na M&oacute;na and other semi-State bodies to ensure our electricity supply.  We have to continue that process.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  As the Minister knows, we all support the Bill and acknowledge the great effort that has gone into it and to ensuring that we can produce our own electricity.  It is only when we go to petrol stations and see diesel on sale for &euro;1.27 per litre that we realise the consequences of depending too much on other countries for energy.  We as a nation cannot and will not be in a position to be competitive not only in Europe but across the world if our energy prices continue to grow in the present manner.</P>
        <P>Our economy is experiencing a minor downturn, and I hope to God that it will turn around sooner rather than later.  However, there are two areas in which we cannot afford to be mean, even if we have to borrow money for them.  One is the interconnector, which is probably the most exciting project any Minister is undertaking at the moment.  We cannot afford to skimp on it, and the quicker the interconnectors are up and running and providing our own electricity, the better.  The other issue on which money cannot be spared in lean times is education.</P>
        <P>The provision of electricity is crucial.  Europe is growing and I hope all new EU member countries will be in the same position as Ireland in terms of rising standards of living.  However, we must be able to provide these people with technology, food and so on.  As we know, food has become a scarce commodity, and with only five weeks&rsquo; supply in Europe at any one time, Ireland is in a better position than other countries because we have spent so much money down the years on promoting our brand of food.  Energy, including electricity, will be a crucial issue in ensuring that we are as competitive as any other country across the world, so we welcome <Col N="762"/>the Bill.  Deputies Crawford, English and I have spoken previously on this issue, and the Minister knows that we back him to the hilt in this regard.</P>
        <P>Having said all that, the Minister probably knows what I plan to talk about, namely, the North-South interconnector.  The issue will not go away because it is like so many other issues in Ireland today.  Young people, in particular, will not accept things being handed down to them, whether by the Government, the church or anybody else.  They do not like something just being dumped on them without any reason.  They will not accept an advertisement in a newspaper stating what is going to happen.</P>
        <P>The plan to locate pylons throughout County Meath was identified a couple of months ago and has caused great concern.  The T&aacute;naiste and perhaps some Deputies from County Meath said the North-South interconnector would never be discussed in the House, so I welcome the fact that the Minister has intervened.  He has taken full responsibility and ordered an independent review of the costings.  I will not comment further at present, but when the results of that review are known I will demand that they are discussed in this House and at committee level.</P>
        <P>The people of Monaghan, Meath and Cavan got together on the issue four or five months ago.  They will not accept a report which simply says that cables must be laid overground because the cost of putting them underground is too high.  The people of Ireland will not accept that either, which I am delighted about.  People will not accept streets being closed for a month or six weeks, such as happened in Duleek for sewerage works, and companies going out of business.</P>
        <P>As everybody in the country, including the Minister, knows, the manner in which EirGrid did its business early on was revolting.  It thought it could bully people and do what it liked.  We have now reached a stage in which millions of euro will be put aside for Ireland to provide as much electricity as possible at a decent price.  People in North East Pylon Pressure, who own EirGrid in the same way as the Minister and I do, are not going to be bullied and will not accept a decision to locate pylons in any part of Meath, Monaghan or Cavan because it suits business people attached to the project or others.</P>
        <P>Pylons have their uses but they are an ugly sight in any country.  When one drives up the M1, which I have done several times, one sees a line of pylons.  They do not look so bad because they are in a straight line and run alongside the M1, although some of the wires have not been connected.  A high-ranking Minister from my constituency was to approach the National Roads Authority on this issue, but we have not heard whether he did so.  Why has nobody considered locating the pylons alongside the M3?  When I asked that question at my first meeting with EirGrid and questioned whether the issue related to Tara, the representative admitted that it did.  However, locating pylons along a motorway, as with the M1, would be far more acceptable to people in Meath, Monaghan and Cavan, rather than running the line through towns, villages, fields and farms, thus destroying the area.  If the Minister thinks, having commissioned an independent study, that this will satisfy the people it will not and it will put a stop to this country&rsquo;s great plan if we do things the old way.</P>
        <P>The young people, the GAA, farmers and people from all parties have come together to ensure their electricity supply will be connected in the proper way.  Money will not be an issue for them but it may have been an issue for the Government to spend on this underground study.  Perhaps it could not hand over &euro;50,000 for a report which was supposed to be done in 40 days.  Will the Minister indicate clearly when this report is expected to be published?  Money will not be an issue for the people of Meath, Monaghan or Cavan to ensure that when EirGrid goes ahead it will be done correctly and will not affect their health, the price of houses, the <Col N="763"/>environment or the tourism industry.  This is the reason the people of Meath, Monaghan and Cavan have come together as a unit in a way I have not seen previously.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister&rsquo;s position, a position I will never be in, and that he has a lot on his plate but he should keep the people informed about what is going on.  On the three or four occasions people addressed the joint committee, the Minister said an independent study would be set up.  That was fair enough but everyone went back to their old ways and went underground and would not say openly what was being done.  It had to be dragged out here on one occasion because we got wind of it.  A statement was leaked out at 3 p.m. on the day in question; that is not the way to proceed.</P>
        <P>I will be as straight as I can on this issue.  I know the people we are dealing with; they come from every walk of life.  I have worked with them and played football with them.  They are Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in, Labour and Independent and the Minister must get somebody to speak with them within the next three weeks.  If this report comes out, it leaves the door open for anyone to conduct a study.  We will then end up in the courts which will be followed with a campaign that will continue for the next eight or ten years.  Other Deputies have said it will never be discussed in the House.  Gradually Deputies from other counties are beginning to realise the concerns of the people.  It is the same in the health area; it is the fear of the unknown.  What are the effects of magnetic fields on people?  One of EirGrid&rsquo;s representatives made a statement on local radio in which he referred to the possible death of only a few children as a result of the installation of cables and it has not been retracted properly.  That was a terrible statement to make by anyone who is employed by EirGrid.</P>
        <P>This is a health issue.  Every parish in Ireland must know within the next five or six years why our young people are dying.  Will it be because of our food, the environment, magnetic fields or mobile phones?  They will not take &ldquo;No&rdquo; for an answer.  When this campaign started in October or November 2007, I was amazed at the people who turned up at these meetings &mdash; men, women and children.  Age means nothing in regard to cancers of all description.  The people want to know whether the food chain, Sellafied, incineration or whatever is responsible.  They are far more educated than, perhaps, Members.  The North East Pylon Pressure group is six months ahead of EirGrid in regard to its PR, investigations and what has happened throughout the world and will not accept a &euro;50,000 study.  Money is not everything at the end of the day.  We are going to spend billions.  As one of our Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues rightly said earlier, this is a fantastic opportunity for us to supply our own electricity and, as Deputy Broughan said, to export our electricity.  It has been clearly stated that Ireland has the capacity, without having to use oil, to provide energy to Europe.  The interconnector is the main means of doing that.</P>
        <P>EirGrid is not doing its job in regard to dealing with the people.  EirGrid is our company, it is not a private company.  We own it and we do not want to see it in the courts for ten years but it is heading that way.  The issue will be fought at the next election and at the local elections next year.  Why has the Minister come back in regard to talks with the National Roads Authority?  The Minister should go for a drive out the M1 and look at them.  Something on that line would be acceptable to the people because this ground has been acquired.  It is away from property and people and away from devaluing their land.</P>
        <P>Meath, Monaghan and Cavan, like other counties, have tourism industries and the sight of pylons is not acceptable.  While I understand that a great deal of work is being done in the Department, this is a fantastic opportunity for Ireland as a nation to provide as much power as possible of its own.  We cannot continue to pay &euro;1.27 per litre for diesel.</P>
        <P>I have been in business previously.  I go home at weekends and I deal with people as part of one of my businesses.  They cannot survive for much longer given the energy costs.  One man <Col N="764"/>who had 35 people employed is now working by himself, due to the energy costs and the downturn in the building industry.  We have the technology and an educated workforce and Europe will grow.  We have got to be ready and energy is the key.  As an island nation everything has to be transported from this country through the use of oil or whatever.  The more we can produce here, the less oil we have to import for transporting to Europe.</P>
        <P>I am in contact with the group referred to earlier which is not a Mickey Mouse campaign.  This is not party political; everyone in every parish is united on this issue.  Each time I am in touch with the group on a different issue I am asked how this one is proceeding.  The group is as organised as the GAA, if not better.  Following one telephone call everybody knows that is going on.  Millions of euro has been collected to ensure that the company they own will not devalue their land or affect their health or the tourism industry.  The closing off of the relationship following the announcement of the study was a mistake because that is not what was agreed.  The group did appreciate the Minister taking it into his hands.</P>
        <P>In Duleek and Donore streets are being dug up resulting in businesses closing for six or eight weeks.  A notice to this effect appeared in a newspaper that the people do not buy.  Two years ago, when the State was flush with money, people had borrowed to the hilt and are still heavily indebted now that the State has no money.  They will not allow their businesses, the value of their land or the health of their children to be jeopardised.  While the World Health Organisation states the pylons will not affect human health, new WHO findings are due to be published.</P>
        <P>At midnight recently, Councillor Brian Fitzgerald and I visited an area with a number of electricity pylons.  I could not believe it when the fluorescent electricity tubes we brought with us lit up close to a pylon.  If one is using one&rsquo;s car kit while driving past the pylons located at Loganstown on the road to Dublin, one&rsquo;s mobile telephone will cut out.  Although there is clearly a problem, no one wants to address it.</P>
        <P>The people living in the affected area are prepared to compromise.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, must inform the people of County Meath of the outcome of his correspondence with the National Roads Authority.  What is the position regarding talks which were due to be held with the NRA on the possibility of installing the transmission lines along the route of the M3?  The new road will open soon.  If pylons were erected, the protestors at Tara would have other things to climb on to besides trees.  Pylon towers do not look so bad on the M1 but they cannot be erected in Moynalty, Nobber or Batterstown or on land on which farmers are supposed to produce good food.</P>
        <P>While I want the project to proceed, we must listen to the concerns about the current proposals.  Otherwise, the Minister&rsquo;s plans will be blocked and jobs will be lost.  All public representatives in the area, including Deputies Seymour Crawford, Damien English and Fianna F&aacute;il Party Members and councillors, share these concerns.  We are right, not the five, six or ten people who have decided to bulldoze through the current plan, which is not needed and will not be allowed to proceed.</P>
        <P>This is not a Mickey Mouse campaign.  Residents will stop at nothing to ensure their health, the land they use to produce food, property values and the tourism industry are protected.  The value of houses must not be allowed to decline by almost one third because the cheapest option is to erect stupid pylons across several counties.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to instruct EirGrid to examine the M3 and M1 options.  The pylon towers may not look so bad on the M1 but we will not allow them to be erected across our lands.  With a further 600 km of transmission lines required elsewhere, the Minister will have similar problems in every other county.  I ask him to engage in meaningful talks with representatives of North East Pylon Pressure before it is too late.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this welcome legislation.  Ensuring supply of safe, clean, sustainable energy at competitive prices is one of the greatest challenges facing Ireland.  Many Deputies from the north east spoke about the North-South interconnector.  I accept it is easy for me, as a Deputy from Waterford, to take a different view because my area will not be directly affected.</P>
        <P>Several months ago, I travelled to Germany with a parliamentary delegation, which included the Ceann Comhairle.  A number of members of the delegation with a particular interest in the North-South interconnector raised the issue with representatives of the federal and state governments.  We were told it is not possible to route the lines underground due to the high costs involved.  This approach has not been used elsewhere.  Nevertheless, there is merit in erecting overground power lines alongside a motorway as this would impact on fewer people.</P>
        <P>We need the North-South interconnector because the current infrastructure is not sufficient to meet our electricity needs.  We also need the east-west interconnector linking Ireland and Wales.  We must show flexibility regarding our source of electricity supply.  In Britain, it is estimated that 11 million of the country&rsquo;s 26 million consumers have changed supplier, while 8 million of 20 million gas consumers have changed theirs.  The comparative figure in the Republic is slightly more than 40,000, most of whom are probably on the commercial side.</P>
        <P>However, when one examines the telecommunications market here, it becomes clear that Irish people do not have difficulty changing to a company which will provide the cheapest service and best value for money.  Such a choice on the electricity sideis novel and not yet fully available but will, in due course, become as much a feature as the flexibility in the telecommunications side.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, the ESB has been the dominant force in the electricity market.  This is hardly surprising considering the company has been, to a large extent, the only supplier since the foundation of the State.  In the main, the company has served the nation well in its three quarters of a century of existence.  While there have been occasional flaws and deficiencies, in the main the quality of the service has been superb.</P>
        <P>I digress slightly to pay tribute to successive generations of workers in the ESB who have worked hard, often in the most atrocious conditions, to restore supply and given exemplary service when the chips were down.  It would be wrong of us, as we prepare for a major change in electricity supply and distribution, with more and more companies entering the electricity market, to forget this service to the fledgling State and the technical and financial difficulties which often had to be overcome.  I am drifting into history and we have a new Ireland and economy in which the energy sector must move with the times.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposals to facilitate the interconnection of electricity generated by systems not in the ownership of the ESB.  While this will make inroads into the company&rsquo;s dominant position, I have no doubt, given its vast experience and decades of tradition, that it will be able to take this new challenge in its stride and emerge a stronger, more competitive entity as a result.  This has been proven in other sectors and I have every confidence the ESB will be able to do the same.</P>
        <P>The development of the east-west interconnector is a key task in the 2008 work plan of the Commission for Energy Regulation.  This project would provide 500 MW of power.  We should be cognisant of the importance of renewable energy and the difficulties faced by many of those who wish to generate electricity from renewable sources and connect to the grid.  It is important they receive support.</P>
        <P>The first reaction of most people when faced with the question of how to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels is to look to motor vehicles for an alternative supply of energy.  While there is no doubt this sector offers considerable scope for savings, it is not the only area <Col N="766"/>which needs our attention.  Renewable sources of energy offer sustainable alternatives to our dependence on fossil fuels, a means of reducing harmful greenhouse emissions and opportunities to reduce our reliance on imported fuels.  For these reasons, Irish and European policies support the increased use of renewable energy from such sources as wind, solar power, wood, waste and water as they are abundantly available in Ireland.  Several renewable energy technologies are now economically viable and capable of supplying clean, economical heat and power.  The higher the price of oil, the more economically viable previously unviable sources will become.  The alternative energy industry must be further developed and positively encouraged through substantial investment and assistance to the industry.  The growing of rape seed and other crops should be actively promoted among a farming population which is finding itself increasingly isolated, with reduced incomes and disused or underused land.  That is not a natural condition for good farmers and I am sure they would welcome any positive measure which would bring them back into productive and useful farming again.</P>
        <P>The time is right for more initiatives in the alternative energy field.  The public is thinking of ways to reduce energy costs and those who are so minded &mdash; that is a growing number &mdash; are looking at ways to help the environment and meet our requirements in the reduction of harmful emissions.  A constituent of mine who has a stream running through his land has set up a company to develop a hydroelectric scheme with a view to selling his power into the national grid.  I spoke about this in the Seanad and said it was not pie in the sky, and I was correct because it is up and running.  I heard a man speak on local radio while I was travelling up here on Tuesday and he can generate enough electricity for 800 or 900 houses.  One should think of the difference it could make to us if a number of people were to do something similar.  He did this without any financial aid or assistance and said it would take approximately 15 years before he would eventually get a payback on it.  He was not doing it for financial reasons but for the best environmental reasons.  We must encourage more of that.  It can be replicated on a large scale but the ground must be properly prepared for such developments.</P>
        <P>I get very annoyed with people who use blanket arguments against wind power.  Whether their point is that such turbines are noisy or that the towers impinge on the landscape, we must face up to the fact that we have to find an alternative to oil, and the wind method is especially suited to this country.  It will take a large investment and may mean heavy subvention by the Government, but unless we promote these cleaner forms of energy we will leave the door open to those pushing the nuclear option.</P>
        <P>There will be some drawback with every means of generating electricity.  When the first hydroelectric station was set up at Ardnacrusha three quarters of a century ago, the landscape had to be changed radically to allow for the new route of the headrace and tailrace to accommodate the assisted flow of water.  When Turlough Hill was suggested and constructed over 30 years ago many environmentalists condemned the interference with the mountain and countryside.  That pumped storage station soon became a showpiece and, while small enough by today&rsquo;s standards, it still represents go-ahead thinking in the power and energy industry.  I realise that wind energy is not perfect, but it is way ahead of other forms of electricity generation.  It is held that Ireland has the most abundant and reliable supply of wind in Europe and it is bordering on sinful that we are not using it to the fullest effect.  We cannot suggest that wind turbines are silent and there is a perception that wind farms are noisy developments.  That is not necessarily true or accurate.  As technology improves, the disadvantages and misgivings will reduce and in time we will come to look on wind energy as our saviour.</P>
        <P>We are also best placed in Europe to take advantage of wave power, the returns for which are enormous.  The technical people will be readily able to tell us just how many megawatts can be generated by a single wave, but I know from reading and from TV programmes that <Col N="767"/>wave power has much to offer our country.  It would be easy to despair and get downhearted about the future of oil.  I have every confidence the motor industry will come up with an alternative fuel for vehicles and we have clean and bountiful natural resources on our side to tackle domestic and industrial requirements.</P>
        <P>I began to mention CER&rsquo;s plans to develop this interconnector, which are well advanced and form a key part of CER&rsquo;s strategy for the further development of the Irish electricity sector.  CER has worked with EirGrid to advance this project and it will remain a key priority during 2008.  It will have a capacity of 500 MW and it is hoped that it will be delivered by the end of 2011.  The advantages of increasing levels of interconnection for an island system such as Ireland&rsquo;s are clear.  Not alone will interconnection with the UK increase security of supply, but it will also help to drive competition and improve overall efficiency in the Irish electricity system.  This is bound to benefit all of us.  It will significantly reduce Ireland&rsquo;s isolation from other European markets and will introduce new competitively priced electricity into the system.  This will put downward pressure on prices meaning they will be lower than would otherwise be possible.</P>
        <P>While technically the supply can flow either way, depending on who has the excess at any given time, the most likely scenario is that we will be the recipients of electricity from the UK.  This opens up a whole new debate on nuclear generated electricity because we will be taking our supply from a grid which is in turn supplied from nuclear sources.  We are a nuclear free country and, with an occasional exception, everybody wants to keep it that way.  It is bad enough to have Sellafield on our doorstep and other nuclear stations on the British east coast to threaten our well-being without generating the same threats in our own country over which we have full jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>I have some reservations about this matter and it is one of the reasons I have consistently pushed to make ourselves as self-sufficient as possible in energy supply.  I repeat what I said several times before, we must put more resources into researching the generation of electricity from other renewable and sustainable sources.  The major problem is encouraging independent generation and getting that power into the grid, as I mentioned.  We are daily told about the imminent peaking of oil availability, the high demand which will come from the greatly expanding economies of China, India and other eastern countries and the instability and insecurity in the supply of gas from eastern Europe.  A couple of years ago we saw how gas was shut off from the Russian Federation&rsquo;s neighbours and, while there does not appear to be any threat at the moment to those who can pay for their supply, we do not know what will come down the tracks in a decade or two.</P>
        <P>Now is the time to provide for the hard times.  Now is the time to encourage home-produced energy and to do what we must to guarantee easy access to the grid for those who enter the market and take the insecurity out of the equation for them.  We should be mature enough to realise that people do not invest vast sums in any enterprise without some reasonable expectation of success and while obstacles exist which can easily be removed.  The ESB is doing a good job.  It has served us well, but this is 2008 and we have massive energy needs, not 1958 when demand was easily satisfied.  We must move on and change.  This legislation is another step along that way and I commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the chance to say a few words on this Bill.  Although the Bill is fairly short, the Minister&rsquo;s speech introduced a few different areas into the debate so that gives us all the chance to talk about interconnectors in different counties throughout the country.  It is a useful Bill which we all support.  Giving EirGrid more powers and letting it go and do its job is probably correct and it is a wonder we are doing it only now.  I am sorry the other Bill relating to EirGrid is not coming through to give it the powers and <Col N="768"/>assets, and break up the ESB once and for all.  There are difficulties with ESB staff, which I hope can be sorted out shortly.  Until now EirGrid was mainly involved in planning, researching and getting organised.  Now it has to spend real money and deliver projects.  Some ambitious targets have been set for these interconnectors and the Minister said he hopes that by 2012 the east-west interconnector will be built.  He also claimed the same date for the North-South interconnector.  If the current approach continues, I wish him luck.  It has not been handled in the best way and there are many concerns.  I believe the east-west interconnector can be built on time &mdash; by 2011 or 2012, or before that if they really want to do it.  It is going underground.  Any sensible person will accept this and there will probably be few objections.  We have been discussing and planning this for ten years and the case for the interconnector was proven long ago.  It is needed and it will happen on time.  Some of the private companies are now claiming they could build their own interconnectors more quickly.  It is a pity they did not get involved in the project earlier.  I understand the project was put out to tender before now and nobody was interested until the Government decided to do it itself.  It is interesting how things move along.  It is to be hoped it will happen on time.</P>
        <P>I fully support the east-west line as planned and the route it is taking even though it goes through my county.  We need it and it is sensible to put it underground.  I must accept this as it is the way it is &mdash; we will have concerns going along but it is to be hoped we will be able to iron them out.</P>
        <P>EirGrid&rsquo;s job of managing the distribution network is an interesting but tough job.  I have been in the control centre and seen what they do there.  It is a place where an awful lot can happen at the touch of a button.  IT is used, as well as competent staff, to control everything.  I did not realise they could literally tap into every windmill farm and turn it off or on when they want to.  It is an interesting place and I urge all Deputies to avail of the opportunity to see how it works so that they may understand its importance.  Many of the speeches last week and this week on this issue dealt with energy supply, security and cost.  It is a major issue and we need to understand it.</P>
        <P>Apart from the fact that I represent County Meath, where the proposed route is, I am also interested in this project from the point of view of small businesses.  Those who are running small businesses have made it clear to us that energy costs are a big issue and they want it tackled.  There have been some positive moves over the past couple of years to help reduce some of the costs, but there is a long way to go to make things easier for business and ease the pressure.  I am not advocating that we spend five times or ten times the money putting in different infrastructure than was suggested; that is not the argument.  We should simply spend the money wisely and ensure we get the best value.</P>
        <P>One of the reasons for building interconnectors, which is one of the main tasks of EirGrid, is that it will give us an opportunity to sell our energy as well as take it in.  At the moment we are a net importer and we will be for a while, but it is to be hoped that at some point we will be able to sell the energy we produce and make money.  My colleagues have spoken about the possibility of Ireland being a green energy supplier, and that would be great.  It would be nice to be known for that.  We are known to be a green country, with the shamrock and so on.  We should set this as a target and go after it.</P>
        <P>The most important short-term issue is security of energy supply.  People have been saying over the past few years that we will run out of energy.  At Christmas 2006 it was predicted there would be blackouts.  This has not happened and I do not believe it will.  My reading of the figures is that we are all right for the next couple of years.  We need to get ourselves ready for what will happen down the line but it is not as urgent as people are making out.  Our electricity will not go next Easter or next Christmas.  We are all right from that point of view. <Col N="769"/> However, one never knows.  I understand that part of EirGrid&rsquo;s job is to consider, along with the Department, the area of energy production.  At the moment we are centred on gas but we are moving towards wind and other energy resources.  We will also lose out on some energy resources, such as turf, with the current cutbacks in turf cutting.  We must consider other supplies.</P>
        <P>Many Oireachtas committees have been travelling to different countries over the past number of years to look at supply methods and different ways of doing business.  My committee, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, went to Gussing, Austria, at the suggestion of Deputy Mary White.  It is an interesting place.  The Minister is probably well aware of the projects being carried out in Gussing, but when I spoke to other people they did not know about it.  We should consider places such as this.  Gussing, a population centre of less than 5,000 which was one of the poorest areas of Austria in the early 1990s, has turned itself around to become one of the most self-sustaining and profitable areas in the country.  This was mostly done by investment in energy production, although it also tapped into many grants from Europe.  We visited plants that extract energy from biomass and biogas plants that make gas from grass, corn and so on.  They call the plant a &ldquo;cow&rdquo; because it eats the same things as a cow and produces gas.  This gas is then used to produce electricity.  The area also has district heating, which is not something we have in Ireland but which I have seen in other countries.  It works quite well.  I accept it would probably not be cost-effective to install it in existing developments, but in the future, for developments of 200 or 300 houses, we should consider a system of district or central heating.  I have asked EirGrid directly to consider this and I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the Department considers it also.</P>
        <P>In Gussing, much effort is put into using local resources to obtain energy which can be sold to the national grid to offset the cost of its own power use.  More than 50 businesses have chosen to locate there over the past seven or eight years, purely because of the low cost of energy.  That is something we must learn from.  Sometimes in Ireland we have too much of a tendency to think big.  We plan huge power plants that will produce half the country&rsquo;s supply.  However, we also need to consider the smaller versions.  We already have wind farms, which is a step in the right direction, but even with them we are thinking big.  It is only recently we have been hearing talk of smaller one-off windmills attached to people&rsquo;s homes.  We must consider the possibility of villages and towns having their own plans for the provision of heat and energy in their area using the materials around them.  In Monaghan or Navan, for example, where furniture is made, we could use wood left over from furniture building.  There are certain things we can do if we put our minds to it.  We need to consider energy production in smaller areas in conjunction with county councils, enterprise boards, and people involved in rural areas, such as partnership groups.</P>
        <P>Obtaining permission to sell the resulting power is a complicated process and there is no guarantee.  We should consider giving guarantees to community-centred, not-for-profit or county council groups wishing to provide their own energy supply that they will have an opportunity to supply the grid.  They should not be treated in the same way as a private consortium.  Common sense must be encouraged, and we must encourage a supply of energy at cost price, rather than at a profit.  Many big companies are involved in providing infrastructure in Ireland, be it roads, electricity or something else, and they are there to make profits.  We do encourage enterprise but we should also encourage not-for-profit enterprises.  This is working well in the area of child care and community projects and we should consider it for other areas.  People are under immense pressure when it comes to the cost of living, and the cost of running a business is also increasing.  Anything we can do to use new ideas to save costs should be tried.  We must learn from other countries.</P><Col N="770"/>
        <P>We have a terrible habit in Ireland of conducting endless pilot schemes and studies.  I do not know whether this is done just to delay spending money.  Every now and then we should just do something.  If we get it wrong it does not matter &mdash; we can do something else.  We are obsessed in every area of Government with studies and comparisons.  I want to see more politicians and Ministers making decisions and doing things.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is often criticised for going headlong after something and not thinking it through, but at least he is trying to reform things.  Other Ministers are the same; Deputy Ryan is another Minister who will try to reform things.  Politicians need to have guts.  It is not all about setting up State agencies or bodies or other groups to take away decision-making.  Decisions can be made by Government; that is where the quickest decisions can be made.  I encourage this, especially in the area of energy delivery, production and cost.  Let us make some quick decisions and try to get there as we go along.  We must set targets that are interesting and challenging rather than establishing the bare EU minimum.  Let us go after high targets in this area.</P>
        <P>This Bill streamlines the delivery of energy through EirGrid.  It will be working on these projects for a couple of years but in the future I hope it will be more proactive.  I wish to mention interconnectors as the Minister himself brought it up.  However, I will first mention smart meters.  The energy regulator spoke to our committee recently and explained to us that it would take four or five years to roll out smart meters and that the cost would be high.  Four or five years is probably not a bad target when we consider that a year ago we thought we would never see this.  However, I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister to consider giving priority to those who want to produce electricity in their own areas.  They have to be given the chance to obtain smart meters and other incentives more quickly than anybody else because they are making an effort.  The smart meters will be rolled out in yet another pilot scheme.  I do not know why.  We do not need pilot schemes.  We know it is the right thing to do.  The Minister brought the idea further when he took over the office.  We should not bother with pilot schemes but start rolling out the project as quickly as we can.  We should ensure that those who want to make their own energy are given priority.</P>

	<P>That should be enough to cover the problems of my county.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have stated that I fully accept the interconnector that is going underground.  I accept the necessity for the North-South one and everybody involved in the campaign to have the proposal changed from overground to underground fully accepts the necessity for this.  We in the north east also want more businesses and more jobs created and we want to be able to run our own factories etc.  There is no doubt about that and we will do our bit for the country by carrying the supply through the counties.  The issue is not that, but how we go about our business.</P>
        <P>In that regard, there is a couple of issues I want to tackle.  First, seeing as today is about EirGrid and its role in the future, we really must look at how EirGrid does its job of dealing with people and how it makes decisions because the company got it wrong in this instance.  I accept EirGrid was given permission by a previous Minister to put these overground, no questions asked.  I also accept that since then this Minister, Deputy Ryan, has stated that first let us do a study to check out all of this.  That is the way it should have been done in the first place.  They should have undertaken this study first.</P>
        <P>Everyone speaks of best international practice and we compare figures and charts.  Those opposed have different figures to those who are in favour, but I would like to see an analysis of best practice from the past couple of years, not dating back over the past 30 years, of what other countries have decided to do because the majority of infrastructure for carrying electricity <Col N="771"/>was built years ago and would not necessarily adhere to today&rsquo;s best practice.  Many private companies are producing and using the DC line, which seems to work quite well and seems close to the usefulness of an AC line, and yet EirGrid states it cannot be used.  Other Government representatives, including the next Taoiseach, told us to forget about it, that it was not even worth discussing.  When it involves people&rsquo;s health, it is worth discussing and checking out to see whether it is an option.  One should not rule it out.</P>
        <P>EirGrid, before an Oireachtas committee, ruled out the use of the M3.  They did not even consider it.  That is not right.  That is not treating people properly or giving every chance of a fair say.  They ruled out going underground and, as I said, did not even check it out.  They ruled out engaging properly with the people.</P>
        <P>They decided to come down and tell the people that it was not possible to go underground and that it would cost ten times the amount.  Those were mistruths &mdash; I cannot use the word &ldquo;lies&rdquo; here.  They were wrong to state that they could not go underground.  They were wrong to state that it would cost ten times the amount when they did not know what it would cost.  We might accept that AC might cost more, but none of us here knows.  It could cost two times, five times, 10 times or 20 times the amount.</P>
        <P>It is wrong for a State body to arrive down to a community and give information that is wrong to mislead and to discourage a certain method.  Despite giving EirGrid more powers, we should give it proper direction on how to conduct its business, how to do proper research, how to deal with people and how to conduct proper public relations.  I accept that EirGrid will state that it has learned from this and, with some humility, it has accepted that it got certain matters wrong, but it is still adamant it will opt for the same use of infrastructure.  We must look at all of that.</P>
        <P>Returning to the reasons people have a difficulty with these pylons and the infrastructure running over them, there are many reports, probably hundreds in the past couple of years but many more than that over the past ten to 30 years, some of which raise doubts over magnetic fields.  Many do not, but there is a doubt and where there is a doubt, Government, State bodies and all the rest have a duty of care to the people and to their families to check all of this out.  There are other arguments about the environment, esthetics and the value of family homes and of land, but they all are separate to the real argument based on health.  Those other matters should be looked at, but health is the most important matter and we must thoroughly check it out before we engage on a policy of putting in any more lines.</P>
        <P>Apart from the health issue, there could be savings to be made as well.  It might be cheaper to go underground using different technology and I want that fully checked out.  I do not accept the figures we have been given by EirGrid for the cost of going overground.  They are not realistic.  They do not include the full cost of the hassle involved in the years of legal and planning challenges and delays.  All of those costs must be factored in and we must look at the real cost of going underground.  If it is at all possible to go underground, for health reasons if it is the same cost we should definitely go underground and even if it costs a little more we should consider it.  It might prove less expensive than going overground.  That needs to be fully checked out.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy McManus and other Deputies who stated we should come in here to debate the matter, and we should debate it at Committee as well.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, is open to that because he has been very open about this in the past couple of months.  In his speech, he mentioned that he hoped and believed EirGrid will have a big influence on that study and will have a big say in the deliberations.  I am sorry he did not state in the same speech that he expects the community to have the same say, and that he will give them the same chances.  As EirGrid is on one side of this debate and the people are on the other, both should <Col N="772"/>be given an equal opportunity to have their views heard and concerns addressed by the consultants conducting the study.  Both should be brought in and listened to, and given a fair chance to put their case, because both have an argument to make.  It is wrong to give one side more than the other.</P>
        <P>As I stated, I will not say the health argument is true or false.  There is evidence and doubts, and we must check them out fully.  No loss of life is acceptable, despite a guy who claimed to work for EirGrid stating on local radio that it was okay in Italy for four or five children to die over 30 or 40 years.  That is not okay and is not acceptable.  One cannot put a cost on that.  No politician worth his or her salt, irrespective of party, could ever accept that.</P>
        <P>There are people in the north east who are doing a great deal of work on this.  They have made a 300 page submission to this study to have this investigated.  They are doing their job right.  They are not necessarily scaremongering, they are just talking about the issues.  However, they are going around trying to raise hundreds of thousands to fight this legally because they have been led up the garden path by certain people and politicians that this can be stopped in the planning process or in the High Court.  In my view, that cannot happen unless we change the direction given to EirGrid and unless the Government changes the regulations on the use of lines overground.  No barrister or solicitor would be able to defeat planning laws.  If Ministers and politicians who claim to be against it are against it, the best, quickest and most effective way for this to be done is to bring new regulations to this House stating that in future all lines will go underground.  I, for one, accept that one cannot go back to do something with existing lines but we can for those of the future in a cost effective manner.  The Minister needs to tell the people that this is about political decisions of Government, not about raising millions to fight legal cases.  People in these areas cannot afford to spend millions and yet they feel they must because they are being convinced that it is not just a matter of politics.  It is a matter of politics.  This House makes decisions on how this country is run.  This House makes decisions on how taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent.  Taxpayers&rsquo; money will be spent to build this infrastructure and therefore the decision lies in here.  The study is a useful step in the right direction to assess the situation and give us the information we need to have a proper and balanced debate, but if the figures add up and if the information is true, I would expect the Minister to make that decision and direct EirGrid to go underground with this and other lines in the future.  It is not about Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, it is about the future of the country and how we decide to spend our money and do our business, protecting everybody and delivering energy at the right price.  Nobody is asking for extremes, just a fair crack of the whip.  Let us not have people spending money unnecessarily when it is down to decisions made here.</P>
        <P>I ask the consultants to explain in their report why some countries have decided to apply directives and regulations on the distance of such lines from homes.  EirGrid technically must install lines 25 m from homes and will try to have them at 50 m.  Personally, I encourage them to be at least 150 m from homes.  Why have other countries set targets of 200 m and 250 m?  Somebody has obviously convinced them that it is right to do so.  We need to access that information and find out why that choice was made so that at least we can have a proper debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the latitude.  It was not all technically to do with the Bill but the Minister gave us the opportunity by going that road himself.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like previous speakers, I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a contribution on this important Bill.  It may not involve a large number of sections but, nonetheless, it is very important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important on occasions like this to recognise the contribution the ESB has made to this country.  It has been one of our most successful State companies and I am always proud to <Col N="773"/>remind people that it was the first Government of this country that put it in place in 1927 after the success of Ardnacrusha.  The Government had the vision to put the ESB in place at the time and it was criticised for doing so.  It has been one of the most successful State bodies in this country, and comparatively one of the best of any country.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">At that time the ESB was set up to manage the power generated at Ardnacrusha.  That station now generates less than 2% of our gross output, so that gives an example of how our energy network has developed since 1927.  EirGrid was established in 2006 and is a new State-owned company.  It is separate from all parties in the Irish electricity sector and it took over responsibility for the operation of the Irish national grid.  It has its own separate board and it reports to the CER and its main shareholder, the Government.  It was established as the operator of the Irish transmission system, but ownership remains with the ESB.  On 12 March last year, the Government policy on energy stated that ownership of the transmission would be vested in EirGrid from the end of 2008.  EirGrid is responsible for balancing electricity consumption and generation and for the development of the power system.</P>
        <P>In October 2006, the decision to proceed with the development of a 500 MW electricity interconnector with the UK and to give ownership of the asset to EirGrid  was announced.  The delivery of the interconnector is a key priority in the energy White Paper and in the programme for Government.  This Bill simply provides the statutory basis for EirGrid to carry out the functions associated with building and operating such an interconnector.  The main provisions of the Bill will be to expand the functions of EirGrid to include the construction and ownership of an interconnector and the operation of an interconnector, subject to the appropriate authorisation by the CER.  Another provision is to amend the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to clarify the position of interconnectors not owned by the ESB, and to make it an offence to operate an interconnector without the appropriate authorisation from the CER.The Bill also provides for the establishment of subsidiaries by EirGrid, the increase of its statutory borrowing limit, allows for capital expenditure by EirGrid and other ancillary matters.</P>
        <P>Interconnection is crucial to the security, price competitiveness and environmental sustainability of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply.  First, in the event of a shortage in electricity supply in Ireland for any reason, connection with other grids increases the chances that our supply will not be inadequate.  Second, greater interconnection in effect makes Ireland a part of a larger electricity market, with many more competing generators and increasing economies of scale, thus leading to lower prices.  Finally, greater interconnection is crucial for the development of renewable energy.  Many renewable energy sources, such as wind and wave energy, are intermittent and can only work if there are backup sources of electricity.  Interconnection provides a greater bank of such backup sources, thus enabling us to increase the proportion of our energy that comes from wind.  Furthermore, greater interconnection across Europe generally dramatically increases the potential for wind energy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, the pace of the interconnection programme to date can be criticised to some extent.  Many other European countries, including those isolated by the sea, have much greater interconnection with their neighbours than we do.  They are pushing ahead with even more ambitious plans.  For example, Norway currently has 2,800 MW of interconnection with Sweden, 1,000 MW with Denmark, 100 MW with Finland and 50 MW with Russia.  A 580 km interconnector between Norway and the Netherlands that will generate 700 MW is currently under construction, while another sub-sea cable to the UK is at the planning stage.  Deputy Coveney pointed out that Denmark has interconnection with Sweden, from both the western mainland and the eastern islands, amounting to a total of 2,800 MW, as well as substantial connection between its various islands.</P><Col N="774"/>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s interconnection is in a very poor state by comparison.  The total currently amounts to 480 MW with Northern Ireland, and that is no longer properly classed as interconnection since the establishment of the all-Ireland electricity market.  In spite of this, interconnection projects are proceeding very slowly.  That is why I welcome this Bill and hope it proceeds rapidly.  Fine Gael will not be doing anything to delay its passage.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that EirGrid will develop a 500 MW interconnector between Great Britain and Ireland in the next four years.  With the demand for energy estimated to grow at an average yearly rate of between 2.7% and 3.6% over the next seven years, the planned east-west interconnector will contribute to securing energy supply in Ireland.  The interconnector will hopefully increase competition and facilitate growth in renewable energy in Ireland.  The Ireland to Wales undersea electricity link being developed by EirGrid will be capable of carrying power to supply the equivalent of approximately 350,000 homes.  The interconnector will link two separate power transmission systems, which will enable two-way transmission of high voltage electricity.  The interconnector will carry electricity for all parties in the electricity market, such as the ESB, Airtricity, SWS, Tynagh, Viridian and others.  EirGrid does not generate or sell electricity and so is totally independent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was a member of Kerry County Council some years ago when there was a major discussion on wind energy.  Enterprising people in Kerry like Mike Barry saw the potential in wind generation.  We proposed that we would draw up a special wind policy for the county and would designate certain areas as being suitable for turbines.  As a result, the Stacks Mountains have come to resemble an energy park.  There are turbines right across those mountains and although people had initial reservations on how these turbines might affect them or the skyline, they have grown to live with them and the turbines are quite aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  The Stacks Mountains generate more wind energy than the rest of the country put together.  There is further capacity there and more wind farms will be coming on stream.</P>
        <P>Planning permission was granted to provide 4,000 MW of electricity, but because we cannot utilise this capacity whenever the demand is not there, that is why the interconnector will be important.  Our turbines can generate electricity all of the time, which will make wind energy far more viable as an alternative source in Ireland.  I hope that this will provide further impetus to the wind energy industry here, as it has really taken off in County Kerry.</P>
        <P>I will now turn to the power station in Tarbert.  The ESB decided to sell off some of its power stations, including Great Island, Tarbert, Poolbeg Thermal and the Marina Steam Turbine.  The ESB decided in June 2007 that these stations would be closed by 2010.  This was greeted with many reservations in Tarbert.  People were shocked.  There are 130 jobs in Tarbert where there are no real alternative sources of employment and it was a shock to the community.  The ESB has been synonymous with Tarbert since 1969 when the foundations for the current generating station were laid.</P>
        <P>The ESB has now advertised these plants and has sought formal expressions of interest in respect of their assets.  In October 2007, it invited bids for Tarbert and Great Island.  I am enthused by the reaction I understand it received.  Hopefully, the plant will be bought and will continue in operation as a power generating plant.  Apparently, setting up a plant now costs about &euro;300 million and &euro;150 million of the infrastructure is already there if people want to change from oil at that location.  As we heard from previous speakers from County Meath and elsewhere, putting pylons and wire over ground leads to much controversy.  The wires are already in place here so why would one enter into all that controversy when one has the infrastructure in place as it is?  It is critically important that the ESB offloads this to somebody who will continue to operate it.</P><Col N="775"/>
        <P Just="Left">A major proposal for a liquid natural gas plant on the Shannon estuary has gone through An Bord Plean&aacute;la and is on track.  An application for a pipeline must now be made.  That focuses people&rsquo;s minds and interest in the very unique land bank in public ownership in the Tarbert-Ballylongford area that is known as the Tarbert-Ballylongford land bank.  IDA Ireland and Shannon Development should designate that land bank as an energy park.  There are 1,000 acres there between land in public ownership and land owned by companies.  It could be called the national energy park in the same way as the facility in Limerick has been designated as the national electronics centre.  There is a mix of coal and oil generation just across the river and there will now be gas on site.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are turbines in the locality so there is a mix and balance of energies there.  I am sure that as someone who thinks creatively, the Minister of State will agree to considering this move.  It provides IDA Ireland and Shannon Development with an opportunity to do something very creative with the site.  It provides them with an opportunity not just to provide a holding operation for liquid natural, but to provide for other alternatives as well, both for supply and production.  I see no reason that companies could not move into that area to generate alternative forms of energy.</P>
        <P>I visited Silicon Valley recently, which should really be referred to as Innovation Valley because most of the innovations in the world come from there.  That is the way their universities are set up for innovation.  Everybody out there is thinking about innovation.  The visit was an eye opener.  It is no coincidence that the microchip and most of the other developments in recent times have come from there.</P>
        <P>They are looking at applying their technology to green technology.  I visited one plant where solar energy panels are being used.  Their total electricity was being generated and water for the house was being heated.  In Ireland, we are just heating water with solar panels.  I have been involved in a few projects relating to heating water, such a swimming pool and our own dressing rooms at home, which have been very successful.  However, this particular company, Akeena, is generating electricity for 2,000 homes with its panel.  It is not unlike the panels we are using here but it can do more than just heat water.  I contacted another company, NovaSolar, which operates in San Jos&eacute; and is very interested in looking at Ireland and seeing what we are doing here.</P>
        <P>A few weeks after that, the Governor of California made a major announcement with that company of something like $300 million in investment into future green energy alternatives.  As a country, we could be the leaders on wind, wave and tidal energy if we just pursue it.  Generally speaking, Irish people are very creative.  I know measures have been taken but there is so much more scope there and we must take this area very seriously.</P>
        <P>In respect of the LNG plant on the Shannon estuary, there was strong local support because that land has been lying idle for 30 years or more.  Some of it was bought back in the 1960s.  However, there were also reservations.  Obviously, it will affect some local people&rsquo;s quality of life.  I know that Shannon LNG is speaking to local development companies.  I would advise it to continue its dialogue with just the local people and accommodate their wishes and needs in any way possible.  These people are very reasonable, but also very concerned.  I say that here today because it gives us so much opportunity going forward in that area not just in respect of providing facilities and terminals for liquid natural gas, but also providing for associated industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have become very uncompetitive in respect of attracting industry to Ireland.  During my visit to Silicon Valley, one of IDA Ireland's officials there pointed out to me that we have considerable competition from India, China, Malaysia and other countries but that the total cost of employing a person in Silicon Valley is $26 per head.  The figure is &euro;28 in Ireland and <Col N="776"/>&euro;6 in Poland.  Our energy costs are becoming a major disadvantage when we try to promote Ireland.  The biggest advantages we have at present are the 12.5% corporation tax rate and our very well-educated and creative workforce.  They are our two big advantages but we are not competing in respect of labour and energy costs.  Hopefully, this Bill will not only fuel wind energy generation in this country but might make our energy costs more competitive at some point down the road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The support of Members of this House for the provisions of the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Bill in respect of electricity interconnection is very welcome.  I have listened with interest to the Deputies&rsquo; points about security of supply, costs and competitiveness and our ambitious renewable targets.</P>
        <P>The east-west electricity interconnector is a key strategic infrastructural project.  With EirGrid as owner, we can be certain that it will contribute significantly to maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s security of supply.  It will also be made available to all users on a non-discriminatory basis and will support the development of renewable wind generation.</P>
        <P>In the context of liberalised multi-player energy markets, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has responsibility for ensuring security of electricity and gas supplies.  The CER plays a key role in overseeing the development of the east-west interconnector and in its ongoing regulation.  I assure the Deputies that the Department, together with CER and EirGrid, is working to ensure that this project is delivered in the most expeditious manner and at the lowest possible cost to consumers.</P>
        <P>EirGrid is a fully independent, transmission system operator, licensed by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  As several Deputies highlighted, EirGrid plays a key strategic role in the independent operation of the single electricity market in co-operation with its Northern Ireland counterpart.  EirGrid also has responsibility for monitoring and reporting on security of electricity supply and generation adequacy.  It is instrumental in facilitating the increased penetration of the renewable generation in the Irish electricity system.</P>
        <P>The Bill, which expands EirGrid&rsquo;s statutory functions, clearly demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s confidence in EirGrid&rsquo;s ability to deliver on its challenging mandate.  I am aware that the Minister will be happy to consider carefully any proposed amendments to this Bill from all parties in this House as long as they serve to expedite the planning and development of our electricity interconnection and, in so doing, help deliver important benefits for Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have also listened to the concerns raised by Deputies on all sides about overhead electricity lines and certain transmission projects currently being developed by EirGrid.  The Deputies will be aware that international consultants have been appointed by the Department to undertake an independent study to provide the best available professional advice on the relative merits of constructing and operating overhead transmission lines compared to underground cables.  This study will have regard to technical characteristics, reliability, operation and maintenance factors, environmental impact, possible health issues and cost factors.  The study will address the concerns raised by the Deputies on this issue.</P>
        <P>The Department also requested submissions from the public on this issue, which generated a huge response.  The consultants will consider the more than 500 public submissions received.  The consultants will also be available to meet the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to discuss the details of the report once published.</P>
        <P>Turning again to the Bill, it is one of a range of ambitious and challenging measures that will help to advance the Government&rsquo;s energy agenda, as outlined in the energy policy frame<Col N="777"/>work and programme for Government.  The Government is providing strong leadership in this area and will deliver a sustainable, secure, efficient and competitive all-Ireland energy market.  Our overall objective is to develop an economy and society that value both energy and the environment.</P>
        <P>The Minister is anxious that this Bill be considered as soon as possible on Committee Stage with the aim of progressing it to the Statute Book as quickly as possible.  In this regard, the Minister wishes to encourage Deputies to table any amendments to the Bill as quickly as possible so that they can be given full and fair consideration.  Such amendments will be considered on their merit with an open mind.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to bring before the House the Chemicals Bill 2008.  Its main purpose is to facilitate the enforcement of certain EU regulations concerning chemicals.  These EU regulations include the REACH regulation &mdash; REACH is the acronym for the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals; the regulation concerning the export and import of certain dangerous chemicals under the Rotterdam convention; and the detergents regulation.  The Bill also provides the means for giving effect to EU directives concerning the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances.  The Bill does not apply to human or veterinary medicines or to food flavourings or feedstuffs which will continue to be regulated under existing legislation.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the three EU regulations, with which this Bill is concerned, are directly applicable in Ireland.  That means their provisions must be complied with and cannot be changed by any implementing legislation.  Therefore, the provisions of the Bill relate only to measures necessary for enforcement.</P>
        <P>Chemicals are critical to the way we live today.  They form part of virtually everything we make and use, and provide enormous benefits to society.  Some chemicals, however, can present risks to human health and to the environment.  They may cause damage if, for example, they are toxic or carcinogenic or they may give rise to major accidents if not properly controlled.  For that reason, it is important to have systems in place to identify, monitor and control chemicals and their effects while continuing to ensure that they are available for the benefit of society.</P>
        <P>I will first summarise the background and context of the Bill.  I will then briefly outline the approach taken in framing the Bill and I will describe the purpose and reasoning behind each section.<b>  </b>The best known of the EU regulations being given further effect to by this Bill is the EU REACH regulation.  The REACH regulation entered into force on 1 July 2007, giving a legal basis to the new European Chemicals Agency.  Most of the provisions of the REACH regulation will enter into force on 1 June this year, and the timely enactment of this Bill will ensure that the necessary enforcement measures are in place.</P>
        <P>Under REACH, the burden of proof lies with industry.  All manufacturers and importers of chemicals must identify and manage risks linked to the chemicals they manufacture and market.  For chemicals produced or imported in quantities of 1 tonne or more per year per enterprise, manufacturers and importers need to demonstrate that they have done so by means of registering the chemicals with the European Chemicals Agency.  It is estimated that about 30,000 chemicals currently in use will have to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency.  The full registration will take place over a period of ten years from now, starting with chemicals of greatest risk and finishing with those with the least risk.  However, all of these chemicals will be subject to pre-registration at the European Chemicals Agency over a six-month period which starts on 1 June this year.  This means that all manufacturers and importers of chemicals will have to pre-register chemicals by 1 December 2008.  The European Chemicals Agency is expecting 130,000 pre-registrations.  The agency may then check that each chemical complies with the regulation and must evaluate testing proposals submitted by the registrant to ensure that the assessment of the chemical substances will not result in unnecessary testing, especially on animals.</P>
        <P>REACH also provides for an authorisation system aimed at ensuring that substances of very high concern are properly controlled and progressively replaced by suitable alternative <Col N="779"/>substances or technologies where these are economically and technically viable.  Where this is not possible, the use of substances may only be authorised where there is an overall benefit to society from such use.  In addition, REACH provides for the imposition of restrictions on the manufacture, use or placing on the market of substances causing an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment.  This is a feature of existing EU legislation.  REACH is probably the most ambitious chemicals legislation in the world.  It should enable us to significantly increase our knowledge of the use of chemicals and on using them safely.</P>
        <P>The EU regulation on the export and import of dangerous chemical implements in the EU is the Rotterdam Convention on prior informed consent.  A dangerous chemical that is listed in the annexes of the EU regulation may only be exported with the prior consent of the importer in the importing country.  In addition to provisions relating to chemicals listed in the annexes, the regulation also contains provisions that apply to all chemicals when exported.  These provisions address, in particular, requirements on packaging and labelling as specified by respective Community legislation.  The objective of the procedure under the regulation is to protect human health and the environment from potential harm and to contribute to the environmentally sound use of chemicals.</P>
        <P>The detergents regulation entered into force on 8 October 2005, replacing five directives concerning the biodegradability of surfactants, which are chemicals used in detergents and which can have adverse effects on the environment.  The scope of the regulation is to harmonise rules relating to the biodegradability of surfactants in detergents, restrictions or bans on surfactants on grounds of biodegradability and additional labelling of detergents, including fragrance allergens and information that manufacturers must hold at the disposal of the member states&rsquo; competent authorities and medical personnel.  The key aims of the regulation are to safeguard the Single Market in these products and to ensure a high level of environmental protection.</P>
        <P>The approach in framing the Chemicals Bill was to provide a clear regulatory framework for business that would result in high levels of compliance and increased co-operation between the various national authorities to maximise efficiencies in enforcement.  The draft heads of the Bill were the subject of public consultation in October and November last year and a regulatory impact assessment was carried out on a number of enforcement options.</P>
        <P>The regulatory impact assessment concluded that the principal benefits of the Chemicals Bill should be high levels of compliance; reduced administrative costs to business, increased co-operation between the various national authorities that will be involved in enforcement and a coherent legal framework, which is an important factor for industry and which would also further the better regulation agenda.</P>
        <P>By taking the approach of putting all enforcement measures in one Bill, the Chemicals Bill should put in place a more streamlined and coherent legal framework for the regulation of chemicals in Ireland.  The detergents regulation, for example, which is currently given further effect by statutory instrument, has been brought within the scope of the Chemicals Bill to streamline and make more effective the national enforcement arrangements.  In addition, there are existing regulations applying to the control of major accident hazards made under the European Communities Act.  Remaking those regulations under this Bill will further streamline the approach to legislating for chemicals.</P>
        <P>I will outline to the House the provisions of the Bill.<b><i>  </i></b>Section 1<b><i> </i></b>is a standard section, providing for the Short Title of the Bill and the commencement on enactment of ministerial order of its various provisions. <b><i> </i></b>Section 2<b> </b>is a standard interpretation provision.  The Bill, the directly applicable EU regulations and any regulations that may be made under section 5 are collectively described as the relevant chemicals statutory provisions.  Section 3 is a standard section which <Col N="780"/>provides for the methods of serving notices under the Bill.  Section 4 is also a standard provision, providing for Exchequer funding of administrative expenses.</P>
        <P>Section 5 enables the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make regulations under the Bill.  EU regulations, as Deputies will be aware, are directly applicable but it can be necessary to make national regulations containing supplementary or incidental provisions.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may also, with the consent of each of the named Ministers with a specific functional responsibility, make regulations giving effect to an Act adopted by an institution of the European Union relating to chemicals, including the control of major accident hazards relating to chemicals.  As I mentioned, there are regulations under the European Communities Act governing this.  The provision in the Bill to make replacement regulations should result in a clearer legal framework.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides that the Health and Safety Authority can review legislation at the behest of the Minister or on its own initiative and make proposals to the Minister as appropriate.  Before it does so, it will be required to consult other parties, as appropriate.  This is similar to provisions in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</P>
        <P>The area of chemicals is complex and clear guidance will be required to help industry comply with the relevant statutory frameworks.  Accordingly, section 7 provides for national codes of practice to be drawn up by the Health and Safety Authority setting out practical guidance as regards compliance.  Section 8 prescribes the national authorities for the purposes of the EU regulations.  There are five national authorities named, spanning the functional responsibility areas of five Departments.  The Health and Safety Authority is given functions under all three EU regulations; the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is given functions relating to pesticides under the two relevant EU regulations; the Environmental Protection Agency is given functions under the REACH regulation in respect of the prevention of environmental pollution; the Minister for Health and Children is given a function under the EU detergents regulation relating to information on chemicals necessary for medical purposes; and the Revenue Commissioners are given a function for controlling exports and imports under the export and import regulation.  The nomination of the range of national authorities under the Bill reflects the horizontal nature of chemicals policy, ensures that the relevant expertise from across the whole system is part of the enforcement framework and reflects the policy choice of creating an enforcement network using existing structures.</P>
        <P>Section 9<b><i> </i></b>provides for co-operation among the national authorities in relation to their functions under the Bill.  The purpose of this provision is to encourage and facilitate optimal efficiency and effectiveness by national authorities in carrying out their functions.  The section also allows national authorities to make mutual co-operation arrangements with relevant authorities in other EU and EEA member states.  Section 10 allows a national authority, subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, to charge appropriate fees for the performance of its functions or the provision, by that national authority, of services.</P>
        <P>Sections 11 to 21 deal with enforcement.  Section 11 provides for the appointment of inspectors for the enforcement of the relevant statutory provisions and section 12 sets out their general powers. Section 13 provides for the immunity and indemnity of inspectors or members of staff of a national authority, while section 14<b><i> </i></b>allows an inspector to issue a direction for an improvement plan<b> </b>if he or she is of the opinion that an activity is being carried out that involves a risk to human health or the environment.</P>
        <P>Section 15 allows an inspector to issue a person with a contravention notice<b> </b>where the inspector is of the opinion that the person concerned is contravening the relevant chemicals statutory provisions.  This could include the removal from the market of a chemical.  Section 16<b><i> </i></b>provides <Col N="781"/>that an inspector may issue a prohibition notice<b> </b>if he or she is of the opinion that an activity is occurring that represents a serious risk to human health or the environment.  Section 17<i> </i>allows an inspector to apply to the High Court for an order enforcing compliance with a prohibition notice while<b><i> </i></b>section 18<b><i> </i></b>provides that a national authority may direct any of its staff or another appropriate person, other than an inspector, to carry out an investigation and make a report of that investigation.</P>
        <P>Section 19 applies where a national authority considers that an activity contravening the relevant chemicals statutory provisions is a serious risk to human health or the environment.  In such a case, the section provides that the national authority may apply to the High Court for an order prohibiting that activity.  Sections 20 and 21<b><i> </i></b>effectively enable officers of customs and excise to act in the general enforcement of statutory provisions governing chemicals and also to take action at the specific request of a national authority.</P>
        <P>Section 22<i> </i>allows a national authority, in the interests of protection of human health or the environment, to make public information on matters giving rise to the issuing of contravention notices or prohibition notices.  Section 23<b><i> </i></b>allows the Health and Safety Authority to publish a list of persons convicted of an offence under the relevant chemicals statutory provisions, persons on whom prohibition notices have been served or persons in respect of whom an order has been made under section 17 or 19.  This is partly a &ldquo;name and shame&rdquo; provision that should have a deterrent effect on would-be offenders, while<b><i> </i></b>section 24<i> </i>is a protection of whistleblowers provision.</P>
        <P>Section 25<i> </i>provides that national authorities may, by serving a notice, require persons to give relevant information to that national authority and section 26<b><i> </i></b>prohibits the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information.  Section 27<i> </i>sets out the offences under the Bill and section 28<b> </b>sets out the penalties for offences committed under section 27.  The maximum penalty on summary conviction is a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or six months imprisonment, or both.  For certain summary offences the penalty of imprisonment does not apply.  The maximum penalty on indictment is &euro;3 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both.</P>
        <P>Section 29 provides that the Minister may make regulations allowing inspectors to serve fixed payment notices in amounts up to a maximum of &euro;2,000 on persons who have committed an offence.  The regulations may set out different amounts for different offences.  Section 30 provides that where an offence under the Act is committed by a body corporate and that the act giving rise to the offence is proved to have been authorised by or a result of an omission by a director or manager of the body corporate, both the person and the body corporate are liable to be prosecuted.  Section 31 is a standard section and provides that a national authority may prosecute summary offences under the Act.  Section 32 sets out that notices or directions made under the Act shall be in writing while section 33 provides for regulations or orders to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 34 sets out two technical amendments to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</P>
        <P>The Bill sets out an enforcement system which aims to provide a clear regulatory framework for business to ensure high levels of compliance.  It also aims to achieve increased co-operation between the various national authorities that will be involved in enforcement to optimise the use of State resources and to alleviate any unnecessary administrative costs to business.  Compliance with the new chemicals regime by business should result in better management of the risks associated with the use of chemicals and, therefore, a positive longer-term health and environmental impact.  By taking the approach of putting all enforcement measures in one Bill, the legislation should put in place a more streamlined and coherent legal framework for the regulation of chemicals in Ireland.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="782"/>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael broadly supports the Bill.  We may table amendments later but we are happy with the Bill as drafted.  It is a complicated Bill.  When I received a copy of it, I hoped that my two years of chemistry lectures would be of some use but perhaps if I had studied law, I might have been better equipped to understand its provisions.  I acknowledge the work of the European Parliament, particularly in regard to the REACH directive.  The initial directive proposed by the Commission was far-reaching, anti-business and anti-industry but the important work done by the European Parliament, particularly by members of the European People&rsquo;s Party, the Party of European Socialists and the liberal group, has produced a more realistic directive, which balances the needs of industry and the importance of environmental protection and health and safety.</P>
        <P>The REACH directive replaces 40 legislative texts with a single regulatory system and it fits into the global harmonised system of classification.  While the Bill reflects the Seveso, REACH and the Rotterdam directives, it does not transpose the GHS directive.  I understand, following the regulatory impact analysis, it is intended to amend the Bill by means of statutory instrument or secondary legislation when the directive is agreed.  I share the view of Deputy Michael D. Higgins who is critical of the extent to which statutory instruments and secondary legislation are used.  I do not understand why the GHS directive cannot be incorporated in the Bill and commenced at a later date rather than amending the European Communities Act 1972.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise the importance of the manufacturing sector in Ireland.  We are often concerned and rightly critical about the demise of manufacturing but, at the same time, more than 200,000 people are employed in the sector, which is 11% of total employment in the State, and 25,000 are employed in the chemicals industry, which accounts for 23.3% in added value to the economy, as opposed to 1.7% for agriculture and 9% for construction.  We debate building and agriculture at length but the added value of the manufacturing industry is not mentioned very much.  It is important that legislation that impacts on manufacturing does not make it less competitive, and the Bill does not do so.</P>
        <P>It focuses on oversight of industry and enforcement procedures as the burden of proof regarding testing, and evaluation of the risks of chemicals is transferred to industry.  The Bill sets out the national authorities that will enforce the EU regulations and provides for co-operation among national authorities and between national authorities and authorities of other EU member states.  It lays down enforcement procedures and penalties for those industries found in breach of the EU regulations.  The Bill also aims to further the better regulation agenda by streamlining existing legislation in the area of chemicals enforcement into one Act.  I will refer to the RIA later.</P>
        <P>With regard to guidelines, the legislation provides for a code of practice to be drawn up by the Health and Safety Authority, setting out practical guidance as regards compliance.  The HSA will be given responsibility to review legislation and to make proposals to the Minister, as appropriate.  The authority has been designated as the national competence authority in this area, which is welcome.  I am glad the Minister resisted the temptation to establish a national chemicals agency, as is the wont of the Government, and a new board and headquarters with an annual report translated into Irish and a website.  I appreciate he resisted the opportunity to establish a new quango.  Other relevant authorities covered by the legislation include the Revenue Commissioners, the Ministers for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Health and Children and the Environmental Protection Agency.  National authorities must co-operate with each other in the performance of their functions under the Bill.  Such co-operation includes the carrying out of inspections or investigations and the sharing of information.  National authorities may also make mutual co-operation arrangements with authorities of EU member states and EEA states, subject to ministerial order.</P><Col N="783"/>
        <P>The Minister of State outlined enforcement procedures.  A national authority may appoint inspectors for the purposes of the enforcement of all or any of the relevant chemicals statutory provisions.  I am not clear as to whether these will be HSA inspectors or chemical inspectors, who would have to be appointed.  The Bill grants an inspector standard powers, provided in other Acts, to examine and search any place to which he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that the relevant chemicals statutory provisions apply; require that a location and anything at it be left undisturbed for so long as is reasonably necessary for the purpose of any search, examination, investigation, inspection or inquiry under the relevant chemicals statutory provisions; require the person in charge to produce any chemical or report relevant to the chemicals directive; remove records from that place and retain the records; require the person in charge to give him or her such assistance and facilities within the person&rsquo;s power or control as are reasonably necessary to enable him or her to exercise any of his or her powers; examine any person whom he or she reasonably believes to be able to give him or her information relevant to any search, examination, investigation, inspection or inquiry; take samples of air, soil, water or waste at or near that place; where appropriate, install, use and maintain at that place monitoring equipment; require the person in charge to supply the inspector, without charge, any chemicals or samples and to remove such chemicals; and take all steps to ensure product and company confidentiality.</P>
        <P>I read the Competition Authority&rsquo;s submission regarding amendments to the Competition Act.  The authority has similar inspection powers but it raised the issue of inspecting cars and vehicles.  When the Act is amended, the authority is seeking the inclusion of a provision for its officers to inspect private or company cars on site because they have had problems in this regard during inspections.  Should that provision be included in this legislation?  For example, if relevant information, documentation or samples are in a vehicle, there may be a difficulty using it as evidence without specifically stating in legislation that the inspector may access vehicles.</P>
        <P>An inspector under this legislation can ask for an improvement plan and can issue a contravention notice.  Provision is also made for an inspector to go to the High Court, which the Minister outlined.  A national authority, in the interests of protection of human health or the environment, may publicise information relating to matters giving rise to the issuing of contravention notices or prohibition notices.  The HSA may from time to time compile and publish a list of persons convicted of an offence under the relevant chemicals statutory provisions and on whom prohibition notices have been served.</P>
        <P>I hope this will happen.  A number of naming and shaming provisions exist in legislation.  The employment compliance Bill will also include for the first time provision for naming and shaming.  I do not see much naming and shaming being done and I would like to see people who transgress laws being named and shamed more often.  The Revenue Commissioners name and shame tax defaulters but I rarely see planning authorities naming and shaming.  I hope it will become the normal practice for violators of environmental legislation and legislation such as this to be named and shamed.  It is a very effective tool for promoting compliance to embarrass and shame people when they break the rules.</P>
        <P>As referred to by the Minister of State the offences and penalties include a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or six months imprisonment or both and a maximum penalty on indictment to be &euro;3 million or a term of imprisonment not to exceed two years or both.  The aim in this legislation would be for compliance rather than imprisonment but naming and shaming could be very useful.  We may even propose an amendment requiring that people be named and shamed in certain circumstances.</P><Col N="784"/>
        <P>Where an offence under the Act is committed by a body corporate and that act giving rise to the offence was authorised by a director or manager of the body corporate, both the person and the body corporate are liable to be prosecuted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If I may digress, I know that most Members of the House would be aware of my interest in regulation and the better regulation agenda.  I am pleased that at long last the Government has agreed to a 25% target for the reduction of the administrative costs of regulation by 2012.  I am yet to be convinced that the Government is serious about this matter.  We have yet to calculate what the base figure is so that a reduction of 25% can be achieved.  The absence of baseline calculations is very worrying.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Financial Regulator attended the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs on Tuesday and was unable to inform the committee what is its baseline calculation for the cost of financial regulation.  This figure had not been requested by the Government.  I ask how one can go from 100% to 75% without knowing what 100% is.</P>
        <P>The regulatory impact analysis in this case outlines four options.  One option is to do nothing which is not really an option and neither is self-regulation an option.  The third option is to use existing legislation and the fourth option is new legislation.  This is not really what a regulatory impact assessment is supposed to do, in my opinion.  A regulatory impact assessment is supposed to make a financial calculation as to the cost of these regulations.  It may well be the case that this is an example of better regulation and of reorganising and reducing large amounts of legislation into one Bill.  What should happen in a regulatory impact assessment, in my view, is a calculation as to what are the savings in the cost of regulation.  If one is serious about achieving that target, this might be an example of how one can begin to do so.  A financial calculation could be made by using the standard costs model to find out the net savings on the administrative burden of regulation by replacing the existing large body of regulation with this new streamlined system.  More important, that calculation analyses and proves whether it really is the case that this legislation streamlines regulation and reduces administrative costs; without doing that calculation we are depending on a political statement that this is streamlining.</P>
        <P>The regulatory impact assessment does not consider the impact of EU legislation but only the impact of the Chemicals Bill.  This is probably reasonable in that the Lisbon target exists for European legislation.  I have referred to the impact on business and on the manufacturing sector.  The regulatory impact assessment states that the Bill will have no impact on national competitiveness and I accept this assessment.  It will not have an impact on socially excluded and vulnerable groups but it will benefit the environment.  It will have a positive impact for consumers and for competition because of the better information available to consumers.  In terms of compliance, the only compliance burden in the Bill is the cost associated with the resources devoted to facilitating inspections and compliance checks but there is no calculation of the cost provided.  This is not acceptable or adequate, in my view; a school child will know that.  Where is the financial calculation of what those costs are?  It also states that these costs are borne by industry in facilitating such inspections and checks under the existing health and safety and environmental legislation.  I am not clear in my understanding of this aspect.  It is stated that the policy objective is to minimise the administrative costs to industry but there is no calculation provided.  Is it the case that industry will be paying for the inspections?  Will there be a form of levy on chemicals?  How is it argued in the regulatory impact assessment that the costs will be borne by industry?  This may be as a result of my own ignorance but is there some form of chemicals or other levy which the industry must pay in this regard?</P>
        <P>I have referred to the global harmonised system regulation and my concerns about what would appear to be some plans to use secondary legislation to include this in the Bill at a later stage.  I would be very concerned about such a plan.</P><Col N="785"/>
        <P>My party offers general support to this legislation which derives largely from the REACH directive, which we strongly supported in the European Parliament.  I do not think this legislation will have major negative impacts on competitiveness; it may even be of benefit in terms of regulation but I would like to see proper calculations and I would like some answers on the GHS regulation in particular.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party I want to offer a broad welcome to this Bill.  The Bill has obviously been subject to a significant background review in the context of the REACH regulation and consolidates the enforcement of a number of European laws in the chemicals area.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I am greatly indebted to the staff of the Oireachtas Library research service for bringing this subject down to some degree of common sense.  I compliment them on their work and also compliment the work of the environmental scientists there who are excellent and most helpful, which I wish to acknowledge on the record of the House.  People like me are grateful to them.  Despite being a barrister and despite being familiar with nuanced elements and provisions of legislation, I found this a complex Bill.  One would expect it to be so because it deals with a significant amount of legislation.  This is a framework Bill introducing a regulatory framework which is extremely important.  At least it will all be collated in one source which is important for industry.  It will bring into play the Council Regulation EC 1907/2006 concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals &mdash; the REACH regulation which came into force on 1 June 2007.  This is urgent legislation from our perspective in so far as it must be enacted by 1 June 2008.  It also deals with Council directives on the control of major accident hazards, the Seveso Directive, Council Regulation EC 648/2004 on detergents and Council Regulation EC304/2003, concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals.</P>
        <P>This Bill is very important in that context and this is the reason it must be supported because it will ensure that Ireland is in compliance with EU legislation through the denomination of national authorities and the identification of methods of enforcement through the imposition of penalties for matters of non-compliance.  This is very important legislation in the absence of strict enforcement and regulatory framework.  It is dealing with matters that may well have an impact not just on human life but also on the environment.  We are all aware of the importance of the control of production of the manufacture and use of chemicals from the perspective of the protection of human health and the protection of a safe environment.  The focus of this Bill is to protect human health and to protect the environment from potential harm.  These are worthy objectives to which we all subscribe.  We may wish to table amendments on Committee Stage.  However, the Bill is generally successful in encompassing the thrust of the EU provisions, with which we must comply.</P>
        <P>The implementation of this legislation will undoubtedly lead to some costs that must be borne by industry in respect of inspections and non-compliance.  The policy objective must be to minimise these administrative costs as much as possible.  However, a broad overview of the cost benefit analysis suggests that national competitiveness will be enhanced by the implementation of a more cohesive and focused regulatory regime, as set out in the Bill.  It is important to acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>There is existing legislation which applies to human and veterinary medicines and to food flavourings and foodstuffs in general.  We have a fine and significant corpus of legislation in this regard.  This Bill incorporates the relevant EU regulations and directives on the authorisation and control of chemical substances.  The REACH regulation requires transposition into Irish law by 1 June 2008.  The urgency of the Chemicals Bill hinges on this far-reaching legislation.</P><Col N="786"/>
        <P>The Bill has implications for manufacturers, importers, formulators, distributors and users of chemicals.  It places a clear onus on the companies concerned.  That is an important consideration for any legislation.  Too often in legislation there is reference to Tweedledum and Tweedledee but no clear indication of precisely where the onus lies.  In this case, however, it is placed firmly on the companies concerned, which must devise appropriate strategies to ensure they become REACH-compliant.</P>
        <P>I understand the pre-evaluation process and so on has been completed but there may well be teething problems given the significant number of chemical substances currently in use, spanning a broad range of industrial and household purposes.  These will have to undergo health and safety screening before being submitted to the registration process.  The legislation effectively transfers responsibility for the control and safety of chemicals from the various supervisory authorities to the chemicals industry itself.  The greatest level of responsibility in this regard will rest with manufacturers, but all links in the chain, including distributors, importers and users of chemicals, must adhere to the relevant obligations.  That is clearly set out in the Bill.  The REACH regulation will be beneficial in so far as it invests control and power in one regulatory body.  The system of regulation will likewise be simplified.</P>
        <P>In examining the background to this legislation, I received excellent assistance from the Oireachtas research staff.  I compliment them on their efficiency and helpfulness.  I understand the REACH regulation was one of the most intensely lobbied legislative proposals at EU level in recent years.  The then Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, was in Brussels in November 2005 and on other occasions to discuss the legislative proposals.  There were various attempts to reduce the scope of the Bill and dilute its provisions.  However, its central tenet remains the placing of the burden of proof on manufacturers to show that some 30,000 commonly used industrial chemicals and substances that were placed on the market by them are safe and pose no threat to human health or the environment.  These are serious concerns.</P>
        <P>At the same time, many of these chemicals are essential for the production of various goods and processes which are of benefit to consumers.  A balance was therefore required.  Genuine concerns have been expressed that the legislation might go overboard, making the process of manufacturing so prohibitive from a cost perspective that it would have implications for our economic competitiveness.  Nevertheless, the primary focus must be to ensure that chemicals, of whatever nature, do not threaten human health or damage the environment.</P>
        <P>In October 2006, the EU&rsquo;s environmental committee rejected an amendment to the legislation that would have required the EU to accept data prepared for the OECD, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and other chemical regulators.  On 18 December 2006, an agreement was reached with the European Council on the REACH proposal.  This obliged producers to register all chemical substances produced or imported above a total quantity of one tonne per year.  This provision has come into force progressively from June 2007.  The Minister of State observed that it will take some 11 years to complete the process and that all relevant substances will have to be registered by 2018.  It is a significant undertaking.  In the meantime, pre-registration requirements must be met.</P>
        <P>The European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki will be responsible for the authorisation process.  The former President of the European Parliament, Mr. Josep Borrell, described the REACH regulation as one of the most complex texts in the history of the EU.  He also observed that it was essential to protect public health and the environment from the risk of chemical substances without threatening European competitiveness.  The Government played a significant role in the development of the EU provisions and was acutely aware of their significance. <Col N="787"/> It supported the objective of the legislation while seeking to ensure a degree of balance, with particular reference to the concerns of the manufacturing industry.  We discussed the continuing threats to our manufacturing base with the Minister, Deputy Martin, during Question Time yesterday.  There are some 230,000 people employed in this area and we must ensure it remains competitive and continues to grow.  As the Minister observed, the growth of the last decade will be difficult to sustain, but the industry remains an important source of employment.  We must provide the support necessary to allow it continue as such in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>As I understand it, chemical substances will be categorised according to a defined gradation.  The European Chemicals Agency will be responsible for the authorisation function.  This transfer of responsibility for the testing and evaluation of chemicals represents a change in the traditional practice.  Instead of public authorities being obliged to prove that a particular substance is dangerous, the onus is now on the producers to prove it is safe.  That is an important change.</P>
        <P>It is clear that Ireland played its role in formulating the provisions that ultimately emerged.  There were balances to be struck between the concerns of an industry which serves as an important source of employment and the important objective of ensuring that neither human health nor the environment is put at risk.  The Bill before us achieves that proportionality.  I understand the Health and Safety Authority will have a role to play.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will deal with pesticides.  The EPA will deal with the REACH regulatory function.  The Minister for Health and Children will deal with the detergents regulation.  The Revenue Commissioners will deal with controlling and exporting the various substances.</P>
        <P>One of the problems to which Deputy Varadkar referred is whether authorities, such as the Health and Safety Authority, which already have a significant workload will have the resources and personnel to ensure the objectives of this legislation will be carried out with regard to scrutiny on compliance and enforcement.  One could postulate that one will never have enough personnel to carry out all the functions of a Bill.  It could go on to infinity as new areas are developed and new products come on stream which must be dealt with.  However, it is important that additional staff are allocated to enable the legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas to be implemented.  Deputy Varadkar made the point that there is nothing worse than legislation being passed which becomes nullified because its effectiveness is lost by the failure to ensure it is implemented in the way it should be.</P>
        <P>This has gone through a process with industry groups and one anticipates they have been attuned to the issues and that the information and the contents of the legislation have been disseminated to the various constituent bodies of the business and industrial groups.  It is important that they are fully aware of this and dry runs and screenings have already taken place.  The regulation on the import and export of dangerous chemicals implements the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade.</P>
        <P>This appears to be all about the headline industries.  What will happen to the downstream industries which will utilise chemicals?  How will this impact on them?  Will the same level of regulation apply to them?  We discussed regulation with ISME and other such groups who came before the joint Oireachtas committee and over-regulation is a major problem.  Every Oireachtas Member, councillor and aspiring public representative knows that a business can be strangled by the level of bureaucracy imposed.  Small and medium enterprises are still the lifeblood of many areas throughout the country.  Will we make it difficult for them to survive?  Has a cost benefit analysis been carried out to ensure the obligations with which they must comply will not be of such a nature that the entire system will be put out of place?</P><Col N="788"/>
        <P>A significant element of the Bill comprising ten sections pertains to enforcement functions.  This is well and good and as Deputy Varadkar mentioned, it contains a name and shame provision.  Those who contravene or fail to act in compliance with the obligations imposed upon them by the legislation will have their names published.  The idea is that this will have a deterrent effect on others who might contemplate not complying with the express wishes of the Oireachtas laid down when a Bill of this nature is passed.</P>
        <P>I notice a parallel with the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  This is useful because the same procedures will be utilised in terms of improvement, contravention or prohibition notices.  With regard to enforcement penalties and provisions, in the case of a minor breach will someone be brought before the District Court to be dealt with in a summary fashion rather than put through a more rigorous process?  Will a person only be brought to court if he or she fails to comply with the various notices served?  A minor or technical breach may be involved and we should not need to bring the entire armoury or panoply of the State enforcement system into play.  A person or company should be given an opportunity to remedy the position, rectify the grievance which inspectors discovered and ensure compliance.</P>
        <P>The Seveso directives came about because of a major accident in the chemical industry in Italy in 1976.  The aim of these is one to which everyone subscribes, which is to prevent further major accident hazards involving dangerous substances and, where accidents do occur, to limit the damage to human health and the environment.  Rather than having this split between various Bills, it has been brought under one umbrella and this is important.</P>
        <P>The detergents regulation deals with biodegradability testing requirements and providing better information on detergent labels.  It requires manufacturers to produce safety data sheets for the medical profession and for consumers.  This has been raised at European level and officials from one of the Departments explained it to us.  In this context, labelling is extremely important so people are made more aware.  Labels should be in readable form.</P>
        <P>I broadly welcome the Bill.  I am amenable to ensuring it is passed as quickly as possible to meet our deadlines.  The last thing we want is the European Commission imposing fines on us.  We have enough places to utilise our moneys without paying fines.  Will the Department officials produce an easy to read digest to the legislation?  It is complex and Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s opening comments are apposite and correct.  The essential elements of the legislation could be simplified and put into a small handbook.  This would be useful not only for the manufacturers, producers and distributors involved, but also for people using detergents in domestic situations.  It will ensure they have the full details of the products with which they are dealing and will also make them aware of the system of regulations in place and what are the remedies for breaches and non-compliance with the legislation.  It would be a useful adjunct to the Bill.</P>

	<P>I, too, acknowledge the work of Irish members of the European Parliament in the formation of the EU REACH regulation, in particular, Liam Aylward, MEP, whom I know worked on it for more than two years.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers mentioned the importance of the manufacturing industry in Ireland, in particular chemical and pharmaceutical plants which are prevalent in my constituency of Dublin North and in Swords, and which provide significant quality employment for people there.  As <Col N="789"/>mentioned, the Chemicals Bill is complex as it derives from EU regulations.  It is relevant not alone to business but to citizens in Ireland in general.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister take on board Deputy Penrose&rsquo;s suggestion that citizens be issued with a guide on the regulations and their rights in this regard.  This is important legislation.  A number of years were spent formulating the regulations in Europe and it is important that when the Bill is enacted Irish citizens are familiar with them.</P>
        <P>Enactment of the Chemicals Bill will fulfil a commitment made by the Government under the programme for Government to implement and give effect to a regulatory framework to oversee the manufacturing and day-to-day use of chemicals in Ireland.  The Bill is formed in such a way as to ensure that these regulations will in no way negatively impact on the competitiveness of our economy, which is crucial.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill contains two main policy objectives, to ensure that we achieve a high level of compliance while ensuring we minimise the costs to industry of complying with the terms of the Bill.  As mentioned by previous speakers, it is vitally important we do not strangle companies with additional regulation.  The main measures of the Bill are to designate a number of national agencies, including the EPA, the Health and Safety Authority, the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Health and Children and the Revenue Commissioners as responsible for specific areas of enforcement to ensure compliance with the new regulations; to allow national authorities to carry out joint enforcement measures in co-operation with each other &mdash; it is crucial there is co-ordination in this regard &mdash; thereby making the best of existing State resources, minimising administration costs to business and enabling State authorities to share relevant information with each other and, when deemed necessary, other EU member states; to bring into law a range of enforcement powers aimed at encouraging compliance, including issuing directions to business and industry to ensure improvement plans are put in place; to issue contravention and prohibition notices; and to provide the relevant State agencies with the power to apply to courts for orders to ban specific activities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not often agree with Deputy Varadkar but it is crucial the provisions for naming and shaming are used by the State in this regard.  We are all aware of the damage caused to the environment and human health by the misuse of chemicals and other products.  It is crucial we are serious about enforcing these provisions and that when misuse occurs the State uses the full power of the law available to it.</P>
        <P>The Bill introduces penalties of up to &euro;5,000 and-or six months imprisonment for summary offences and &euro;3 million and-or two years imprisonment for indictable offences.  Of particular importance are on-the-spot fines of up to &euro;2,000 for minor offences.  This is not about fining or imprisoning people but ensuring compliance with the legislation.  Provision is also made for making available public information deemed in the interest of protecting human health and the environment.  This could be commenced by the distribution of a user-friendly handbook to citizens and companies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not know if it has been mentioned but the protection of whistleblowers is important.  We rely on such persons to report breaches of chemicals law.  It is crucial these people and their rights are protected.  I am certain the public will welcome these measures that will bring about much-needed regulation and, more importantly, enhance the protection of citizens and the environment from unscrupulous individuals and businesses who flout the law by using chemicals in a manner that is damaging to health and the environment.</P>
        <P>Businesses and individuals who manufacture and use chemicals will have concerns about whether this Bill will place on them heavy burdens of compliance thereby increasing costs to their operations.  It is important to state that the only compliance burden associated with this Bill is that businesses and individuals facilitate compliance checks and inspections.  These costs <Col N="790"/>already exist in industry which facilitates inspections and checks under health and safety regulations and existing environmental checks.</P>
        <P>Industry will benefit by having a clear regulatory framework within which to work.  The public and industry will benefit from the provisions of this Bill.  It will ensure high levels of compliance, tangible reduced administration costs to business and clear and coherent legislation which provides an open legal framework within which Industry can operate.  It will also provide much-needed increased co-operation between various national authorities, which is crucial.  I am glad a separate agency has not been set up to deal with this issue.  It is important we ensure, through our agencies, that the Bill when enacted is complied with.  Obviously, a lead-in time will be provided but it is crucially important if this is to work that there is co-operation between the various agencies.</P>
        <P>If we assume that with this legislation we will achieve high levels of compliance in regard to how industry uses and manufactures chemicals, Ireland will benefit from reductions in costs associated with public health and through further protection of our environment, thereby saving on environmental remediation costs.  There are also real benefits to the consumer with the enactment of this Bill.  Irish consumers will have much clearer and better information on chemicals and chemical usage in day-to-day products.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As mentioned by Deputy Varadkar, the sharing of chemical information between EU states and particularly between authorities in the North and Britain should ensure greater protection for all people on this island.  For industry, it will provide a much clearer EU-wide framework on the use and manufacture of chemicals in all member states, thereby making it easier to do business across the EU and on the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I believe that the approach taken in this Bill provides for a flexible and proportionate range of compliance measures.  The legislation should act as a major deterrent to any person or business who through bad business practice and procedures puts at risk human health and the environment.  Any person or business who breaks the law should be named and shamed and dealt with using the full severity of the penalties contained in this Bill.  It is important that the public knows that where its health or the protection and enhancement of our environment is put at risk, offenders will be dealt with using the full provisions contained in this Bill.</P>
        <P>I do not want it to be the case that penalties of a minor nature only are issued.  If we are serious about protecting our environment and our health, the Government must deal seriously with offenders.  I am pleased to note that within this legislation there are provisions to publish the names and addresses of those subjected to penalties, court convictions, prohibition notices and High Court orders, prosecute offenders in the District Court or the Circuit Court and provide fixed payment notices for summary offences.</P>
        <P>The Government has given firm commitments under the programme for Government to protect and further enhance our environment for future generations and to ensure that public health is protected.  The Bill goes part of the way to delivering on that commitment.  I support the provisions contained in this Bill and acknowledge its welcome by Deputies Varadkar and Penrose on behalf of their parties.  I believe this legislation will be good for the public and for industry.  I urge all Members to support this well thought-out legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrickFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Chemicals Bill.  It fulfils a commitment under the programme for Government to implement the European Union regulatory framework governing the manufacture and use of chemicals and does not impact on the competitiveness of our economy.  The Bill will put in place an administrative framework for the enforcement of various pieces of EU chemicals legislation.  It includes no substantive <Col N="791"/>rules on chemicals because they are already contained in the EU regulations, which are directly applicable in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The measures proposed in the Bill include the designation of national authorities, including the Health and Safety Authority, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Minister for Health and Children, and the Revenue Commissioners, to be responsible for specific areas of enforcement that draws on the most relevant expertise and areas of competence across the system.  The Bill also proposes co-operation arrangements for national authorities to carry out joint enforcement activities to ensure the best use of our resources.  It will minimise administrative costs to business since it provides for strong co-operation between national authorities, and it provides for authorities to share information with each other and with authorities in other EU member states.  The Bill also proposes a range of enforcement powers aimed at encouraging compliance and discouraging non-compliance, including the issuing of directions for improvement plans, the issuing of contravention notices and prohibition notices, and powers to apply to the courts for orders prohibiting certain activities.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill for substantial penalties, including up to a fine of &euro;5,000 and six months&rsquo; imprisonment for summary offences, a fine of &euro;3 million and two years&rsquo; imprisonment for indictable offences, and the on-the-spot fines of up to &euro;2,000 for minor offences.  I also welcome the provision for making public certain information in the interests of protecting human health or the environment.  This is an important element of the bill, as is the protection of whistleblowers in the event of breaches of chemicals law being reported in good faith.</P>
        <P>The two main policy objectives of the Bill are to achieve a high level of compliance and to minimise the administrative cost to industry.  To achieve these objectives, the Bill aims to provide a clear regulatory framework for business and to increase co-operation between the various national authorities involved in enforcement.  This will support high levels of compliance and should alleviate any unnecessary administrative costs to business.</P>
        <P>A regulatory impact analysis considered the costs and benefits likely to arise from a number of options regarding the enforcement of current and pending EU chemicals regulations.  The analysis concluded that the principal benefits of the Chemicals Bill should be high levels of compliance, reduced administrative costs to business, increased co-operation between the various national authorities involved in enforcement and a coherent legal framework.  Industry will benefit by having a clear regulatory framework in which to operate.  The Bill provides for increased co-operation among national authorities and between national authorities and authorities in other member states, and enforcing a number of different pieces of legislation under the one Bill has the potential to minimise administration costs and will be of benefit to industry.  In the course of inspections, national authorities could check compliance with all legislation in the scope of the Bill at the same time, thereby saving industry time and money.  Increased co-operation among national authorities and agencies, such as the HSA, the EPA, the pesticide control service and Customs and Excise, should also facilitate a greater level of information exchange and should minimise the need for individual businesses to supply the same information to a number of different bodies.</P>
        <P>The costs associated with public health and environmental remediation would be significantly reduced by a high level of compliance with this chemicals legislation.  The reputation of the State will benefit from introducing the regulatory regime.  The provisions to make replacement regulations for the Seveso or control of major accident hazards regulations should result in a clearer enforcement framework.  This should result in increased compliance with the regulations and a consequent lower risk of major accidents occurring.  The Chemicals Bill will have no <Col N="792"/>negative impact on national competitiveness.  On the contrary, there should be a benefit to national competitiveness arising from the improved regulatory efficiency it aims to introduce.</P>
        <P>Compliance with the new chemicals regime by industry should result in better management of the risks associated with the use of chemicals and therefore a positive longer-term environmental impact.  A positive impact on customers and competition can be expected as the Chemicals Bill contains provisions to ensure better information on chemicals for customers.  Benefits will arise from co-operation and mutual assistance arrangements among the national authorities under the Bill and competent authorities in Northern Ireland and the UK, thus having a positive impact on North-South and east-west relations.  The Health and Safety Authority has already taken part in joint awareness raising and training initiatives.</P>
        <P>The only compliance burden with this Bill is the cost of facilitating inspections and compliance checks.  These are already borne by industry in facilitating inspections and checks under existing health and safety and environmental legislation.  The policy objective is to minimise the administrative cost to industry.  The Bill provides for compliance approaches that emphasise measures that fall short of prosecution.  These include serving a direction for an improvement plan, which will require the submission within one month of an improvement plan setting out how the company proposes to address the risk that is the subject of the plan.  Enforcement notices may also be served to deal with a failure to comply with the law.  A contravention notice will give a period of time for the matter to be remedied, and a prohibition notice will require that the activity that has created the risk to human health or the environment is stopped immediately.  The Bill also provides for application to the High Court for an order prohibiting or restricting the activity.</P>
        <P>Deterrence approaches that are penal and use prosecutions in order to deter future breaches include provision for specification in regulations of fixed payment notices for summary offences, the prosecution of offences in either the District or Circuit Courts and the publication of the names and addresses of those subjected to a prohibition notice, High Court order or a penalty following a court conviction.</P>
        <P>The three EU regulations being given further effect by the Bill are as follows: the EU REACH regulation, the EU regulation concerning the export and import of certain dangerous chemicals under the Rotterdam convention and the EU detergents regulation.  The EU detergents and export-import regulations are currently subject to enforcement measures in different statutory instruments, which will be repealed in due course.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill, and I wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like others, I am glad to have the opportunity to make a contribution on the Bill.  It is interesting and timely that we should discuss the subject.  It has engaged us all over the years in various instances.  Chemicals, preservation and all that goes with it now form so much part of our society and even our diet.  If we read the ingredients on a food product, we are liable to find it contains certain chemicals &mdash; E chemicals in particular.  Some of them are deemed to be bad for our health, but they are frequently used.  Many people have particular allergies to the E-number chemicals and other preservatives in our food chain and part of our daily diet, and I wonder whether the Bill is likely to cover those preservatives or alter them in any way.  For example, DDT, a famous chemical which was a great controlling agent and widely used here, is gone.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We all do.  Ironically, other countries still use the product, often on our food products that we import.  There is a certain contradiction in that that leaves me askance.  If it was bad for us here, surely it is still bad.  There is an ongoing international argument whereby in the countries in which it is still permissible to use it, it is seen as the lesser of evils, that it does more good than harm.  This begs the question why we got rid of it in the first place.  There is a contradiction in the whole area of the use of chemicals in the food sector, in particular in the growing of food and the use of herbicides, pesticides and so on.  The reason I mention this is that it is timely to have a look at those items and ascertain whether the legislation covers all, any or none of those.  I honestly do not know.  Perhaps the Minister of State would refer to that in his reply.  As an amateur gardener and food grower I take a special interest in these things.</P>

	<P Just="Left">To those who speak about organic growing and so on, I know all there is to be known about it and I know how difficult it is.  I am in favour of organic growing but if anybody thinks we will be able to supply the food requirements of the world organically we have another hard lesson coming to us, because it does not work that way.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to look carefully at what we are doing and, by all means, let us do it if it is good for us and if its possible but let us not cod ourselves and shelter under an umbrella that has holes.  Do not let us soldier on in the belief that what we are doing is correct because it does not apply to the rest of the world.  They export their goods and their food into this jurisdiction and it is considered all right for us to consume it then.  Certainly that is a laugh.</P>
        <P>In supermarkets all over the country it is possible to identify food products that have been subjected to chemicals that have been banned here for many years, and which are banned in the context of this legislation.  The question arises as to how serious we are about these issues.  It is all right if we import them but it is all wrong if we grow them.</P>
        <P>There is a number of chemicals, particularly in the horticultural and farming areas, with which I am familiar, such as herbicides, having worked with them over many years, which have been quite helpful.  Those that leave a residual build up are the most dangerous because they have a cumulative effect.  They build up in the soil and multiply as time goes by and never leave the system.  Those are the chemicals about which I am most concerned.  However, there are others that do a good job, have few ill effects and are beneficial.  I mention these at the outset even though the Minister of State should have a thorough knowledge of them given the constituency from which he hails.  Nationally and internationally, people will always legislate for the things that upset them unless it affects them directly and economically.  It raises a different hare if it does.</P>
        <P>I turn to the question of importation.  We have good chemical manufacturers here.  In regard to the Cork scene, the Minister of State needs to be careful to avoid a dramatic negative impact in the event of large-scale manufacturing of chemicals in our own back yard.  In some cases we export them and we use some in the domestic market.  We must ensure that if there is a ban on a particular substance that we do not wake up some morning and find that the chemical manufacturing plant has closed because there was not adequate warning.  There is a need for scaling down and a recognition that the process is harmful.  It must be proved that it is harmful <Col N="794"/>and changes have to be made.  I do not wish to dwell on past history in regard to emissions.  If it affects employment it is simple until it comes to one&rsquo;s own back yard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The shipping of hazardous substances is one of the major problems, particularly since the history of such transport has led us to the conclusion that in not all cases has the crewing of ships met the highest international standards.  Not all the hulls tested, where transportation is taking place inside damage-proof casks, are safe in the event of shipwreck etc.  That applies to oil, gases and so on but it applies particularly to hazardous substances.  I ask the Minister for an assurance that irrespective of what rules and regulations apply, they must apply from production to shipping and road transport, ensuring the public is protected in every circumstance.</P>
        <P>I turn to the area of road transportation.  Often one is driving at night and one pulls up behind a vehicle with a sign which indicates it is carrying hazardous material but one hopes it is empty or the material is stable.  Given that not all transportation that takes place here is done to the highest standard of specification, where vehicles have the potential to come in direct contact with the general public and thereby create a serious health hazard the legislation covers it.  There is also the whole question of dangerous substances and spillages.  As my good friend and colleague, Deputy Michael Fitzpatrick, will recall, I remember in our county there was a simple spillage of diesel and suddenly it ended up in the water supply because of the network of drains, pipes and so on.  Everybody could taste it.  One can imagine the dangers to the general public if a more poisonous material got into the water supply.</P>
        <P>We have a national emergency plan about which I have asked many questions in the past.  I was inspired over the years to ask more questions to the extent that I was of the opinion that I knew nothing about the subject.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I am amazed at that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can well understand how the Chair would be amazed.  I too was amazed.  Despite asking all those questions about that subject I ended, at the heel of the hunt, where I started &mdash; raising more questions about it.  I am glad to say that recently some positive movement has taken place.  I am glad to hear we have been forewarned.  We have got the St. John of it already through the bigger plan that is coming.  I welcome that because a national emergency could come from dangerous spillages, a terrorist attack or a terrorist attack on a storage plant that could result in a dangerous spillage.  There are many variations of an emergency that might present itself.  I am glad something is being done about that and that something has been put on paper.  I am sure we will hear more about it at a later stage.  Over the years, Deputies have been made aware of various chemicals which may have carcinogenic properties.  The high incidence of cancer means everyone is conscious that certain chemicals may be conducive to the spread of cancer.  While I am aware that this issue is covered at European level, I hope none of the products we import, which must comply with regulations, is potentially harmful.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on this issue.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the use of preservatives and other methods of preservation, such as irradiation, in the food chain.  After so many years as a Deputy, I have been my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on most issues.  Like Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor, I have done nearly everything at this stage, although I have not yet mentioned Tallaght today &mdash; I may do so in a moment.  In studying these matters, I learned about the extent of the use of irradiation for preservation purposes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Although the debate on this process has been done and dusted for about 20 years, I am not aware of the evidence base for setting aside concerns about irradiation.  One can buy unrefrigerated fruit and vegetables in the shops and supermarkets that are one or two months old, the reason being that they have been subject to irradiation.  What conclusive evidence is available to show irradiation is harmless?  Having spent considerable time reading about it, I am not certain it is harmless.  Is it permitted on the basis of the balance of available evidence or because the alternative may be a shortage of food?  If it is fear of food shortages, that argument could be applied in many other areas.  I ask the Minister of State to comment.</P>
        <P>For the first time in 50 years, the European Union is experiencing a deficit in food supplies.  This is ironic given that the European Economic Community was established, in the first instance, to counter the problem of food scarcity.  In the past 18 months, EU imports of food have increased to their highest ever level.  We do not know what preservatives are used on these products, whether irradiation has been used or if the processes used comply with European Union regulations.  Perhaps the necessity to have access to a steady food supply is considered the lesser of two evils.</P>
        <P>The use of detergents has been raised in the House on many occasions and Deputies have heard arguments at local and national level about their widespread availability.  While the argument that these substances are harmless has not stood up, nor has the argument that they are a somehow evil.  I seek further information in this regard.</P>
        <P>This wide-ranging legislation covers the full spectrum of chemicals.  The approach taken by other EU member states must be borne in mind.  I note the Health and Safety Authority will draw up national codes of practice.  Would it not be preferable to give one Department responsibility for all regulation in this area?  Is it not inadvisable to give different Departments responsibility for different areas?  The Health Service Executive illustrates the problem I highlight.  A large number of individuals at senior level of the HSE have authority and responsibility but no one is in charge.  This is not an implied criticism of the Minister or anyone else, but a fact of life.  As all elected public representatives are aware, all organisations, whether a large business or a local shop, are full of executives who have responsibility.  The problem is that one can never find the person with ultimate responsibility.  Similarly, the danger with legislation of this nature is that when one dishes out responsibility as if one were dealing cards, one can be certain that nobody will take responsibility.</P>
        <P>The Bill refers to five different national authorities spanning the functional responsibilities of five different Departments.  How could one go wrong?  If one authority fails, responsibility shifts to the second, third or perhaps fifth body.</P>

We also write to An Bord Plean&aacute;la because it shares responsibility in this area and local authorities because they give the initial planning permission for the operation of landfills, for which strict regulations are laid down.  However, when one writes to planning authorities they respond that the matter is the responsibility of the EPA. </P>
        <P>I am concerned about the decision to have five or six agencies involved in this area.  The more one spreads the burden of responsibility, the less accountability one gets.  It is as short and simple as that.  Unfortunately, I do not have time to discuss in detail the various sections of the Bill.  I will give the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, some advice.  He is an <Col N="796"/>experienced politician and should not be led by experts, advisers or anyone else on this legislation.  He will find that following his own heart and mind is a hell of a lot better and dependable than taking advice from specialists and experts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the most enlightening and pleasing facet of Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s contribution was his interest in organic gardening.  I will share with the House my interest in reading, which probably got me into the Green Party.  In the 1970s, I read a most incredible book entitled<i> Silent Spring </i>by Rachel Carson, which tells the story of chemical contamination in the United States.  It had a profound effect on my future politics as well as on how we treat, store, ship and transport chemicals.  The author, Ms Rachel Carson, had to spend a good deal of her scientific life defending her reputation and I am glad to say she was vindicated in the end.  I very much welcome the introduction of this Bill to the D&aacute;il.  For many years the track record of many countries, including our own, has been poor and this is an opportunity for that to be addressed.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The transposition of the REACH directive is very important and the benefits of the Bill, such as the implementation of the &ldquo;no data, no market&rdquo; principle &mdash; producers or importers not being able to introduce a chemical onto the market without recording the details of it &mdash; is very significant and important.  We should not have to read the tiny print with binoculars.  We should be able to access that information very clearly to monitor what passes through our countries.  This means better control.  Where possible, the chemicals industry will have to use alternative, and sometimes safer, substances to some of the more toxic substances being used in industry.  The rights of consumers and producers to obtain information on dangerous substances included an incredible number of chemicals listed in the directive, more than 30,000.  This is a very positive step which will increase transparency and accountability in how industry deals with chemical substances.  It will make industry and the public more aware of environmental protection and lead to safer handling of chemicals during transportation in and out of our countries.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The transposition of the Seveso II directive included in this Bill is another very important step in modernising our chemical legislation.  This directive and its predecessor are very important and, unfortunately, arise from the carelessness and reckless environmental behaviour of some members of the industry.  The incident at Seveso, where dense vaporous clouds were released from a reactor giving rise to a poisonous and carcinogenic by-product in an uncontrolled reaction, led to untold environmental damage.  Anybody who has read the history of that incident will heartily welcome this new directive being enshrined in legislation.</P>
        <P>We have all read about other incidents such as the accident at a Union Carbide factory in India in 1984.  I well remember reading the reports of the 2,500 deaths, many of them children, and the dreadful vapour from this chemical leak in India.  The survivors of that still live with the untold suffering of poorly controlled industry.  Closer to home contaminated fire-fighting water caused serious pollution of the wonderful Rhine river.  These are two further reminders of how we must never be complacent about what can happen when safety surrounding the use of chemicals is ignored or safety measures in our legislation are insufficient.</P>
        <P>In this context the Seveso II directive is very important in Ireland, particularly on storage of dangerous substances.  I have been contacted by many people in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny about such substances located very near to residential homes and which may be slightly under the threshold for protection by the Seveso directive.  They are worried in case an explosion has a detrimental impact on their homes, particularly in north Kilkenny, where I am dealing with a particular incident.</P><Col N="797"/>
        <P>I note the current review of this area by the European Commission and look forward to reading the report of the study on this directive&rsquo;s effectiveness when it comes out hopefully later this year.  In this area I urge the Minister, perhaps in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to work proactively at European level to further all safety measures to enhance safety here at home and throughout the Union.  Perhaps aspects of this Bill need to be amended, such as higher fines, but anything we can do beyond the directive to further strengthen and enforce safe use and treatment of chemicals in Ireland is to be deeply welcomed.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the Chemicals Bill debate and note that the two main policy objectives of the Bill are to achieve a high level of compliance and minimize the administrative cost to industry.  We should bear this very much in mind.  I thank my colleague, Deputy White, for sharing her time with me.  A Fianna F&aacute;il and a Green Party Deputy sharing time together is proof positive that the coalition is working well.</P>

	<P>I was particularly glad to hear Deputy White mention she was so interested in reading some few years ago when she was clearly quite young.  I must take up a little reading.  I was regaled by Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s contribution and I am sorry the Acting Chairman had to cut him off because he was going very well.  I was going tell him I must check with him and Deputy White about my lost gardening skills.  I had such skills a long time ago but seem to have forgotten them.  I must pick them up again.  I listened to Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s contribution and I was glad to hear him say this is a good piece of legislation and Fine Gael will support it.  It was good that he acknowledged the work of our MEPs.  This week I had the opportunity to meet a number of them when they were home, if they do not mind my using that phrase.  I particularly mention my Dublin colleague Eoin Ryan, MEP, because he has taken a particular interest in this subject.  I look forward to seeing Mr. Ryan in Tallaght this week where he will come out, as he often does, to deal with Lisbon issues and other matters that are of concern to us as we represent, in my case, a major population centre here in Dublin.  As other colleagues have mentioned Tallaght I will not be worried about doing so the odd time.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, who has been particularly helpful to all of us.  I am glad to hear Deputy Durkan also praising his work.  I have raised a number of issues that fall into his remit as Minister with responsibility for labour affairs and he has been particularly generous in his support of the work I am attempting to do.  I do not want to talk too much today about job losses in Tallaght but he has been helpful on that and I appreciate it.  It is right that we acknowledge the clearly effective job he is doing and the work he has done on this Chemicals Bill.  When I recently began to read about the Chemicals Bill, like everybody else, I asked him &mdash; and I am nearly afraid to say this &mdash; what it is all about.  I have listened to most of the contributions today including the Minister&rsquo;s very fine contribution.  Only when one reads such legislation and listens to the debate does one realise, as another speaker said, that this affects us on a daily basis.  Sometimes one thinks it does not.</P>
        <P>It is good that we are down to earth today.  Like everybody else, and I hope this was shared across the benches, I was on a high yesterday having watched television coverage of the events in Washington.  From talking to some people in the United States this morning I know the Taoiseach has done a tremendous service to the country and people have responded in a very positive way to his speech, not only here, as I would expect, but throughout Europe.  Having spoken to some people this morning, including my sister who is on a few days break in Boston, I can tell the House for a fact that it has gone down extremely well.  It is good to acknowledge <Col N="798"/>that and it is good that we are back down to earth today dealing with issues of concern to people here.</P>
        <P>While it may not be possible to say that as we go about our constituencies, whether in Dublin West, Cork, Carlow-Kilkenny, Dublin South-West or Dublin South-Central, people are stopping us to talk about the Chemicals Bill, they are talking to us about issues that are of concern to them.  People often talk about our use of technology and ask if our use of computers and mobile telephones in our daily lives does us any harm.  That may also include the food we eat.  We all like our food and are all careful enough.  I follow a diet since my little health scare some years ago and am always very careful.  Still one wonders whether we will discover in 20 or 30 years that some of the things we do, consume or come into contact with are doing us harm.  The jury may be out for a long time on some of those issues.  In a discussion on this important piece of legislation it is important that we understand and acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>It is important we acknowledge the issuing by the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, and our Taoiseach of the emergency planning literature.  Sometimes people might guffaw about these things but we should understand their importance.  Emergency planning is part of the Minister&rsquo;s remit with regard to this Bill.  As other speakers have acknowledged, this is something to which we need to give attention.  It is only when something horrendous happens that we realise how important these measures are.  I am glad to say I supported the issuing of the emergency planning booklet and I raised the issue on a number of occasions with our colleague, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea.  I am glad the distribution appears to have been effective.  I have seen the booklet in many houses.  Importantly, householders are paying attention to it.  However, Deputy Durkan made the point &mdash; I am not afraid to say this from the Government benches &mdash; that there are still issues that must be dealt with.  People have written to me, for example, about the availability of health services in cases of an emergency.  There are still issues about which people are concerned and it is fair that we raise these.</P>
        <P>The Chemicals Bill, as a number of speakers have pointed out, is drafted in the context of a commitment made under the programme for Government to implement the EU regulatory framework covering the manufacturing and use of chemicals in a way that does not affect the competitiveness of our economy.  It is important that we stress this point, which is relevant in the context of current worries about the economy.  We all saw the report issued by the OECD on Monday in the presence of the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Cowen.  We should remind ourselves of the importance of competitiveness, particularly in the context of this Bill.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to put in place an administrative and enforcement framework for various pieces of EU chemicals legislation.  There are no substantive rules on chemicals, as such, in the Bill because they are contained in the EU regulations which are directly applicable to Ireland.  Reference has been made to some of the measures proposed in the Bill, which include the designation of a number of national authorities, including the Health and Safety Authority, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Health and Children and the Revenue Commissioners, as being responsible for specific areas of enforcement which draw on the most relevant expertise and areas of competence across the system.  Speakers have singled out some of these agencies and there are some, including the Department of Health and Children, that we could talk about all day.</P>
        <P>I wish to mention the important work of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Issues are raised with the EPA on a regular basis.  I have just spent a couple of days in Wexford, where the EPA is based, at a meeting of the British Irish Interparliamentary Body.  I was thinking the other day about the environment, which is something we should all do.  As the Acting Chairman, Deputy Ardagh, knows, because it is quite close to the constituency boundary that he <Col N="799"/>and I share, there are issues in my constituency that I often have cause to raise with the EPA, particularly the operation of the baling station in Ballymount, which is regularly of concern to my constituents in Green Park and the Greenhills area.  I suspect the Acting Chairman also receives calls from the Walkinstown-Crumlin area, which I know well as that is where I come from.  We need to understand that people have such concerns.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, often we do not know whether something is doing us harm and we may not know for quite some time.  Those of us who care about the environment &mdash; that is, nearly all of us &mdash; must understand people&rsquo;s concerns.  The Acting Chairman will also be aware, from his knowledge of the Tallaght region, that there is still an issue with the old landfill site at Bohernabreena, which is now blocked.  As I go about my business &mdash; I try to walk the hills fairly regularly &mdash; people stop me and talk about these issues.  With the national agenda now focusing on the environment, climate change and the dangers to our future and the future of the world, it is important that we are not afraid to raise these issues.  The work of the EPA, as with all other quango-type groups, attracts some critical attention at times.  When I bring my concerns to its attention, I usually get a response.  However, we must remain vigilant and continue to give these matters particular attention.</P>
        <P>I have been spending some time lately going to different schools around my constituency because it is important that politicians engage with young people in their schools.  It is one way of dealing with the cynicism that young people sometimes feel about politics, which I suppose we have all experienced.  I find that when one talks to young people of all ages, they talk about their local environments and the dangers to their communities.  As one reads through this Bill, one sees many provisions to deal with issues that could cause disasters in the future.  I will not repeat what other colleagues, including Deputy White, have said, but we have all experienced shock at disasters involving chemicals that have occurred abroad &mdash; there but for the grace of God we go.  It is important that we are vigilant in this regard.  We must understand that legislation and regulations such as these will be at their most effective, and their true importance will only be seen, if something such as this occurs.  The Minister of State and his officials who worked on this legislation have taken this into account and we should acknowledge this.  The Minister of State has introduced a Bill that is accepted across the floor of the House and that is to his credit.  I wish him well next week and beyond and I ask him to keep my number handy because I look forward to his continued help.</P>
        <P>It is important that we note the range of enforcement powers in the Bill that are aimed at encouraging compliance and discouraging non-compliance, including, I am told, the issuing of directions for improvement plans, the issuing of contravention and prohibition notices and powers to apply to the courts for orders prohibiting certain activities.  I am glad to note the provisions for penalties for offences that are contained in the Bill.  I hope this will make people sit up and take notice.  I am also pleased to note the provisions to make public certain information in the interests of protecting human health and the environment and to protect whistleblowers who report breaches of chemicals law in good faith.  I know my colleague, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, referred to the protection of whistleblowers and we have often discussed this issue in the context of other Bills.  We must continue to encourage such provisions.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill.  I compliment him on his work and thank him for his time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the kind comments of the Deputies opposite and their broad support for the thrust of what we are trying to achieve in the context of ensuring compliance and minimising regulation of the industry.  These are the two purposes of the Bill.  I also thank Deputy O&rsquo;Connor not only for his support of the Bill but also for his kind words about me personally. <Col N="800"/> We will have a discussion about that later.  In the context of the broader debate in society at large about Europe, the Lisbon treaty and the approaching referendum, this Bill is an indication of the positive things that Europe can do.  We must have not only national but also transnational legislation to deal with issues outside the State&rsquo;s control.  This is an example of the positive role the EU can play in people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P>As I have said from time to time at the Council of Ministers, national parliaments and governments take the credit for the positive things that Europe proposes, but if a measure is not popular in a member state Europe is blamed immediately, irrespective of whether it is a European issue.  I acknowledge that point in this context.</P>
        <P>Equally, as Deputy Varadkar and others stated, I acknowledge the role played by our Members of the European Parliament, particularly in discussing and bringing forward a rational and effective regulatory programme in the context of REACH.  Mr. Liam Alyward, MEP, for example, spent long hours discussing REACH and bringing forward a rational proposal in that context.  I also acknowledge the contribution of MEPs from other parties and groupings.  Obviously, this issue was discussed at the Council of Ministers as well.  It goes to show that the European Union works.  It is just another indication of what we are about.</P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar raised a few issues in the context of the legislation.  On the powers of inspectors, the place is defined in the interpretation section of the Bill, section 2.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">&ldquo;place&rdquo; means any structure, premises, land or other location or part of such place, and includes any container, railway wagon, vessel, aircraft, motor or other vehicle;</P>
        <P FLI="0">This Bill has broad support.  We will look at any amendment on its merits and if it improves the legislation and is put forward in that spirit, we would look favourably on those issues.</P>
        <P>The regulatory impact assessment was raised yesterday during Question Time by Deputy English and the Minister responded.  In the context of the Bill, the Minister, Deputy Martin, outlined yesterday the baseline calculation of a 25% reduction.  The measure of the baseline for the implementation of the Chemicals Bill is being done this year and the plan is to repeat this measurement in three years&rsquo; time so that we will have real figures on savings or at the very least that there will be no increase in administrative costs.  We are working on that aspect in this Bill.  Obviously, as a lead Department in reducing regulation on companies, we are conscious of that area.</P>
        <P>The GHS was raised by Deputy Varadkar.  The draft GHS regulation is still being negotiated in Brussels and it is suspected that it will be adopted by the end of this year.  That regulation, when adopted, will be directly applicable.  Like all EU regulations, member states will be required to put in place the enforcement provisions.  The Chemicals Bill, when enacted, will have a ready-made enforcement framework and the legal advice available to me is that the GHS can be enforced under it by means of regulations under the European Communities Act.  I hope that provides clarification.  In any case, we can clarify all of these matters at a later stage.</P>
        <P>Deputy Penrose raised the issue of authorisation.  This will be a process carried out by the European Chemicals Agency in co-operation with the national authorities of member states; the HSA will be the main agency involved in Ireland.  The idea of authorisation recognises that there are some chemicals which, while dangerous, are vital for certain manufacturing processes and authorisation will ensure that they are used safely.  Authorisation may be issued to specific operators who apply &mdash; it will not apply generally.</P>
        <P>Deputies mentioned staffing in the context of the HSA.  I am delighted to state that the Government approved 44 staff for the HSA and an additional two staff for the EPA in June 2005.  The additional EPA staff are in place and 33 of the 44 staff for the HSA are in place. <Col N="801"/> Obviously, the other national authorities will have minor roles under this legislation and will make decisions in the context of budgets available to them for the provision of staff to ensure that there is compliance with the legislation.</P>
        <P>While we are committed to ensuring that there is compliance and that there are staff available to enforce the legislation when it is passed, I have often made the following point to the HSA when I address its board or go to conferences.  The purpose of legislation is to encourage compliance and if compliance is not forthcoming by individuals or by companies, then there is enforcement, prosecutions and heavy penalties.  The primary purpose of legislation is to encourage.  In that regard, we should foster a culture and inculcate in industry that compliance is good for it as well before bringing down the heavy hammer to crack the nut.  I draw attention to the brochure published by the European Chemicals Agency which is a fairly straightforward and self-explanatory flier.  Obviously, the HSA will run seminars informing businesses, such as chemical companies involved in the chemical industry in importing, exporting, transporting or manufacture, that a simplified code of practice will be in place.  The HSA has been positive in all aspects of what it is doing, even with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  They go out to educate and encourage people to comply as opposed to going out to prosecute.  Let us be under no illusions, one cannot have a labour inspector, a health and safety inspector or an inspector in the context of this legislation in every place.  One must hope that industry complies, but knowing full well that in the absence of compliance there will be enforcement and prosecutions.</P>
        <P>I want to inform industry and business on what they will be doing.  The registration of the chemicals under REACH is not only a matter for the chemical industry, but for all industrial and professional users of chemicals.  It is important for manufacturing industry and professional users to contact their suppliers as soon as possible.  I hope that if anybody is listening, other than those inside the Chamber, he or she will engage in this preliminary process on REACH and the pre-registration deadline of 1 December this year to find out if the chemicals with which they are being supplied will be registered.  If one is dependent on a chemical for one&rsquo;s business process and it is not pre-registered, one may be out of business by 1 January 2009.  I say that to everybody, organisations such as IBEC and others involved in representing businesses, so that they will be conscious of this and will engage actively.  The HSA and others will be advising as well, but at the end of the day it is the prerogative of the individuals to ensure that they are up to speed on the legislation and the regulations.  Substances that are not registered under REACH will not be available anymore to downstream users.  Checking with suppliers will give them time look for alternative future suppliers, if necessary.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the Health and Safety Authority has been running information campaigns and I am sure that will continue.  There is a helpdesk as well and I will outline its details so that when people are reading this tonight, or watching &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, they will have all the information.  The REACH helpdesk telephone number is 1980 289 389.  There is a considerable lead-in time and people should engage at an early stage.  There is assistance and co-operation available; seminar and presentation material are also available.</P>
        <P>Let us be under no illusions.  Manufacturing industry is important to the economy, as other speakers relayed also.  While the numbers employed in manufacturing in Ireland have reduced from approximately 15% to 11%, nevertheless, the value to the economy is substantial.  Obviously, the pharmaceutical and chemical area has made a major contribution to high-quality employment in this country.  We are conscious of that and that is why there is a lead-in approach.  In this context there has been plenty of forewarning.  There is pre-registration and everybody should buy into that &mdash; I hope that when the time comes they will have done so.</P><Col N="802"/>
        <P>Much reference was made to whistleblowers.  It is important that we protect those who have made a bona fide complaint about people who may be in breach of this Act.  It is also done in other legislation.  Generally, we should be conscious that a concerned citizen is willing to bring forward a complaint because he or she sees a breach of a particular piece of legislation.  Section 24 will protect people who bring forward a bona fide compliant in the context of a breach of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I again commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to discussing it with the Deputies on Committee Stage.  I thank my officials.</P>

        <Quest> when he last had discussions with the Chinese ambassador; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister met the Chinese ambassador on 16 April regarding the situation in Tibet.  During the meeting, which took place in a sensitive atmosphere, the Minister set out the Government&rsquo;s policy on the situation in Tibet, as well as on our relations with China as a whole.  The Minister also raised the effects on Irish business people and tourists of the introduction of new Chinese visa procedures. </P>
        <P>The Minister deplored the loss of life of both ethnic Han Chinese and Tibetans over the past two months and sought to urge all sides to exercise the maximum restraint, to underline the importance Ireland attaches to the right of freedom of expression and peaceful protest, to urge the Chinese authorities to allow greater access by the media and independent observers to Tibet to allow an assessment of what has been happening there, to establish from the Chinese authorities what has happened to the protesters, seeking assurances of their well-being and the <Col N="803"/>release of imprisoned peaceful protesters, and to encourage dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama.</P>
        <P>The Minister again raised these points with the Chinese ambassador, with a particular emphasis on the importance of dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama.  The Minister made clear his view that dialogue is the only peaceful and sustainable way of ensuring the preservation of Tibetan religious and cultural identity, as well as addressing Chinese concerns regarding its territorial integrity.  In this context, the Government welcomes the announcement last week that the Chinese authorities are to meet in the coming days with representatives of the Dalai Lama.  We hope that these meetings can move quickly to remove any remaining impediments to more substantial talks which could address the issue of autonomy, within the framework of the Chinese constitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It remains the Minister&rsquo;s view that it is through open and frank dialogue, on a bilateral basis as well as through the EU, that we can best impress our concerns on the Chinese authorities.  China remains a key player across a range of important issues, not only relating to human rights and the situation in countries such as Burma and Darfur, but also regarding climate change, sustainable development, trade and investment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is aware that the Chinese ambassador left the Green Party conference when his ministerial colleague made reference to Tibet as a country.  Was this issue raised by the ambassador or the Minister?  If so, what was the view expressed?  Does the Minister of State believe that this incident may have had an impact on Irish and Chinese relations?</P>
        <P>The Chinese have given a commitment that they will reopen talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama.  I understand those talks have not yet begun.  When and where will they begin?  Who will represent the Chinese authorities and who are they prepared to meet from the Tibetan Government in exile?  What is the purpose of the talks?  There is concern among the Tibetan community that once the Olympic Games are over and the world&rsquo;s focus moves away from Tibet that we will be back to square one.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, I acknowledge that the Chinese situation is complex.  There are 1.4 billion people living in China, while Tibet is the size of western Europe and not the size of Wexford or Wicklow.  China has also started to move on the issue of human rights, albeit very slowly.  However, it is important to acknowledge that Chinese people probably feel a bit under siege from the West, and that no matter what stance they take, we seem to be dissatisfied.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I cannot give an opinion on what happened following the statement made by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I will communicate separately with the Deputy on that issue.  The issue in Tibet is very complex and sometimes we form stereotypical views on it in the West, which is not helpful.  I was in China for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and the dearth of information there made it difficult to make any coherent response.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s view that it is imperative that a meaningful dialogue begins and that restraint is shown.  There should be a greater realisation that nothing but good can come from recognising human rights as inviolable, as we hold in the rest of the world.</P>
        <P>In the cultural nature of things, finger wagging by the West towards China is not as helpful as it otherwise might be.  Dialogue is far more likely to produce progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with that, but within certain constraints we may have to take measures available to us if things do not move on.  Can the Minister of State use his good offices to ensure that the international media are let back into Tibet and that those who were <Col N="804"/>arrested following the riots are released?  Does the Government propose to send a representative to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>A final decision has not been taken on the issue of the opening ceremony.  Discussion on this issue in Europe is ongoing, and different views have been taken.  I am pleased that the Deputy focused on this aspect rather than an argument for boycotting the games.  I agree with him that the contacts with China should include issues such as the admission to Tibet of the international media and the condition of those peaceful protestors who were arrested.</P>

        <Quest> the efforts the European Union and Ireland are making to ensure a democratic response to the recent elections that have been held in Zimbabwe; the details of the talks that have been held with the African Union and neighbouring countries of Zimbabwe; and his views on the statements of leaders of civil society that the country stands on the brink of human rights catastrophe. </Quest>
        <QRef>[16868/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is deeply worried about the ongoing situation in Zimbabwe.  We believe that the democratic rights of the Zimbabwean people have been violated by the unacceptable failure to release presidential election results over a month after votes were cast.  We condemn utterly the appalling violence and intimidation against opposition supporters and civil society activists in Zimbabwe, especially in rural areas.  These indefensible attacks represent a catastrophe, not just for those subjected to horrific injuries, but also for the prospects of a secure environment required to finalise the electoral process.</P>
        <P>EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Zimbabwe at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg last Tuesday.  They agreed that the failure to release the presidential election results was unacceptable and insisted that the results, when released, must reflect the will of the Zimbabwean people.  They strongly urged an end to violence and human rights abuses. Ministers expressed support for efforts by the Southern African Development Community and the African Union, and indicated the EU&rsquo;s willingness to put further pressure on Zimbabwe if the situation does not improve.  They noted that the EU does not sell arms to Zimbabwe, and urged a worldwide moratorium on such sales.  Ireland is in full agreement with this approach.</P>
        <P>The EU and Ireland continue to believe that the most effective strategy is to work closely with Zimbabwe&rsquo;s neighbours, who have the greatest potential influence on events on the ground, as well as with regional organisations and the UN.  The Lusaka Summit of the Southern African Development Community on 12 and 13 April urged the quick release of election results in accordance with the law, with verification and counting being witnessed and authenticated by all parties in the election.  The SADC further offered to continue observing the counting process, as well as any second round of voting which may be required.  Improved international monitoring of any run-off election will be vital.</P>

        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>The EU, including High Representative Solana, has been very active on the Zimbabwe issue, making contact with all of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s neighbours in the Southern African Development Community to express our concerns.  Contact has also been made with key figures in the African Union.  Development Commissioner Louis Michel attended the SADC summit in Mauritius on 19 and 20 April, and had a number of contacts with key regional leaders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has also been active on a bilateral basis, using our network of contacts in the southern African region, especially with Irish Aid programme countries, to express our concerns directly. <Col N="805"/> The Taoiseach had an opportunity to raise the issue directly with the Deputy President of South Africa in Dublin on 9 April while the ambassador and officers from our Irish Embassy in Pretoria continue to visit Zimbabwe on a regular basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for his reply.  However, I would like to hear a little more on the conversations with Zimbabwe&rsquo;s neighbours, particularly South Africa.  Is the Irish Government satisfied with the role of the South African Government on the continuing position in Zimbabwe?  What efforts did the Irish Government make to have election observers appointed for the recent elections there?  In respect of elections in that part of Africa &mdash; the Minister of State referred to the South African community &mdash; does he agree that it is in the interests of the region to have election observers appointed at the early stages of elections given that 70% to 80% of election abuses, including fraud, occur in the registration process at the early stages?  These are important issues.  </P>
        <P>My next question concerns the human rights activists who have been arrested in Zimbabwe.  I previously asked a question about whether the president of the Human Rights Commission was free and about the Human Rights Watch report on the arrest and abuse of members of the opposition.  Does the Minister agree &mdash; I would like an explicit answer on this &mdash; that human rights vindication and protection cannot be frustrated by a bogus assertion of the concept of sovereignty?  In other words, human rights abuses in Zimbabwe are not confined to a concern of Robert Mugabe or his Government but are matters of concern for the international community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty in agreeing with the Deputy on that latter point.  Human rights abuses are a matter for us all.  Human rights are not indivisible but are universal and we should have a care for them.  Those of us who have any influence should use it for the vindication of human rights because to trespass on human rights in one part of this planet is to trespass on human rights everywhere.  </P>
        <P>There are, as the Deputy will appreciate, certain practical realities which we must face.  The Deputy asked a specific question about what is our adjudication as to the role played by neighbouring states.  Our adjudication is that those neighbouring states could play a vital and real role.  We believe it is very important to work closely with them and encourage them to be active.  The Deputy who, over the years, has given great attention to matters African and dealing with the post-colonial crisis that reigns across that part of the world will agree that, in a practical sense, finger-wagging by Europeans may not be the best way of dealing with matters in Africa.  However, we must encourage African neighbours and organisations such as SADC to be much more active in this area, to play a real role and to see that it is in their interests and those of their citizens and all humanity that the situation in Zimbabwe is addressed.</P>

	<P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins may ask another supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s broad sympathy with my questions and I agree with his answers.  What is the position of the Government in respect of a run-off election?  Will it send observers?  This is practical.  </P>
        <P>My next question relates to the previous one.  Is the Irish Government concerned at the dispatch of a boat carrying armaments from China to southern Africa?  Does he agree that the refusal of organised workers in South Africa to handle the boat is one of the high moments for democracy in Africa?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  If there was any light in what is a tragedy, it was the extraordinary action taken by South African workers to prevent a boat which should never have taken to the seas to arm this regime.  </P><Col N="806"/>
        <P>There is a practical issue in respect of international observers and observation missions in the case of elections because it very much depends on the agreement of the host country.  Frankly, I cannot see that coming from the Zimbabwean authorities.  That is why I believe it is through SADC and the neighbours that the greatest amount of progress can be made.  The Deputy will probably agree with me on this.  One hopes that they will be more active in that regard.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the funding that has been allocated to the world food programme from Ireland for 2008; the amount allocated in 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[16662/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The United Nations world food programme, WFP, is one of the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian agencies and is dependent entirely on voluntary contributions from donors.  Last year alone, the WFP provided food assistance for 90 million people worldwide.  Ireland is a long-term and committed supporter of the WFP. </P>
        <P>Irish funding for the WFP comes from two sources.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, provides an annual grant towards the core funding of the WFP.  My Department, through Irish Aid, provides assistance to the WFP for specific emergencies.  The total amount provided for WFP in 2007 was over &euro;24.5 million.  To date this year, the overall total Government allocation for the WFP amounts to &euro;20.1 million.  This is composed of &euro;9.9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in core funding and &euro;10.2 million from Irish Aid primarily for a number of humanitarian emergencies, including Chad, Somalia, Sudan, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Zimbabwe and west Africa.</P>
        <P>Irish funding to the WFP has increased rapidly in recent years as that agency has proved itself adept at getting much-needed food relief to those who most need it quickly and effectively.  In 2003, total funding to the WFP amounted to approximately &euro;7.8 million.  This represents a tripling of assistance in five years.  Ireland is now one of the largest donors to the WFP on a per capita basis and this fact has been recognised by the various executive directors of the WFP, who have paid frequent visits to Ireland.</P>
        <P>This year, for the first time, the Irish Aid contribution includes a special grant of &euro;3 million for the WFP&rsquo;s special market mitigation account, which has been established to cover the extraordinary increase in the cost of supplying relief rations, owing to recent food and fuel price increases.  A further element in Irish Aid&rsquo;s contribution is a grant of &euro;1 million to the WFP arising from the Government&rsquo;s rapid response initiative.  The WFP is one of the key partners of Irish Aid&rsquo;s rapid response initiative and this grant covers &euro;600,000 for the construction of a new warehouse facility for its logistics hub for Africa based in Accra, Ghana, as well as &euro;400,000 to enhance the WFP&rsquo;s emergency preparedness capacity.</P>
        <P>In addition to our direct support to the WFP, Ireland provides substantial indirect support to the WFP.  Ireland is a strong supporter of the UN&rsquo;s central emergency response fund, CERF.  This fund ensures that emergency funding is pre-positioned and ready for distribution quickly and effectively to assist those affected by humanitarian emergencies.  Since its inception in 2006, Irish Aid has contributed &euro;52.6 million to this fund, of which the WFP is the largest single recipient.</P><Col N="807"/>
        <P>A second source of our indirect support is by way of the European Union.  The European Commission recently committed &euro;117 million as a response to the impact of the increase in food prices on the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable people.  A substantial portion of this money will go to the WFP.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree that in the region of 1 billion people live on less than $1 per day and that the dramatic increase in food prices has the potential to put another 100 million people in this category?  It is estimated that it will set back by a full decade the policy of trying to bring people out of the poverty trap.  </P>
        <P>The WFP is one of the most worthwhile programmes out there.  I plead with the Minister to consider moving money from some of our programme countries where we cannot find out what happens to much of the money .  For example, Tanzania is to get in the region of &euro;130 million over the next four or five years.  Several Ministers out there are currently under investigation for corruption.  Until such time as we are satisfied that such moneys are being spent the way we want them to be spent, I ask the Minister of State to consider moving money from the normal programme to the WFP.  We give in the region of &euro;20 million between Irish Aid and agriculture, which feeds 19 million people.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that very often if a popular theory takes off, we fail to analyse it?  There is a conflict on this planet between climate change and the production of food.  We cannot have it every way and we need to analyse this.  Most people who express concern about climate change have a cause for concern.  The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, will be familiar with this.  However, very often, the same people are opposed to the concept of GM foods.  We must look at science and technology.  It is not necessary to increase the amount of land under cultivation but we must make it more productive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the small producers in Africa who are the most productive.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come back with a supplementary.  I thank Deputy Higgins for his assistance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I completely agree with Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s praise for the WFP.  I have long been a supporter of it.  Deputy Timmins said that climate change has led to droughts and other climate-related difficulties in major cereal-producing countries such as Australia and Ukraine.  The switch from the production of cereals as foodstuffs to the production of bio-fuels, most notably in the US where a Government subsidy is being used to promote bio-fuel production in a drive for energy security, has led to a reduction in the supply of food.  The current food crisis is caused by a reduction in supply coupled with an increase in demand, which has triggered a steep rise in price.  There is a close link between energy prices and food prices.  I would like to continue to support the World Food Programme.</P>
        <P>The Deputy mentioned Tanzania.  I accompanied the Taoiseach to Tanzania in January and while we were there news of a scandal in the Tanzania Central Bank broke and the director of the bank resigned.  The prime minster and other ministers resigned over it.  The Tanzanian Government is working towards tackling corruption.  I do not know if what the Tanzanian Government has done to address such corruption would happen in many member states of the European Union.  It has taken action, dealt with the bank and with the Ministers who were involved in such corruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister of State.  The problem concerning food price increases is not necessarily on the supply side.  The same level of supply exists but  the demand has diversified from the biofuels sector and there has also been an increase in demand.  I am <Col N="808"/>not saying that the Tanzanian Government is not seeking to address corruption.  I would expect that it would do so.  This is an issue that may be addressed at a later stage on the Order Paper.  I would like money to be moved to the World Food Programme, as it is a worthwhile project.  I ask the Minister of State to consider doing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I can only say that I will support the World Food Programme.  </P>
        <P>I might add that we established a hunger taskforce, which was timely given that we established it before the issue of global food prices arose.  That hunger taskforce has the input of 15 national and international experts.  It was established by the Government to identify what Ireland can do to assist international efforts to reduce hunger.  It has met on three occasions and I hope it will report to me before July.  It will take into account the points the Deputy made.  I do not want to pre-empt its recommendations but it will examine the questions of food price increases and global hunger.</P>
        <P>I would like there to be a green revolution in Africa similar to the one that took place in Asia and that we would support agriculture and ensure there is an increase in food production.</P>

        <Quest> the reason World Trade Organisation talks were taken off the agenda for the recent GAERC meeting; if he had informal discussions with his EU colleagues regarding Ireland&rsquo;s concerns at Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s disregard of his EU mandate; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[16867/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>We would all accept that a fair and balanced outcome from the WTO talks would be universally beneficial.  In recent times there has been intensive activity at ministerial and official level aimed at ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s concerns are brought to the attention of all the key figures in the negotiations. </P>
        <P>WTO negotiations are regularly discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council.  Such a discussion took place on 10 March when the Council briefed Commissioner Mandelson and exchanged views with him on the state of play in the negotiations.  The Council at that time also noted the need for further progress in areas such as services and geographic indications.</P>
        <P>The March Council expressed support for further improvements being sought in the negotiating texts issued last February by the chairmen of the Geneva-based WTO.  It had been expected that the chairmen would issue new texts this month, but there has been slippage in this timetable, for reasons about which we can all speculate and probably know, and the texts were not available.  In the absence of the texts and revised papers or other developments arising from discussions in Geneva, it was agreed that the WTO negotiations would not figure on the agenda of the April meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</P>
        <P>The discussions which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have had with our European colleagues on the WTO negotiations complement the extensive range of efforts the Taoiseach and other Ministers have made with their European counterparts. When the Taoiseach met Commission President Barroso and Chancellor Merkel recently in Dublin, he set out our concerns about the impact an unbalanced WTO agreement would have on Irish and EU agriculture.  These concerns were also raised during the meeting which the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs had with President Barroso in Dublin.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment also raised the issue with President Barroso during his visit to Cork.</P><Col N="809"/>
        <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coughlan, has been extremely active in regularly briefing her ministerial counterparts in other EU member states.  The ongoing WTO negotiations were discussed at some length at the meeting of the Agriculture Council on 14 April.  The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, travelled to Brussels on Tuesday of this week to meet Commissioner Mandelson to again reiterate our concerns.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce, are also engaged in the WTO negotiations.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, has undertaken an intensive series of meetings with key figures in Brussels, Geneva and EU capitals and continues to remain in close contact with his counterparts.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to use every possible opportunity to press home Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and to insist that the negotiations must provide an ambitious agreement, but one that is fair and balanced to all sides.  We will spare no effort in our defence of Ireland&rsquo;s interests, including those in our vital agricultural sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  It is obvious that it was only following the march by 10,000 farmers in Dublin two weeks ago tomorrow that the Government woke up to the problem we face.  This issue not only concerns the farming lobby, but our national interest is at stake, given that we are the fourth largest exporter of beef in the world. </P>
        <P>I wish to put a number of questions to the Minister of State on the talks.  Is he hopeful that the Foreign Ministers can reach an agreement within the EU?  Now that the negotiations are at a crucial stage, what action does the Minister for Foreign Affairs intend to take in regard to Ireland&rsquo;s interests?  That is important.  As the Minister of State said, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, had negotiations with Commissioner Mandelson, but it is obvious he is not for turning.  He issued a very nice press release but there was nothing substantial in it.  The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, also had meetings with her German counterpart.  Are further meetings due to take place with Foreign Ministers and Agriculture Ministers?</P>
        <P>If Commissioner Mandelson proceeds with an agreement that is not in the interests of the Irish Government, it is important that the Minister of State come clean about our position in that event.   The Sinn F&eacute;in President, Gerry Adams, said during a meeting of the Forum on Europe that in the event of the treaty being passed by the Irish people that the Irish Government would not be able to use its veto at the WTO talks.  Perhaps Gerry Adams does not understand the treaty, but the Minister of State needs to tell us in this House this afternoon that in the event of non-agreement, the Government can use its veto.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Deputy for that supplementary because it is critical that the truth be told in the debate in the run-up to the referendum.  The Deputy can take it that the WTO talks and the Lisbon referendum are not in any way connected.  He can also take it that, irrespective of where we are at in our internal referendum, under European law, if and when a decision is made at  the WTO talks, it must come back to and be unanimously agreed in Council.  I am not sure what Mr. Adams said because I was engaged in business in the other House and, unfortunately, could not attend the meeting of the forum.  However, if he made that point, and I have no doubt the Deputy is accurately reflecting what he said, he was not stating the position correctly.</P>
        <P>On the general issue, I met five Commissioners in the past while and we discussed the WTO on each of those occasions.  A week and a half before President Barroso visited this city I happened to be in Brussels for a group of meetings with EU Commissioners and their cabinets and at the same time I met the Irish farming organisations, particularly the IFA.  We had a lengthy discussion and, following a briefing I received there, I went and briefed each of the <Col N="810"/>cabinets and the Commissioners.  It is simply not correct to say that the Government has in any way been indolent or taken its eye off the ball.  We are making contacts at every conceivable level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To return to the Deputy&rsquo;s point, which is an important one and I am pleased he raised it, the Lisbon treaty does not have the effect Mr. Adams attributed to it.  In the event of a different agreement at WTO &mdash; I believe the prospects for agreement at the WTO are not good &mdash; first and foremost it will have to come back to the Council and that is where we must have our influence.  That is where building alliances in Europe will be critically important for Ireland, our agricultural sector and the future of European agriculture.</P>
        <P>As I said, and I believe the Deputy will agree with me, on 13 June after votes are counted, who in this country believes we will be in a better position to negotiate and build alliances if we get a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote?</P>

	<P>Nobody wants the veto to be used, but I take it the Minister of State is confirming we can use our veto in this regard.

I take it the Minister is confirming that Ireland could use its veto if necessary.</P>

	<P>Article 1.56 of the reform treaty inserts a new Article 48 into the Treaty on European Union.  This article has been the subject of some of the most extraordinary distortions during the public debate on the reform treaty.  Any suggestion that the treaty prevents any future referendum on EU issues is a complete misrepresentation.  In fact, a Danish MEP who visited the Forum on Europe and who was the originator of this particular myth admitted that it probably did not apply to Ireland.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The treaty provides for both ordinary and simplified revision procedures.  Under the ordinary revision procedure, the treaty requires that the constitutional requirements of the member state be completed before entry into force of any amendment to the treaties.  This ordinary procedure is essentially the procedure currently provided for amending the existing treaties.  In Ireland, this means, and will continue to mean, that advice will be sought from the Attorney General on each occasion as to the procedures required.  As has always been the case, this could mean ratification by referendum, legislation or a Government decision. There is absolutely no question that a referendum could be ruled out by the Lisbon reform treaty or avoided by the Government.  Those who suggest otherwise are guilty of trying to mislead the public.  In that context, I was very pleased with the clear and unequivocal statement on this issue made by the chairperson of the Referendum Commission earlier this week.</P><Col N="811"/>
        <P>The treaty also provides for simplified revision procedures.  Regarding any European Council decision proposing an amendment to the internal policies of the EU, for example, energy, economic and agriculture policies, the treaty again requires that the constitutional requirements of the member states be completed before any such revision enters into force.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">If the European Council does agree a proposed change, then in order for it to come into effect, it must be ratified by the Member States in accordance with their own constitutional traditions.  This may require a referendum in Ireland as happens at present.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">Regarding any European Council decision proposing a move from unanimity to qualified majority voting in any policy area or an extension of the ordinary legislative procedure &mdash; the so-called <i>passe passerelle</i> provision &mdash; the treaty provides that this is open to a veto from any national parliament, including the D&aacute;il or Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It would require the unanimous agreement of all member state governments, the European Council and the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>No new powers may be conferred via the back door.  These arrangements are open, transparent and give us every opportunity to protect our interests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for clarifying the issue.  Having read the treaty, my understanding is that under Article 1.56, amending Article 48, the ordinary revision procedure must be &ldquo;...ratified by all the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements&rdquo;.  I also understand that under the simplified revision procedures, a decision &ldquo;shall not enter into force until it is approved by the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements&rdquo;.  It is extremely important to place that on the record of the House and that there is absolutely no room for confusion on the matter.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to confirm that this is the situation and that it is not changed by the Lisbon treaty in any sense.  I refer to the Minister of State&rsquo;s assertion that ratification will be by referendum or by Government decision, according to the advice of the Attorney General, and that will continue to be the case under the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to confirm, in the interests of the people of Ireland who will be voting on this issue, that the claim on the website of the Libertas organisation that this will be the last say on Europe for a generation for Irish people is incorrect.  Libertas also claims that there will be no need for the EU ever again to consult the Irish people, although I would respectfully suggest that it is the Government that consults the Irish people and not the EU.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position in that regard.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Minister of State to address the allegation that Article 48 is a devious, self-amending clause that allows the European political elite to avoid the necessity for further referenda.  It is important that the Minister of State clarifies that this is not the case.  It is essential that we, as elected representatives, provide a very clear statement on this for the people of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I note that comments made by the Minister of State on this matter have been distorted by the media.  Press statements have been issued by a certain organisation on the matter and an article by a Member of the European Parliament was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> two days ago.  These are clearly misleading the people and it is important that we clarify matters on the record of the House.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="812"/>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that my understanding of the issue, as well as the Government&rsquo;s legal advice and the advice from almost all sources, is precisely the same as hers.  The suggestion that this is a self-amending treaty and that if the treaty is to be changed in any significant way in the future, the Irish people could simply be ignored is not true.  It is not based on any fact.</P>
        <P>The clearest view on the matter was expressed this week by the chairman of the Referendum Commission.  I hope that during the course of this campaign, the commission, which is now operational, will deal with these issues with the same clarity.  It is simply not the truth to make the assertion that referenda can be avoided in the future.  As an amendment is made, in the normal course, the Attorney General is consulted.   As has happened on this occasion, following that consultation, we will go through the referendum process.</P>
        <P>It is a disservice to political debate for any organisation or political party to distort words to the extent to which they have been distorted.  I welcome the fact that there are other players in the field and that there is a debate.  However, I wish the debate could be kept factual and truthful.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 11, 12, 43, 49, 50 and 98 together.</P>
        <P>I have already outlined in my earlier answer the Government&rsquo;s stance on Zimbabwe.  I reiterate our grave concern about this issue and desire to support all efforts at achieving an outcome to the electoral process which fully accords with democratic principles.</P>
        <P>Regarding the specific issue of election monitoring, Ireland welcomes the willingness expressed by the Southern African Development Community, SADC, at its Lusaka summit last month to provide monitors to observe the counting process until it is complete, as well as to observe any second round of voting which may be required.  In addition to this SADC monitoring, Ireland would support additional credible international monitoring of the election process, to the extent this is possible.  The consent of the Zimbabwean authorities, however, is necessary to make this practicable.  The Irish Ambassador in Pretoria was in Harare for the electoral period, and continues to visit Zimbabwe very frequently.  Indeed, I understand he is travelling there again today.</P>
        <P>I note  that SADC urged the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure that any second round of the presidential election which takes place must do so in a secure environment.  Ireland and the EU have also insisted that there is a need for conditions to improve, including in respect of media freedom and freedom of assembly, and for an end to the climate of violence and repression before any second round of voting.  The EU is encouraging a regional response to the Zimbabwe situation by its neighbours and there is a strong sense of shock and outrage in southern Africa at what has happened in Zimbabwe in the past month.</P>
        <P>I was heartened, in particular, by the strong reaction in the region, including among many ordinary people, against the recent attempt to ship arms to Zimbabwe.  After President Mwanawasa of Zambia, the current chair of the SADC, called on African leaders not to allow the weapons shipment to be delivered to Zimbabwe, the Chinese authorities announced on 24 April that they intended recalling the ship to China.  It should never have left in the first place.</P>
        <P>EU Foreign Ministers noted on 29 April that the EU does not supply or sell arms, related material or equipment which could be used for internal repression in Zimbabwe.  They encouraged others to exercise similar restraint at this time by introducing a <i>de facto </i>moratorium on all such sales .</P>
        <P>We must not overlook the dire humanitarian situation which continues to prevail and worsen in Zimbabwe.  The EU and its member states remain the most important group of donors to Zimbabwe.  Irish Aid support, which helps to alleviate the suffering of the Zimbabwean people, amounted to over &euro;17 million in 2006 and 2007.  It is expected that support in 2008 will reach at least &euro;7.6 million.  This funding is channelled through Irish and international non-governmental organisations, as well as through UN agencies.  The Government fully supports any further action that can be taken in the UN framework to bring positive influence to bear on the situation in Zimbabwe.  Ireland stands ready to respond appropriately to any positive change in Zimbabwe and to assist in an economic recovery programme for that tragic country.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="5" />

      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>President Mbeki of South Africa led a SADC delegation to assist in drafting a new constitution for Zimbabwe, one of the components of which dealt with elections.  It was provided that if there was not an outright winner within 21 days of an election, a run-off would be held.  Does the Minister of State agree what happened in Zimbabwe is a complete sham?  I welcome the decision of neighbouring countries to stand up to the importation of arms but countries in the national liberation movement such as Angola, Mozambique and Namibia, which have Governments that overthrew white rule, have knuckled down together and are giving tacit support to President Mugabe.  Is it time for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to call in the South African ambassador to Ireland to tell him what is happening is not acceptable and <Col N="814"/>South Africa and other countries in the region, with which Ireland has political influence, should move to have the election result announced immediately?</P>
        <P>With respect to the observers, while not underestimating the ability of the election observers from the SADC community, does the Minister of State agree it is important that international observers are permitted?  The Government should take up the cudgels at the UN General Assembly with a view to achieving greater agreement and stronger controls for the conduct of elections across the globe?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The UN declaration on the principles of international election observation and the code of conduct of observers indicates an international election observation mission should only be organised when basic standards have been met, including that the host country issues an invitation or otherwise indicates willingness to accept such missions.  There is a weakness in this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>It needs to be strengthened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The UN principle is that the observation mission is not imposed.  I was an observer at one election but it is practically impossible for external observers to be present without agreement and support from the host government.  This is the tragedy of the Zimbabwean scenario.  That is why SADC should do good work.  Given the tragic relationship between Europe and the African Continent, neighbouring countries could and should, if they have the will, be most useful in this regard.</P>
        <P>SADC&rsquo;s observers have been excellent in some cases and there has been positive commentary on them.  However, the situation is not acceptable and the EU should continue to bring every pressure and subtly &mdash; perhaps they should not be so subtle &mdash; to bear on Zimbabwe&rsquo;s neighbours in order that they realise what is happening is not acceptable.  It is not a question of the Union imposing a view on Africa but we are concerned about the welfare of the people and democracy in the state.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important in trying to unravel the atmosphere that stands at the back of the present position in Zimbabwe to recognise the Lancaster House dimension to it and that the decolonisation act was not fulfilled adequately by Britain.  This is part of the explanation of the origin of violence but it is different from the violence for which President Mugabe is responsible.  While the Minister of State is correct that UN membership is achieved by a sovereign act of joining the body, the most distinguished election observation missions are provided by, for example, the Carter Institute.  The influence on election observation might be useful if the South African Government as a neighbour or SADC as an institution invited the Carter Institute or countries such as Ireland to provide observers.  That would help.</P>
        <P>The Minister may not agree but I am disappointed with South Africa&rsquo;s behaviour in the Zimbabwean electoral process, as I am with SADC&rsquo;s inadequate proposals on governance in southern Africa.  The organisation has gone much further in developing a sophisticated economic model than in addressing governance issues, which are important.  In the discussions with the South African Government and SADC member states and through the EU&rsquo;s relationship with SADC, can issues of governance be discussed beyond and including issues of election observation?  Will observers be offered through the neighbouring countries or the regional institution?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy, as usual, has broadened the debate in a positive way.  I agree the lack of proper governance is one of the tragedies in Africa.  Unfortunately, the Continent is beset by corruption, tribalism and a lack of functioning institutions.  Those dreadful <Col N="815"/>conditions are interrelated and that, tragically, has been the case for the past 50 years.  Colonial powers left an appalling legacy but we cannot continue to blame them for what happened subsequent to independence.  I agree with the Deputy that neighbouring countries have a more vigorous role to play and the debate should move beyond issues of election observation.  It should address how to construct a democracy and a public service that work.  Africa and Zimbabwe, in particular, are not without resources.  They have significant human resources and fine, natural resources and it is a tragedy they cannot be brought to bear.  Democracy and the establishment of a set of institutions that work are necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State correctly mentioned that one of the weaknesses of the UN policy on elections is members must request international observers.  Zimbabwe has signed up to that policy on the conduct of elections.  It is an issue because countries are concerned it may impinge on their sovereignty.  Does the Minister of State agree Ireland can play a lead role in strengthening the policy?  It has been in place since 1990 and more than 100 requests have been made by different countries.  International assistance has been provided at elections on between 300 and 400 occasions.  There should be confidence in these missions.  For example, international observers were present during the 2004 presidential election in America.  There is confidence in the system and Ireland could play a lead role at the UN General Assembly in strengthening that policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>International observers were present in  Wicklow to keep an eye on the Deputy and me last year during the election campaign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not want to mention that because reputations travel far and wide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>If we insist on observation missions elsewhere, we should accept observers.</P>
        <P>The situation is not entirely bleak.  President Mwanawasa of Zambia displayed leadership on the issue of arms, which was a positive step forward.  Previously that was not there.  However, as both Deputies said, it would be very welcome if the neighbouring countries strengthened their activities.  This issue also arises in the context of Burma, which we will address in later questions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8, 9, 29, 35, 44, 46 and 51 together.</P>
        <P>The Government remains deeply concerned by the situation in Tibet.  I have already outlined in my earlier answer the Government&rsquo;s stance on Tibet, which the Minister, through statements and through the Department&rsquo;s ongoing contacts with the Chinese authorities, has sought to address.</P>
        <P>Regarding the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Beijing, no decision has yet been taken regarding Government representation.  However, it remains the Minister&rsquo;s view that open and frank dialogue, both on a bilateral basis, as well as through the EU, rather than a boycott of the games, remains the best and most productive manner of engaging China on issues relating to human rights.</P>
        <P>Ireland, with our EU partners, has stressed the importance of dialogue between Chinese authorities and representatives of the Dalai Lama.  The Minister welcomes last week&rsquo;s announcement on the resumption of such talks.  We hope that both sides will use this opportunity to seek a sustainable solution addressing the protection of Tibetan religious and cultural identity within China.</P>
        <P>The Minister addressed these points directly with the Chinese ambassador during a meeting with him on 16 April, noting the considerable concern among the Irish public on this issue.  He also met with representatives of the Tibet Support Group &mdash; Ireland on 1 April to discuss with them their concerns regarding the current situation, and how these might be addressed.  On 28 April 2008, senior officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs met with Mrs Kesang Takla, a representative of the Dalai Lama.  Depending on his schedule, the Minister would also be willing to meet with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, should he visit Ireland, in his capacity as a revered international spiritual leader.</P>
        <P>On the wider issue of human rights in China, the Government continues to take these issues very seriously.  Our concerns are raised on a regular basis in bilateral contacts with the Government of China, and the Department of Foreign Affairs has remained in regular contact with <Col N="817"/>the Chinese Embassy in Dublin in recent weeks over the situation in Tibet.  Discussions in this regard take place at official level in Dublin and in Beijing.  In these discussions we continue to raise issues regarding the religious practice, freedom of expression and the preservation of the cultural identity of Tibet.</P>
        <P>The role of China in regard to international issues such as Burma and Darfur is also regularly raised in bilateral contacts. In this regard, the Minister recognises and welcomes the efforts China has made to encourage greater co-operation from the Governments of Sudan and Burma with the international community in seeking to resolve the very serious human rights and humanitarian situations in both countries.</P>
        <P>We continue to urge ongoing and intensified engagement by China on these issues which also form part of the regular dialogue between the EU and China, particularly through the biannual human rights dialogue, the next round of which will take place on 15 May 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree that if the Chinese authorities entered into meaningful dialogue with the Tibetan representatives and with a clear indication of the direction of such talks and a clear remit, it would certainly assist the Government in coming to a decision whether it would attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct that it would be very helpful to the entire international community.  I visited China recently and I know the extraordinary importance which the ordinary Chinese, let alone the Chinese official and government agencies, attach to the Beijing Olympic Games and to the Olympic events taking place in other parts of China.  There is a real excitement on the streets and it is a tragedy that these issues cannot be resolved.  It would be good if there was proper dialogue and it would be in everybody&rsquo;s interests, not least China&rsquo;s own, if there was a dialogue and more openness.</P>
        <P>There was a complete lack of awareness in the West to what was in Tibet because nobody could look in.  As we know in the first few tragic days of the events in Lhasa, it was Han Chinese who were slaughtered and put to death in some gruesome ways.  It is in nobody&rsquo;s interests to have such a closed situation.  The cultural reality is different from the cultural reality in this country.  If we know anything on this island we know that all conflict is ultimately brought to resolution through discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Some years ago I visited Beijing and Lhasa with other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Does the Minister of State agree that great caution needs to be taken about accepting news of the Han deaths that have been reported from Tibet?</P>
        <P>It is a complex issue but will the Minister of State agree that in terms of international law what is taking place in Tibet is the consequence of an occupation?  There has been a forced migration into Tibet, an arrival of Han people into Lhasa who have more or less monopolised the commercial sector.  There has been interference with people in the monasteries and suppression of religious freedom.  Apart from the issue of the one China policy, there are issues of basic human rights with respect to religious expression, freedom of speech, access to the outside community and the right of the international community to be present in Lhasa.</P>
        <P>Desmond O&rsquo;Malley, a former Member of the House, accompanied us to Beijing where we asked questions about disappearances.  The former Minister, David Andrews, accompanied me further on to Lhasa, where we did not get satisfactory answers on all issues.  We got satisfactory answers to some questions, but the majority of our questions were not satisfactorily answered, particularly those relating to disappearances, arrests and punishment.</P>
        <P>There seems to be consensus on the value of talks.  I would make two comments about that.  Such talks must be at a meaningful level, rather than at a low level and must include the end <Col N="818"/>prospect of a direct discussion involving His Holiness the Dalai Lama.  My second comment relates to the EU-China dialogue, which takes place on 15 May.  It is important that significant progress is made at that if we are to have the fruitful results of dialogue that might bring peace in both places.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that dialogue must move beyond the <i>pro forma.</i>  I also agree that reports of what is or is not happening in Tibet are by their nature, because there is no international observance, ones in which one cannot place much credibility.  This is a tragedy and it is not in China&rsquo;s interest that this should continue to be the case.  As the Deputy said, there were disputes as to who did what and when, particularly with regard to the deaths of the Han Chinese.  The death of any individual is unacceptable.  There must be restraint on both sides and an absolute rejection of violence.</P>
        <P>I find it very interesting that if people were to listen more closely to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, they would find he has been very measured in his comments.  He stresses, for example, that it is important to find a resolution for Tibet within the one China policy and he seeks dialogue with the Chinese people.  He has made it clear that he seeks genuine autonomy for Tibetans within the framework of the Chinese constitution.  There is great measure in those comments.</P>
        <P>When we first began to get wind of the violence, death and destruction, the Dalai Lama made it clear that he too believed there was nothing to be achieved by violence.  Would one expect anything less from someone of his standing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the issue of Tibet raised at the GAERC meeting, because as far as I recall it was not on the official agenda, which is somewhat strange?  Without trying to undermine the potential influence of the Government, I do not see discussions at member state level as particularly useful.  However, discussions at EU level could be very useful in terms of extending and exerting political influence on China.</P>
        <P>While I have major concerns about abuses of human rights, democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of religious practice etc., there are two sides to the issue.  It is very easy to jump on a particular bandwagon which may be populist or popular or follow a media-driven agenda.  I would not like to see that happen and would certainly not like to see it impact on a sporting event.  I have a strong view that sports and politics should be kept separate.  In fairness to the athletes who have been preparing for the Olympics and who will travel to Beijing, they should have their rights respected so that their hard work over the past number of years is not undermined by this controversy.  At the same time, we must try to ensure that we can exercise some political influence over China.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I take all the points the Deputy makes.  With regard to the General Affairs and External Relations Council, as the Deputy knows, I was engaged on the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill in this House and did not attend.  A wide-ranging discussion always takes place on the issues of the moment and I have no doubt that was done.  I agree that while individual hand-wringing may make us feel better, effective negotiations, particularly through Europe, can be extremely good.  While China has great respect and regard for Ireland, the reality is that it has respect and regard for 27 member states.  This is the point that Deputy Creighton and I have been making inside and outside the House, which is that, through the European Union, we can amplify the concerns of the Irish people best on issues such as abuses of human rights, whether in Zimbabwe or Tibet, which also experiences problems.  The EU is engaged in this on an ongoing basis.</P>

        <Quest> the position in relation to the discussions taking place on reform of the United Nations; and the progress being made in such discussions. </Quest>
        <QRef>[16847/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The UN World Summit held in September 2005 agreed a package of UN reforms which, while not as complete as might have been hoped, represented an important advance.  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, contributed to the summit outcome in his role as one of the five special envoys appointed by former Secretary General Annan to support his recommendations for change aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the UN.  Work to implement these reforms has been proceeding since then on a number of levels.</P>
        <P>During the current session of the UN General Assembly, Ireland and Tanzania are leading the effort to reform the United Nations development architecture through the implementation of the recommendations of the high level panel on system-wide coherence.  The panel reported in late 2006 and its proposals mainly centre on the development of a unified UN presence at country level, with one leader, one programme, one budget and a single office.  As the only Member of this House who worked within the UN as a human rights fellow in 1978, I have found, since I became Minister of State, that the institution has not changed a lot and certainly in this area reform is required.</P>
        <P>The core objective of these reforms is to improve the delivery of aid by the UN in developing countries.  Since the publication of the panel report, pilot programmes have been established in eight countries, including in three Irish Aid priority countries, namely, Vietnam, Tanzania and Mozambique.</P>
        <P>The Irish Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York, Ambassador Paul Kavanagh, was appointed by the President of the UN General Assembly to co-chair, with his Tanzanian colleague, the process of consideration and implementation of the panel recommendations within the General Assembly.</P>
        <P>More broadly on the reform agenda, discussions are continuing on the important issues of management reform and reform of the Security Council.  Ireland has actively supported the continuing efforts to bring about improvements in the management of the UN, and improvements could certainly be effected.  However, despite progress in a number of areas, there remains much more to be done.  The President of the General Assembly recently highlighted the need to focus on three areas in particular the way mandates are formulated, implemented and evaluated; planning and budgetary processes; and human resource management.</P>
        <P>As regards reform of the Security Council, Ireland&rsquo;s view is that a more representative, efficient and transparent Security Council is an essential aspect of reforming the UN to meet the many global challenges which we face.  We welcome and support the current efforts of the president of the General Assembly to reinvigorate the debate.  Following an open meeting on this issue on 10 April, he and his task force, comprising the permanent representatives of Bangladesh, Chile, Djibouti and Portugal, have initiated consultations with member states to take the process of Security Council reform forward.  Following consultations, he intends to convene another meeting on this matter before presenting recommendations to the General Assembly before the end of this current session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I have respect for the Minister of State so he will excuse my stating that the reply conveys a disastrous failure with regard to United Nations reform.  Drawing on his previous experience, he will recall no doubt that in 1981 the late and distinguished Erskine Childers and Brian Urquhart produced two excellent volumes on reform of the United Nations.  It is interesting to note that those proposals 27 years ago were far more advanced <Col N="820"/>than anything which came out of the consultation, with respect to the group of five and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Ahern.</P>
        <P>Specific proposals were made for reform to the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.  Where do they stand?  Thinking about the rationalisation of the United Nations offices, it seems the net effect of this was to withdraw United Nations people from the field and have a greater ratio of people in headquarters.  They were taken back from the point of contact.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  With regard to development co-operation, it is not only that Ireland seeks a more representative Security Council within the UN.  I suspect the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, may be better informed than most with regard to my next comment.  The domination by the permanent members of the Security Council of a number of key posts, such as the offices of the UNDP, means they are effectively in the grip of certain countries.  I could give several other examples.  Who is responsible for human rights within the Government?  To which Ministry has it been allocated?  How are appointments made to the United Nations agencies?  Are they advertised publically from the office in New York, as they are supposed to be?  How do graduates in Ireland apply?  Are they confined whereby vacancies which arise in the UN and its agencies are displayed in a limited sense here, perhaps within a Department?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the general point the Deputy makes.  I have taken a personal interest in the United Nations over many years and there can be no doubt whatsoever that if there was ever a body that needed reform, the UN is it.  I also tend to agree with the Deputy on the issue of appointments.  The permanent members have a disproportionate influence.  I well remember that in 1978, when I was a human rights fellow in the United Nations, the person to whom I answered was a formidable Russian lady and her major concern with regard to my activities was that I made expenses claims at the appropriate high level.  I do not believe that has changed.</P>
        <P>There are many reasons to be cynical about the United Nations but we do not want to damage what is there.</P>

	<P>Deputy Higgins above all does not want to damage, nor do I, the only hope the world has.

I will return to the Deputy on other specific points in writing.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 99 together.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has overall responsibility for the independent audit of all Government expenditure, including the Irish Aid budget.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported on the appropriation accounts for Vote 29 for the period 2002 to 2006.  The 2007 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be published in due course.</P>
        <P>The Secretary General of my Department met the Committee of Public Accounts in his capacity as Accounting Officer on 10 April, when the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Vote for international co-operation was discussed.  No significant issues were raised in the report.</P>
        <P>The evaluation and audit unit conducts a range of audits as part of its overall work programme.  Some of the audits are carried out directly by the unit, while others are carried out by professional auditing companies commissioned by Irish Aid.  We also obtain audit assurance from work carried by our internal auditors based at missions in programme countries, joint donor funded audits of specific programmes, such as the health sector in Mozambique, where Ireland jointly funds an audit with Canada, Denmark and Switzerland and audit reports obtained from partner organisations, such as those carried out by national audit offices in programme countries, international organisations and NGOs.</P>
        <P>Internal audit is a key element of the governance arrangements for the aid programme.  In discharging this function, the evaluation and audit unit operates in a confidential manner in order to ensure its ability to operate effectively is not inhibited in any way.  It is not, therefore, our practice to publish internal audit reports, but they are available to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the audit committee.  This approach facilitates Irish Aid in its efforts to strengthen internal controls and oversight systems in partner organisations, which, in turn, enhances the management and overall effectiveness of the aid programme.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid remains fully committed to transparency and, in this regard, publishes many key reports.  These include the annual report of the audit committee, value for money reviews, major programme evaluations and other policy documents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael strongly supports the Irish Aid programme.  However, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that we obtain value for money.  As I pointed out at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Sub-Committee on Overseas Development, at which Mr. Niall Mellon delivered a presentation, I have concerns in this regard not because of what I know, but because of what I do not know.  Not only public representatives but also the public should be able to access information on the precise amount allocated to a particular country and how it was spent.</P>
        <P>The Minister observed that the Comptroller and Auditor General has access to the audit reports but cannot release them for reasons of confidentiality or sensitivity.  However, in the case of public moneys, the public is entitled to know how they are spent.  It is an issue my party has raised before.  I understand a freedom of information request submitted by a national newspaper in respect of these reports was rejected.  I will continue to highlight this issue until we obtain access to the reports.  I want to be able to say to my party colleagues and those I represent that I am satisfied the money is reaching those for whom it is intended.  If that means presenting the reports, warts and all, so be it.  It would be a failure on my behalf and on behalf <Col N="822"/>of my party if we did not pursue this issue.  This is not to take from our strong support for the allocation of moneys to Irish Aid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It would help to resolve this issue if we could move beyond the parameters of strictly financial audit.  I accept there may be circumstances where there is another client apart from the State.  In such cases, it is appropriate that there be restrictions.  What might be required is an implementation group that includes the financial audit.  In place of relying on the annual report of the audit committee and similar reports, it would be better to have an implementation group that would look at how allocations work.  The terms of reference of this group should go beyond the financial to the evaluation of such questions as whether a programme achieved its social goals, was inclusive, helped governance and was diffuse in the way it worked.  Such a body could be brought into existence easily.   Will the Minister of State consider setting up such a mechanism?</P>
        <P>The advice provided to the Minister by the development aid advisory committee is not published.  I would welcome a decision of the committee to publish that advice.  Let us have the information so that we can all support the Irish Aid programme.</P>
        <P>At yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Sub-Committee on Overseas Development, there was strong support for the idea of Irish Aid funding internships.  This would mean that development aid workers, rather than having to seek out practical experience after qualification, would be able to avail of that experience, under the guidance of Irish Aid staff, as part of their regular training.  In that way, one could combine macro and micro awareness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>We are in line with international norms where the practice is that internal audits are not published but are made available to the supreme audit institution in the state in question.  In principle, we could publish these internal audits if our capacity to get our work done were not undermined as a result.  However, if the trust we have built with individuals and organisations were undermined through the publication of confidential details, our levels of access could be diminished.  Deputies are aware that we do not provide aid to such countries as Zimbabwe and Sudan.</P>
        <P>At a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledged the justification for not publishing the audit reports.  He made the point that for such reports to be effective, they must not pull punches and must state the position as it is.  This may mean that individuals referred to in the report are identifiable, which could cause problems if the reports enter the public domain.  The Comptroller and Auditor General observed that an awareness that a report is to be published might result in less frank reports, which is not in the long-term interest.  He remarked that the internal audit reports are available to his office and to the independent audit committee that operates in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Comptroller and Auditor General further advised that if a matter requiring public accountability came to his attention, he would not be averse to reporting it to the committee.</P>

	<P>I am not raising this issue to be provocative or to seek somebody&rsquo;s head.  Rather, I put down this Adjournment matter with a sense of desperation.  I have a personal interest in this issue.  Some years ago, having sought a particular file on behalf of a constituent, I was told that such files were the property of the then Southern Health Board and could not be viewed by the individual concerned.  The constituent accepted this response but it seemed to me a peculiar situation.  In 2006, another constituent sought information contained in a particular file only to be told that the file had been destroyed.  On 18 December 2006, I put down a question to the Minister on the disposal of files and received a comprehensive and reassuring answer.  However, today&rsquo;s development is startling on several fronts.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Michael P. Kitt, can answer my questions and, if not, that the Department will get back to me as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>It seems the files that have been uncovered are the very ones which could not be discovered by those women who sought them in reference to the hepatitis C and anti-D debacle.  Most of those files were from the 1970s and 1980s, with a small number from the early 1990s.  Some of the women who could not prove that the anti-D immunoglobulin they received was contaminated were those whose files had been destroyed or had gone missing.  Many files were still available and had been micro-filmed.  I do not want to engage in scare tactics and heighten people&rsquo;s fears.  However, the relationship between patients and doctors is considered sacrosanct.  Patients may not have told their families about conditions for which they are receiving treatment.  Even if they had, they most definitely did not want the wider public to know about them.  We have all been in this position.</P>
        <P>If it is the case that files were unearthed, I want to know who was responsible, how this happened and whether it could happen again.  Has the HSE laid claim to these files and taken repossession of them?  Will the HSE contact the people involved, let them know what happened and reassure them this will not happen again?  We must have confidence in our health service.  I accept that this is the last thing the HSE needs at the moment.  However, we must obtain reassurance these files are back in the possession of the HSE, that they will be secured this time and that, if they should be destroyed, this will be done.</P>
        <P>Will an investigation be undertaken to determine if some of the files unearthed and rediscovered are those sought by women in respect of hepatitis C?  If so, will they now be made available?  The public must be reassured their private and confidential details held by the HSE are protected and that if they are to be destroyed in the future they will be microfilmed, <Col N="824"/>shredded or incinerated.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline how we are to provide this reassurance to those people who must now be seriously worried.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank Deputy Lynch for raising this issue.</P>
        <P>The HSE has confirmed that it was notified yesterday that patient records from the former Cork Regional Hospital, now Cork University Hospital, and St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital had been found in a disused landfill site in Glounthane, County Cork.  I understand that the HSE responded immediately to the situation and is undertaking a full investigation to establish how these files came to be disposed of in this inappropriate manner.</P>
        <P>The initial inspection indicates that the records date back to before 1983.  The discovery was made when part of the landfill previously licensed by Cork County Council adjacent to a railway line was excavated as part of preparatory works for the reopening of the east Cork railway line.  As soon as the HSE was notified, the information was treated with the utmost urgency and hospital staff attended the site to assess the situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand the HSE is working in co-operation with the construction company and with Cork County Council.  A meeting between the HSE and Cork County Council will take place on the site today.  HSE security staff have been deployed to the site as nothing can be removed until inspected by Cork County Council&rsquo;s waste enforcement officer.  The HSE has reported the matter to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In addition, it has established a lo-call information line to deal with public inquiries about this matter.</P>
        <P>HSE south has advised that since the mid-1980s hospital records are stored indefinitely and that prior to this certain inactive hospital records would have been sent for microfilming and for appropriate disposal.  Hospital records have, since 1993, been confidentially archived and stored by a professional data storage company.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE continues to make progress in respect of the appropriate management of patient records.  Its National Hospitals Office, NHO, launched its code of practice for health care records management in May 2007.  The code outlines the framework for best practice in ensuring consistent, coherent health care record management in all public and private health care facilities throughout the country.  In addition, it sets out the schedules for retention and disposal of health care records in publicly funded acute hospitals in the national hospitals office.  The code lists the minimum retention periods for health care records in the NHO and provides a clear policy in order that hospitals can operate a health care records retention and disposal practice in a consistent manner across the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The HSE is committed to ensuring that this code of practice is adopted and adhered to nationally and has developed a staff training programme which is being rolled out during 2008.  I hope this will information will alleviate the concern being experienced by members of the public.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this item for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>On 24 January 2006, the expert group on mental health policy established by the Department of Health and Children published a new national mental health policy framework entitled, A Vision for Change.  This was subsequently adopted by Government and the Health Service Executive.  It proposed significant changes and improvements in mental health services and <Col N="825"/>a true movement of services into the community.  It made important recommendations on empowerment, advocacy, peer support, offering a range of therapies, supporting carers and, perhaps most important, recovery from mental illness.</P>
        <P>I would like to quote from the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s 2008 evaluation in this regard.</P>
        <P LI="1">Regrettably, since the launch of <i>A Vision for Change</i>, there has been little action in its implementation.  Two years later, mental health service users and providers are still struggling with an outdated, fragmented and severely under-resourced system.  Mental health and related services remain amongst the most neglected areas of Government policy and provision, leading to multiple infringements of human rights of people with or at risk of mental health problems.  There remains a widespread unavailability of psychological and social interventions as complements to medication, denying the right to the most appropriate and least restrictive or intrusive treatment.  Ireland still has a high rate of hospitalisation for mental health problems, due to limited community-based services, conflicting with the right to treatment in the least restrictive environment.  Specialist mental health services, such as services for people with eating disorders or brain injuries, remain generally unavailable outside of Dublin, while access within Dublin remains limited.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In her annual report of 2006, the Inspector of Mental Health Services found mental health provision to be <i>ad hoc </i> in nature, with serious deficiencies in community mental health teams around the country and no teams in mental health services for people with intellectual disability.  Basic staffing is unavailable for children&rsquo;s mental health services throughout the country and, waiting lists for children&rsquo;s services remain lengthy.  In 2006, 3,000 children and adolescents waited an average of 15 months for assessment and some families waited as long as four years in this regard.  In 2007, waiting lists were even longer with 3,598 children waiting for assessment, one third of whom waited more than 12 months.</P>
        <P>The reality within mental health services today is that A Vision for Change has not marked a turning point in Government attention to this neglect.  While it is the stated aim of the HSE to move to a coherent, transparent and equitable resource allocation model, current funding for mental health services remains inadequate and inequitable.  A Vision for Change is explicit that a minimum of an additional &euro;25 million is required annually for a six year period to allow implementation of the mental health service expansion and improvement objectives.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I received several letters from the HSE in response to parliamentary questions requesting information regarding the &euro;25 million allocation.  I was informed on several occasions that &euro;25 million had been allocated to this area in 2006 and 2007.  However, on 9 January 2008, the HSE in response to a freedom of information request from the Mental Health Alliance stated that 57% of the developments funded in 2006 had been put in place at an annual cost of &euro;17 million and 40% or &euro;10 million of the funding provided in 2007 had been put in place.  Of the &euro;51 million we were told had been allocated, only &euro;27 million was spent implementing changes.  The HSE response stated that the balance of the funding from 2006 and 2007 had been time delayed to address core deficits in existing mental health services thus ensuring that the HSE met its obligations to deliver services within the Vote.  This response makes it abundantly clear that almost half of the funding allocated for implementation of A Vision for Change has been spent in other areas.</P>
        <P>Not one extra shilling has been provided in 2008 towards implementation of the recommendations contained in A Vision for Change.  The funding has been cut and A Vision for Change has been abandoned by Government.  The commitment to provide &euro;25 million annually for a six year period was never met.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and I thank Deputy Neville for raising it.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy, which was launched in January 2006, contains some 200 recommendations.  The report has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of mental health services.  The estimated additional cost of implementing the recommendations of the report is &euro;150 million over a seven to ten year timeframe.  A total of &euro;51.2 million has been allocated since 2006 for the development of mental health services in line with the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>That is spent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>However, implementation of A Vision for Change is dependent to a much greater extent on the remodelling of existing resources than on new additional funding.  Additional investment must be phased in parallel with the reorganisation of mental health services and resources.</P>
        <P>In the context of ever-rising demands for health resources, mental health expenditure should be closely monitored to ensure services demonstrate both effectiveness and efficiency.  Before any further additional funding is provided it is essential that the HSE is in a position to demonstrate that money allocated for mental health services is efficiently used and that the substantial changes in the organisation and delivery of mental health services envisaged in A Vision for Change are progressed.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive is obliged to operate within its overall Vote.  It took steps to meet this objective in 2007 by delaying some of its planned developments, including developments in mental health services.  Some of these developments will proceed in 2008.  These include the provision of eight additional consultant child psychiatry teams; the provision of 18 additional beds for children and adolescents at St. Anne&rsquo;s, Galway, St. Vincent&rsquo;s, Fairview and St. Stephen&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork, to increase the bed complement from the current provision of 12 to 30 during 2008; and the construction of two 20 bed units for children and adolescents in Cork and Galway.  Construction on these units is expected to commence in 2008 and be completed in 2009.</P>
        <P>An independent monitoring group was established to monitor and assess progress in implementing the recommendations set out in A Vision for Change.  The monitoring group&rsquo;s first annual report was published in May 2007.  The report acknowledges the progress made but expressed concern about the lack of a systematic approach to implementation of the report and the lack of clarity in responsibility for implementation in the HSE.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decision to establish the Office for Disability and Mental Health reflects its commitment to developing a more coherent and integrated response to the needs of people with disabilities and mental health problems.  The office will support the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and mental health and facilitate cross-agency and cross-departmental work and deliver real benefits to clients and service users into the future.  It will bring a new impetus to the implementation of A Vision for Change working in partnership with the HSE and other stakeholders to achieve implementation of agreed targets.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive recently approved its implementation plan which sets out six key priorities for 2008 and 2009.  Following concerns raised by the Office for Disability and Mental Health regarding the need for a longer-term focus, the HSE has undertaken to prepare a more comprehensive plan before the end of this year.</P><Col N="827"/>

      <sTitle>Controlled Substances.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue I raise concerns patients receiving the best medical treatment that is available, arising out of research, on controlled drugs and drugs that are not subject to regulation.  In reply to a parliamentary question from me on 17 April the Minister said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of . . . substances . . . where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.</P>
        <P LI="1">The current legal position in Ireland in relation to cannabis is that it is a scheduled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and its sale, supply, distribution and possession is unlawful except for the purpose of research.  My Department is aware that claims have been made in respect of cannabis and its possible benefits for patients suffering from certain conditions such as multiple sclerosis and glaucoma.  As the law currently stands, however, cannabis is not licensed here for medicinal use.  I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy...</P>
        <P FLI="0">While certain controlled substances are available to pharmacists as the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and practitioners indicate, it is not legal for them to prescribe them.  Pharmacies can have them on their premises for the purposes of the profession or business, nevertheless neither pharmacists nor medical practitioners can prescribe them.  Therefore, it is difficult to see what is their purpose.  The law only allows them to be used for research.  What happens when that research is completed?  Has any research taken place and, if so, what are the findings of that research?  What have the medical practitioners and pharmacists, who are licensed to operate under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, done with the research they have produced?</P>
        <P>There are a number of Irish citizens abroad who are ill with various diseases, for example, multiple sclerosis.  They have been prescribed a certain controlled drug in other countries &mdash; it is legal to prescribe these drugs in many European countries and in a number of states in the US.  Yet there is no way these citizens of Ireland can continue that prescription in Ireland.  Effectively, in a number of cases, these people are prohibited from dwelling in Ireland if they are to receive what is considered to be the best medial treatment for them.  That is the crux of the situation.</P>
        <P>If there is an existing controlled drug that is an integral part of medical treatment, it is time Ireland looked at that.  For example, morphine is opiate based.  There has been no problem with prescribing morphine for seriously ill patients.  Morphine is an opiate and is produced from opium.  It was not considered to be a serious problem until such time as heroin ravaged this country in the late 1970s.  Morphine would not be allowed to be used in any form in medical treatment had we known about the devastation heroin would cause over the past 30 years.  Are we afraid to examine the medical properties of certain controlled drugs at this time just because drugs in general have a bad name?</P>
        <P>On 17 April 2008, in the US Congress, legislation was introduced to provide for the medical use of marijuana in accordance with the laws of the various states.  That arose out of the American Association of Pharmacists coming to a conclusion that because of its proven efficacy at treating certain symptoms and its relatively low toxicity patients should have access to this type of treatment.</P>
        <P>I want to tease out the issue.  Essentially the matter came to my attention because a particular Irish citizen who has a serious medical illness applied on more than one occasion to return to Ireland and visit his home, from which he has been absent for some time, but because part of <Col N="828"/>his treatment comes from controlled substances that are not available for medical treatment here, he is unable to visit his native country.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate whether Irish research findings support the conclusions of international research which indicate that specific controlled substances offer considerable health benefits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank Deputy for raising the matter, which I understand refers to the availability of medicinal cannabis for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.</P>
        <P>The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.  Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under international conventions or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Cannabis is a Schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  This means that its sale, supply, distribution and possession is unlawful except for the purpose of research.  All Schedule 1 substances are substances which are considered as having no medicinal use and, accordingly, cannabis cannot be prescribed or dispensed in Ireland for medicinal use.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children is aware that claims have been made in respect of cannabis and its possible benefits for patients suffering from certain conditions such as multiple sclerosis and glaucoma.  However, as the law currently stands, it is not possible for a cannabis extract to be licensed in Ireland for medicinal use or for a general practitioner to prescribe it.  No exemptions or exceptions are applicable and the Minister for Health and Children does not intend to change the law in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children and Health Service Executive are participating in the steering group on the development of the National Drugs Strategy 2009 to 2016 established by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  This will involve a review of the operation of current drug treatment services and development of services in the future.  The Department of Health and Children will this year review and update the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 2006 to consider modernising this legislation and the regulation of controlled drugs in general.  I thank the Deputy again for raising this issue.</P>

        <Quest> the situation in Kenya at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The political and humanitarian situation in Kenya has continued to improve, following the peace deal signed between the government and opposition on 28 February 2008. Under the deal, a coalition government has been established and a new post of Prime Minister created, to which Mr. Raila Odinga, the leader of the Orange Democratic Movement, has been appointed. Agreement has also been reached between the two sides on the formation of a new cabinet, which was formally sworn in on 17 April 2008.</P>
        <P>Minister Ahern visited Kenya from 23-24 April 2008 in order to demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s support for the reconciliation and reconstruction efforts underway in Kenya. During his visit, which was the first by a senior EU figure since the new cabinet was sworn in, he met with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Local Government, the Foreign Minister, and the Minister for Tourism. The Minister also met with Irish and international NGOs working in Kenya, including GOAL, Concern and Trocaire, and visited a number of camps for internally displaced persons in the Rift Valley region, which suffered particularly during the post-election violence. The Minister&rsquo;s main message to all interlocutors was the need for all sides to work together to ensure that the ethnic violence and bloodshed that occurred in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections does not re-occur.</P>
        <P>The Minister also urged the need to address the more long-term issues, such as constitutional reform, land tenure, and corruption, which contributed to the recent crisis. In this regard, full implementation of the 28 February agreement will now be critical, including establishment of Commissions on Truth, Justice and Reconciliation, and Constitutional Reform, which are provided for under the agreement brokered by Kofi Annan. In response to a request from the UN, Ireland was pleased to provide &euro;100,000 in financial support to the Annan mediation talks.</P><Col N="830"/>
        <P>Since the post-election violence, which resulted in an estimated 1,500 deaths and upwards of 600,000 people being displaced, the humanitarian situation in Kenya has improved considerably, with many of those displaced returning to their homes. However, creating the conditions in which all remaining displaced persons will feel confident enough to return home will be a major challenge.</P>
        <P>Ireland, for its part, remains a significant humanitarian donor to Kenya, and has committed a total of over &euro;27 million to Kenya since 2006. None of this aid is channelled through the Kenyan Government. This Irish Aid funding includes over &euro;7 million in humanitarian relief for Kenya in response to emergency appeals, and over &euro;19 million for Irish, international and local NGOs, as well as missionaries, working in Kenya. Nationally, and through the EU, we will continue to do all we can to assist Kenya in its recovery efforts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government, together with our EU partners, has consistently condemned the practice of hostage-taking and kidnapping by the FARC guerrillas and other illegal armed groups in Colombia and continues to offer full support to the Colombian Government in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict and the release of all hostages.</P>
        <P>The Government remains very seriously concerned about the large number of hostages being held by FARC. Recent reports about the poor health of French-Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt are particularly worrying.</P>
        <P>An all-party Seanad &Eacute;ireann motion in December 2007 strongly supported the ongoing efforts to seek the release of Ingrid Betancourt. This motion was subsequently debated in the Seanad on 10 April 2008, when Minister of State Michael Ahern T.D. spoke on behalf of the Government. All parties to the debate expressed their extreme concern for the failing health of Ms. Betancourt and condemned the appalling conditions of her continued detention.</P><Col N="831"/>
        <P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, welcomes recent initiatives to pursue negotiations with the FARC in order to secure the release of the hostages and bring an end to the internal armed conflict. Current proposals include the establishment of a demilitarised zone, with international observers, from which hostages could be safely released. The Catholic Church in Colombia has been requested to act as a mediator between the Government and the FARC in pursuing this proposal. Colombia has also endorsed a facilitation role by France, Spain and Switzerland, which has the full support of Ireland. Once again, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner was this week in Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela to discuss the situation after an international medical mission to Colombia to treat Ingrid Betancourt was denied access by the FARC. The Minister very much hopes that these initiatives will be successful.</P>
        <P>The Minister would also hope that all those with influence on FARC will encourage it to respond positively.  The General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union most recently adopted Conclusions on Colombia on 19 November 2007. Ireland was actively involved in the negotiation of these Conclusions, which expressed the EU&rsquo;s total solidarity with the Colombian people, its full support for the Colombian Government in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict and underlined the importance the EU attaches to the ongoing implementation of the Justice and Peace Law.</P>
        <P>The Council further expressed its hope that progress would be made in taking forward negotiations in order to reach a humanitarian agreement, to secure the release of all hostages, to end the armed conflict and to bring lasting peace to Colombia. In the same spirit, the Council welcomed all initiatives taken with the Colombian Government&rsquo;s support with the objective of promoting a successful peace process.</P>
        <P>While, in discussions at EU level, we have not considered that current conditions call for UN involvement, Ireland would be supportive were the Colombian Government to request such intervention.  The Department of Foreign Affairs continues to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country. Ireland is fully supportive of efforts to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Colombia and to secure the release of all hostages, including Ms. Betancourt.</P>

	<P>The issue of extraordinary rendition has been raised on numerous occasions in this House. As has been made repeatedly clear, the Government are completely opposed to the practice. The Government has received specific assurances from the US authorities that prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission. These assurances have been confirmed at the highest level, including by Secretary of State Rice to myself and by President Bush to the Taoiseach. The assurances are of a clear and categoric nature, relating to facts and circumstances within the full control of the US Government. I am satisfied that it is appropriate for the Government to rely fully on these assurances and that it is not necessary, in the context of the normal conduct of international relations, to seek them in written form from Secretary Rice. I would stress that no evidence has ever been produced, nor any concrete allegation made, that any person has ever been subject to extraordinary rendition through Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 102 together.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s firm view that democratic reform and national reconciliation in Burma can only be effectively achieved through a fully transparent and inclusive process. The Government deeply regrets that the opposition and ethnic minorities have been excluded from the Constitution drafting process. In this context, neither the referendum nor future elections can realistically be regarded as reflecting the real wishes of the majority of the people of Burma, and will assuredly do nothing to assist the long-term stability and democratic development of Burma.</P>
        <P>I am deeply concerned by limitations on campaigning and reports of intensified intimidation and violence in the run-up to the referendum. I am also concerned that the proposed draft constitution would allow the military to suspend the constitution at will, as well as at its failure to accommodate the country&rsquo;s ethnic diversity.</P>
        <P>Through the strong Conclusions adopted by EU Foreign Ministers earlier this week, and the renewal of restrictive measures against the Burmese regime, the EU has again sent a clear message to the Burmese authorities that they must act meaningfully to ensure real democratisation and national reconciliation in that country.</P>
        <P>I believe that the Burmese authorities must now begin to engage seriously with the UN, which reflects the will of the international community, in particular the mission of the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Representative, Dr Ibrahim Gambari.</P>
        <P>Burma&rsquo;s neighbours, including ASEAN members, continue to play an important role in encouraging the Burmese regime towards genuine dialogue and reform. I welcome the renewed mandate of the EU Special Envoy Piero Fassino in support of UN efforts and in co-ordinating with Asian partners. The EU will over the next few weeks intensify its close consultations with ASEAN members and other neighbours of Burma, including those currently on the UN Security Council.</P>

	<P>I travelled to Northern Ireland on 10 April for a series of official engagements in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I delivered a keynote address to the European Mediation Conference at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast, on the topic of &ldquo;The Role of Government in Lesson Sharing and Conflict Resolution&rdquo;. The event, organised by Mediation Northern Ireland in conjunction with the Scottish Mediation Network, was the second annual conference of the European Mediation Network Initiative, and was timed to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.</P><Col N="833"/>
        <P>I later met with the leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, Ms. Dawn Purvis MLA, with whom I discussed a range of issues including the current political situation, cross border cooperation and efforts to combat sectarianism.</P>
        <P>Finally, I met with a group of young people who are involved in the &lsquo;Building Bridges&rsquo; project. This cross-community project brings together young people from loyalist youth groups and nationalist youth centres from East and West Belfast, and aims to enable them to actively participate in the reconciliation and peace-building taking place within their own communities. This project is funded in part by a grant of &euro;75,000 from my Department&rsquo;s Anti-Sectarianism Fund.</P>

        <Quest> the initiatives being taken by the EU in order to be of assistance in the restoration of civil society in Somalia. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I remain very concerned at the situation in Somalia. The country has been without an effective government since 1991, and despite an initial period of stability after Ethiopian troops and Transitional Federal Government (TFG) forces defeated the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC) in December 2006, the situation has worsened in recent months. Fighting in Mogadishu since October has prompted hundreds of thousands to flee the capital, adding to the humanitarian crisis. In total, approximately one million people have been displaced since the start of 2007, while up to two million need humanitarian aid.</P>
        <P>Re-establishing security and the rule of law remains a major challenge. The first troops from an African Union-mandated peace support force (AMISOM) were deployed to Mogadishu in March 2007 but with less than a quarter of the planned 8,000 troops on the ground, AMISOM has not been able to bring any significant measure of stability. AMISOM&rsquo;s current mandate runs until next August and some consideration has taken place regarding a UN peace-keeping mission to succeed it. However, UN Secretary General Ban has made it clear to the Security Council that, due to the prevailing political and security situation, the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force to Somalia is not a realistic option for the time being.</P>
        <P>The newly appointed Prime Minister in the TFG, Nur Hassan Hussein, has a background in humanitarian organisations, having previously worked for the Red Crescent, and has stated his willingness to engage in discussion with the Islamic opposition. Contacts have already been initiated with members of the opposition based in Asmara. The Prime Minister has had a series of meetings with EU officials, including Development Commissioner Michel and HR Solana. At these meetings he has re-iterated his desire to continue his work towards an inclusive reconciliation with the political opposition.</P>
        <P>An EU local troika of Heads of Missions in Nairobi visited Mogadishu in March and met with members of the government, the opposition, and civil society groups. The troika also met with an umbrella organisation of all Somali Non-State actors (SOSCENSA) formed in Entebbe, Uganda in March 2008. The objective of these meetings was to express the EU&rsquo;s support for the reconciliation process between the TFG and all opposition groups, and underline the EU&rsquo;s commitment to this process.</P>
        <P>Prime Minister Hussein has thanked the EU for their diplomatic engagement in Somalia and expressed his desire that this engagement continue. The EU will continue to extend whatever assistance it can to support the promotion of internal dialogue and national reconciliation within Somalia. The EU is currently the largest aid donor to Somalia, with over &euro;60 million contributed in 2007 alone. Ireland, for its part, will continue its own significant humanitarian <Col N="834"/>engagement in Somalia which since the start of 2006 has involved the provision of over &euro;15 million in humanitarian assistance plus a further &euro;2.6 million in support to civil society.</P>

However, while I of course wish President-elect Lugo every success during his term in office, the accepted protocol in such circumstances is for congratulations to be issued to an incoming President by the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, and this will be taken forward closer to the inauguration of Dr Lugo.</P>

        <P>The Department liaises closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to suspected cases of passport fraud. The Passports Act 2008 introduces a wide range of offences relating to fraudulent applications and the misuse or abuse of passports, whether committed in Ireland or overseas.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 42, 45, 54 and 111 together.</P>
        <P>I am extremely concerned about the dangerous humanitarian and security situation in Gaza. I am appalled that the civilian population continues to face the threat and the reality of violence, and I condemn in particular the killing of a woman and her four young children in an Israeli military operation in Bein Hanoun on Monday. There is an onus now on all parties to act decisively to restore momentum and credibility to the political process. It is important that the EU and the UN use the opportunity of the meeting of the international Quartet in London tomorrow to focus on the urgent need for political progress.</P>
        <P>The EU has strongly supported the courageous move by the Prime Minister of Israel and the Palestinian President to enter into final status negotiations, with the objective of agreement by the end of 2008. However, Deputies will be aware that I have become increasingly concerned that events on the ground in Israel and the Occupied Territories will undermine the political process launched at Annapolis. The immediate priority must therefore be to end all violence in and from the Occupied Territories. This includes Palestinian rocket attacks from Gaza on Israeli territory and Israeli military operations in the West Bank and Gaza. I have called very clearly for an end to the isolation of the people of Gaza and the urgent re-opening of crossing points for people and for goods and for the guaranteed delivery of fuel supplies for the power plant and for vehicles.</P>
        <P>It is essential that restrictions are also lifted on the movement of Palestinians across the West Bank, and that the Israeli Government demonstrate a commitment to a genuine freeze on all settlement expansion. At the European Council in Brussels in March, the EU reiterated that <Col N="836"/>settlement building anywhere in the Occupied Territories, including East Jerusalem, is illegal under international law, prejudges the outcome of final status negotiations and threatens the viability of an agreed two-State solution.</P>
        <P>The Government and our EU partners strongly support the continuing efforts, being led by Egypt, to broker a ceasefire in Gaza, which could provide the basis for a wider agreement between the divided Palestinian groupings, and between Israel and the Palestinians. Any such agreement must involve an end to violence by Hamas and a commitment to the principles of the peace process. I welcome the recent efforts of former US President Jimmy Carter in this regard. It is also important that the Arab States develop their efforts further, on the basis of the historic Arab Peace Initiative which was reaffirmed clearly at the Arab Summit in Riyadh last year.</P>
        <P>The European Union is the largest international donor in support of the Palestinian people, providing almost &euro;1 billion in assistance last year alone. Ireland&rsquo;s assistance has risen by some 70% in the past two years, to &euro;7.5 million in 2007. We will continue to respond to the needs of the Palestinian people. However, the Israeli &mdash; Palestinian conflict is essentially a political problem. The Government will continue to work directly with the parties, in co-operation with our EU partners and through the UN to promote a viable, negotiated two-State solution as the only sustainable solution to the dangerous situation now facing the Israeli and Palestinian people.</P>

	<P>There is a keen desire in the EU to strengthen and deepen its relations with Pakistan. Ireland is strongly supportive of these efforts. Pakistan is critical for regional stability and co-operation in South Asia, as well as in the global context. Pakistan is also important for ongoing stabilisation efforts in Afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, proliferation, narcotics and illegal migration.</P>
        <P>EU-Pakistan political dialogue takes place regularly at Ministerial and Senior Official level. Most recently, on 29 April the General Affairs and External Relations Council discussed the situation in Pakistan and adopted Conclusions welcoming the progress that has been made in the democratic process there. The Conclusions underline the EU&rsquo;s wish to strengthen the existing relationship with Pakistan and point to key areas such as economic development and trade, counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, migration, education, inter-cultural issues and regional cooperation. The Conclusions also emphasise the promotion of human rights &mdash; including women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s rights &mdash; and the need to explore ways to support strengthening of democratic institutions, institution building, legislative reform and voter participation. They state that the EU will approach the Pakistani authorities to explore jointly ways to support these areas. The importance of enhanced EU assistance to, and dialogue on, the rule of law is also underlined.</P>
        <P>The Conclusions adopted on 29 April follow on from earlier Council discussions on Pakistan in January and Conclusions adopted in March which set out EU priorities for cooperation with the new Government in Pakistan.</P><Col N="837"/>
        <P>The EU Election Observation Mission was the biggest and most comprehensive international presence observing the recent elections in Pakistan. The Mission&rsquo;s final report, issued on 16 April, makes a series of recommendations, including relating to the independence of the judiciary and the role of state media. I believe that the success of the Observation Mission provides an opportunity for further cooperation with Pakistan in these areas.</P>

	<P>Ireland funded the position of Deputy to the EU Special Representative in Afghanistan from November 2005 to February 2008. This was done through payments to the budget of the Special Representative&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P>Funding covered salary and allowance costs, which included elements relating to accommodation and children&rsquo;s allowances, as well as covering some home travel. The individual in question was directly employed by the Special Representative&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P>Funding was provided from subhead J of vote 28 (expenditure in support of the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy), in the first year, and thereafter from the Stability Fund of Irish Aid. Since March of this year, costs relating to the individual in question are now directly borne by the office of the Special Representative.</P>
        <P>The mandate of the Special Representative is to pursue a just and durable peace in Afghanistan and his role includes contributing to political stabilisation (including liaison and support for civil society groups in Afghanistan), practical promotion of human rights, and assistance with transitional justice schemes and post-conflict reconciliation.</P>
        <P>Irish funding was provided at the direct request of EU Special Representative Francesc Vendrell. The decision related to a wish to support the significant work of the EU Special Representative in Afghanistan, to support an Irish national in a senior position, the individual&rsquo;s extensive relevant experience, and on the basis of the position&rsquo;s political, developmental, rule of law and human rights dimensions. I would note that the costs of the Special Representative&rsquo;s other professional support staff have been covered by the Member States from which the individuals come (Netherlands, UK and Finland).

	<P>The current situation in Ethiopia is of concern to me and is constantly monitored by our Embassy in Addis Ababa. The situation in parts of Ethiopia appears to be deteriorating with escalating numbers of moderately and severely malnourished people presenting at nutrition centres. The fact that many adolescents are already severely malnourished indicates a critical situation already in the making. The failure of the so-called &ldquo;small rains&rdquo; is a major contributory factor to the emerging crisis.</P><Col N="838"/>
        <P>We are in regular contact with humanitarian agencies on the ground to keep appraised of the latest developments. A member of our Rapid Response Corps has been deployed with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) as a humanitarian affairs officer, and my Department is in regular contact with him regarding the situation.</P>
        <P>Ireland provided over &euro;40 million in development and humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia in 2007. One of the key priorities is to prevent, as far as possible, people falling into absolute hunger and destitution through a targeted programme of social protection, entitled the Productive Safety Nets Programme.</P>
        <P>We are now increasing our assistance to this programme to over &euro;11 million in order to target the most food insecure in the current crisis. More than seven million vulnerable people will be covered by this aid. We are also making a further &euro;3 million available for programmes to assist the rural poor, inter alia, to diversify their crops and purchase new farming assets. Further assistance will be made available as necessary.</P>
        <P>We are also funding our NGO partners working in Ethiopia, particularly in the area of livelihoods. Additionally we have made over &euro;22 million available to the UN Central Emergency Revolving Fund (CERF), which was established to react rapidly to emergencies of this nature. In 2008, the CERF has made emergency funding of US$9 million available for Ethiopia.</P>
        <P>Ireland is working with other donors to ensure that humanitarian financing globally is increased. We also recognise the funding available may be less than identified needs and so we must ensure that the money that is available, is targeted on relieving the suffering of those most in need.</P>

        <Quest> the development implications in general, and the reduction in food security and production in particular, as is occasioned by the direction of countries in the south towards the production of bio-fuels which are directed at meeting the unsustainable transport practices of the north. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Rising oil prices have resulted in the diversion of food crops into bio-fuel production and there is now a recognised linkage between the recent increase in energy prices and the resultant increase in food prices. This has been one of the contributors to the recent rise in global food prices.</P>
        <P>Other factors have also played a role in food price increases. The rapid growth in some Asian economies has generated an increased demand for dairy and meat products &mdash; largely supplied from grain fed animals. An additional factor has been climate change related droughts and poor harvests in major producing countries, most notably in Australia, US, Ukraine and India. These factors have combined to force food prices up, thereby putting them further beyond the reach of the world&rsquo;s poor.</P>
        <P>The issue of food security is a priority for the Government. In its White Paper on Irish Aid, the Government recognised that much more needs to be done at a global level to tackle hunger. To that end a special Hunger Task Force was established. Their task is to identify the additional, appropriate and effective contributions that Ireland can make to international efforts to reduce hunger, and thus achieve the first Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty and hunger by 2015.</P><Col N="839"/>
        <P>The recent global increase in food prices, and Ireland&rsquo;s response, will obviously be a key element for the consideration of the Hunger Task Force. I look forward to the final report of the Hunger Task Force which I understand should be ready around the middle of this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The regime governing the exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf in international law is set down by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Under that Convention a coastal state is entitled to a continental shelf 200 nautical miles (approx. 370 km) in breadth regardless of whether its continental shelf physically extends that far, subject only to the similar rights of its coastal neighbours. It may also claim a broader shelf where it can show that the natural prolongation of its land territory under water actually extends beyond that limit. A claim to extended shelf must be supported by scientific and technical data and be established to the satisfaction of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which was created by the Convention for this purpose.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s shelf naturally extends beyond 200 nautical miles both to the west and the south of the country. For the purposes of our claims we have divided our shelf into three sectors.</P>
        <P>The first sector is to the south-west of the country on the edge of an area known as the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. This sector (which is approximately half the size of the State&rsquo;s land territory) is not disputed by any other state and was therefore the subject of Ireland&rsquo;s first submission to the Commission, made in May 2005. The Commission issued its recommendations in April 2007 concerning the limits of this claimed area. The Government has accepted these recommendations and work is now in hand to designate the additional seabed enclosed by these limits as areas to which the Continental Shelf Act 1968 will apply.</P>
        <P>The second sector of claimed extended continental shelf is in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay where there are unresolved boundary issues with the UK, France and Spain. This sector was the subject of a joint submission by the four countries in May 2006. It covers an area of approximately 80,000 square kilometres, which is slightly larger than the State&rsquo;s land territory. The joint submission remains under consideration by the subcommission established to examine the evidence submitted in support of it. The four states most recently met with the subcommission in New York last month. It is hoped that the subcommission will be in a position to formulate its draft recommendations during 2008. These recommendations must in turn be approved by the full Commission. The question of division of the area between the four states concerned will be considered after the recommendations have been made.</P>
        <P>Ireland also claims continental shelf in the part of the North-East Atlantic Ocean known as the Hatton-Rockall Area, which extends up to 500 nautical miles from the coast. Ireland and the UK agreed a maritime boundary on the continental shelf here in 1988 but this is not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the F&aelig;roe Islands), which also make extensive overlapping claims. The four countries have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the issues arising from overlapping claims but have recently concluded that they are unable to reach agreement at present. Nevertheless the four intend to keep the matter under regular review and, in the meantime, Ireland will proceed to make a national submission to the Commission in respect of the Hatton-Rockall Area by the deadline of May 2009.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 34 together.</P>
        <P>With regard to the possibility of Serbia joining the European Union at a future date, the December 2007 European Council reaffirmed that the future of the Western Balkans lies within the European Union. It considered that a stable and prosperous Serbia fully integrated into the family of European nations is important for the stability of the region. In this regard, it encouraged Serbia to meet the necessary conditions to allow for its Stabilisation and Association Agreement to be signed rapidly. Furthermore, in light of Serbia&rsquo;s considerable institutional capacity, the European Council reiterated its confidence that Serbia&rsquo;s progress on the road towards the EU, including candidate status, can be accelerated provided the required conditions are met.</P>
        <P>The European Union&rsquo;s Stabilisation and Association Process for South-East Europe aims to strengthen political and economic stability in the region and to bring the countries of the region closer to EU standards and principles. The Process involves the negotiation and implementation of Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs) which focus mainly on trade-related issues, political dialogue, legal approximation, and cooperation in sectors such as industry, environment and energy.</P>
        <P>On 29 April last, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia was signed. An Interim Agreement dealing with economic and trade matters was signed at the same time. The General Affairs and External Relations Council welcomed the signature of the SAA and Interim Agreement as an important step on Serbia&rsquo;s path towards the EU. The Council decided that the ratification process of the SAA by Member States and the implementation of the Interim Agreement will begin as soon as the Council decides unanimously that Serbia is co-operating fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).</P>

	<P>The carriage of munitions of war and weapons is prohibited under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order, 1973, unless an exemption has been obtained from the Minister for Transport. I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Mr Noel Dempsey T.D., that applications for exemptions for the carriage of munitions of war, weapons and dangerous goods are considered on a case-by-case basis and factors such as air safety and policy considerations are taken into account in deciding on an application. The majority of exemptions granted in the recent past are in respect of the personal sidearms of the US military personnel travelling through Shannon Airport on chartered civilian aircraft. Overflight and landing arrangements <Col N="841"/>for US forces at Shannon Airport in respect of the Iraq conflict were approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 20 March 2003 after a lengthy debate.</P>

Most recently, Security Council Resolution 1790, adopted unanimously in December 2007 on the request of the Iraqi Government, extends the mandate to the end of 2008.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 48 together.</P>
        <P>On 17 February 2008 the Kosovo Assembly adopted a resolution which declared Kosovo&rsquo;s independence.  At the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 February, EU Foreign Ministers agreed a common response to Kosovo&rsquo;s declaration of independence, noting the uniqueness of Kosovo&rsquo;s situation, arising from the conflict of the 1990s and the eight years of UN administration which followed, and reaffirming the EU&rsquo;s willingness to play a leading role in strengthening stability in the region including by means of the planned ESDP rule of law mission, EULEX Kosovo. The Council also agreed that Member States will decide, in accordance with national practice and international law, on their relations with Kosovo.</P>
        <P>Since then, 18 EU Member States, including Ireland, have recognised Kosovo&rsquo;s independence. At least 21 of the 27 EU Member States are expected to recognise Kosovo in the medium term.</P>
        <P>The Government decided on 28 February that Ireland would recognise the Republic of Kosovo. On the same day, the Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote formally to the President of Kosovo. In that letter, the Minister welcomed the clear commitment of Kosovo to the full implementation of all obligations contained in the Comprehensive Proposal of the UN Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, and informed President Sedjiu of the Government&rsquo;s decision to recognise the independence of the Republic of Kosovo and to establish non-resident diplomatic relations from our Embassy in Hungary.</P>
        <P>There are currently two hundred and eighty-five Defence Forces personnel serving with KFOR. In August 2007, Ireland assumed the role of Framework Nation for the Multinational Task Force (Centre) (MNTF (C)) for one year under the command of Brigadier General Gerry Hegarty. Ireland is committed to maintaining our presence in KFOR as part of a concerted effort for the promotion of stability in the region. In advance of Kosovo&rsquo;s declaration of independence, the Attorney General advised that, in fulfilment of the requirement of the Defence Acts, KFOR would continue to be based on a UN mandate through the continuation in force of Security Council resolution 1244.</P>
        <P>EULEX Kosovo aims to assist Kosovo institutions, judicial authorities and law enforcement agencies in developing and strengthening an independent and multi-ethnic justice system and police and customs service in line with recognised standards and best practice.</P><Col N="842"/>
        <P Just="Left">Deployment of the mission has already begun. There are now over 180 international staff present in Kosovo. Once it reaches full operational capability, the mission will have around 1,900 international police officers, judges, prosecutors and customs officials and approximately 1,100 local staff who will either be based in headquarters in Pristina or located throughout the judicial and police system in Kosovo. There remains some outstanding issues in regard to the deployment of EULEX Kosovo in northern Kosovo, and to its relationship with the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). These issues are under active consideration with the Council of Ministers and the UN.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr Brian Lenihan T.D., has consented to the request of the Garda Commissioner for the secondment of up to eight members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to serve with EULEX Kosovo. My colleague, the Minister for Defence, Mr Willie O&rsquo;Dea T.D., has also agreed to the assignment to the mission of one support staff from the Department of Defence. I very much welcome this involvement by the Garda and the Department of Defence in this civil ESDP mission which is in line with the Government&rsquo;s approach of enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s role in such missions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), adopted in the year 2000 as part of the commitments undertaken by Heads of Government at the Millennium Summit, represent a framework for international economic and social development up to the year 2015. The most important element of the MDGs is that they give us a measurable set of targets, in order that we can determine if progress has been made in reducing global poverty.</P>
        <P>The latest MDG progress report, issued in July 2007, gave us a snapshot of the progress achieved at the midpoint of the 2015 MDG target date, broken down by goal and by region. Overall, there has been good progress on some targets, with more intensive effort required on others.</P>
        <P>On the positive side, the indications are that, if current trends continue, we are on target to reach the MDG on poverty reduction for the world as a whole. Progress has also been made globally in relation to reducing child mortality and increasing school enrolment rates.</P>
        <P>However, there are still areas in which progress is slow or negligible. It is clear, for example, that if the target on maternal mortality is to be reached, a major international effort will be required. This is a matter of great concern to Ireland and our official aid programme, Irish Aid. We have increased our efforts in this area through support to the UN Maternal Health Trust Fund &ldquo;No Woman should Die Giving Life&rdquo;, as well as supporting the work of UNFPA, the   primary UN agency for maternal health. We remain conscious that more needs to be done in this and other areas.</P>
        <P>Ireland is also responding to the geographical disparity in progress in the MDGs. Much of the progress to date is due to advances in China and in Asia generally. Africa is lagging behind <Col N="843"/>on most indicators. This is attributed to a combination of institutional weakness, civil and international conflict, and funding shortfalls. Irish Aid continues to focus over 80% per cent of assistance on sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
        <P>While it is true that a funding shortfall exists in the commitments made by donors to achieve the MDGs, Ireland is engaged fully in this respect. As set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid, the MDGs are the overarching framework for our official aid programme. By delivering on the commitment to reach the 0.7% UN target for development funding by 2012, Ireland is perceived as being at the forefront of their implementation internationally. We will continue to lead by example, and encourage other donors to live up to the commitments we have all made to the help the poorest of the poor in developing countries.</P>
        <P>I believe that each and every one of the MDGs must be met to achieve the progress that the developing world both needs and deserves. These Goals were carefully chosen, with specific targets in mind, and are fully mutually reinforcing. Ireland will continue to closely monitor the progress against each of the Goals, and tailor our actions to ensure their achievement.</P>

	<P>Peace and stability in Iraq are vital to the welfare of the Iraqi people, and to the prospects for the wider Middle East region. The European Union is firmly committed to supporting a secure, stable, democratic, prosperous and united Iraq, with the capacity to play a constructive regional role. Since the military intervention in 2003 and the fall of Saddam Hussein, the Union has acted consistently to support the Iraqi people as they rebuild their society and their economy following decades of brutal dictatorship and war. This priority was emphasised again when the situation in Iraq was discussed at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg this week.</P>
        <P>The EU has been one of the main contributors of non-military assistance to Iraq. Since 2003, total assistance has amounted to over &euro;1 billion, including &euro;830 million in Community aid.</P>
        <P>On the political level, the EU strongly supported the early return of sovereignty to a democratic Iraqi Government. The Union offered extensive support to the electoral process, including advice, expertise and financial assistance to the Iraqi Electoral Commission, and to the major task of drafting a new Constitution and key legislation. The EU and the Member States have used their influence consistently to encourage Iraqi political parties, and their leaders, in the process of national reconciliation which is the essential key to the restoration of lasting peace and stability. The Union has been working closely with the UN assistance mission in Iraq, and has developed strong links on the ground with the UN, through the office of the Commission in Baghdad.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made in the negotiation of a Trade and Cooperation Agreement with Iraq, which will establish a contractual relationship between the EU and Iraq for the first time. These negotiations have provided an early opportunity for Iraqis to witness their democratically-elected Government operating internationally on their behalf. The EU has underlined its readiness to conclude the negotiations as rapidly as possible. The EU has also supported the elaboration and implementation of the International Compact for Iraq, which was established last year to organise international assistance for Iraq in accordance with the priorities of the Iraqi Government, and under its general direction. I welcome the initiative of <Col N="844"/>the Swedish Government to organise the first annual review of the Compact in Stockholm on 29 May.</P>
        <P>In close consultation with the Iraqi Government, the Union has identified the need to address the administrative weakness and inexperience evident across the Iraqi public service. This is the inevitable result of the destruction and dislocation of war, after decades of dictatorship, conflict and mismanagement. The Union has placed a high priority on capacity building and the provision of training and advice and expertise. An EU Joint Action, EUJUST LEX, has focused specifically on assisting Iraqi professionals in the criminal justice sphere. The Government has contributed to the effort most recently through the organisation of a training course in Ireland last November for Iraqi prison governors.</P>
        <P>Despite daily reports of violence across Iraq, it is clear that there has been progress, albeit slow, in the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq. Nonetheless, the humanitarian needs of the people continue to pose a huge challenge to the international community. We are particularly concerned by the large numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons, and by the burden being borne by neighbouring states, especially Jordan and Syria. The EU will continue to address the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people and the plight of refugees, and Ireland will continue to play its part. The Government provided over &euro;5 million in humanitarian assistance for Iraq last year.</P>

	<P>Ireland does not provide food aid directly to any African country. Ireland does however provide financial support to emergency food aid programmes. Such financial support is provided both through the European Commission and through the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).</P>
        <P>The European Commission does not provide food aid in kind. Rather, the European Commission provides financial support to food aid recipient countries which is used to purchase food, to the greatest degree possible, in local and regional markets. Such schemes are administered by the WFP. I fully support the purchase of food locally where at all possible.</P>
        <P>I understand that the WFP&rsquo;s policy on GM food is that this is a matter for the Government of the recipient State, and that the WFP respects their decision. In relation to the privatisation of the banking sector, I should make it clear that Ireland does not make the privatisation of the banking sector a condition of any of its development assistance.</P>

        <P>All posts in my Department have been filled for the past five years either as a result of a competition advertised directly by the Department or on foot of competitions organised by the Public Appointments Service, which is the centralised provider of recruitment, assessment and selection services for the Civil Service.</P>
        <P>The question of the adequate staffing levels required to carry out the work of the Department, including Irish Aid, is kept under active review. The recent White Paper on Irish Aid recommended a major Management Review of Irish Aid be undertaken in conjunction with the Department of Finance. This is currently underway and is examining, among other issues, staffing levels necessary to guide the programme as funding expands towards reaching the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on official aid by 2012 and to ensure the huge increases in aid allocations can be delivered optimally in terms of accountability and quality. Work is now well advanced on this review and it is expected that it will lead to proposals being put before Government this year.</P>

	<P>As stated in my reply of 23 April 2008, the Secretary General of my Department met with the Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires of the Embassy of Brazil on 28 March 2008, at the latter&rsquo;s request.</P>
        <P>The meeting was conducted in an open and friendly atmosphere, reflecting the good relations between Ireland and Brazil. A useful and constructive discussion took place across a number of issues relating to immigration from Brazil to Ireland, which has seen a dramatic increase in recent years.</P>
        <P>In the course of the discussion, the Brazilian side highlighted the case referred to by the Deputy where Brazilian nationals were denied entry to this country. They requested certain assurances in relation to procedures that would be followed in the event that Brazilian nationals were denied entry in the future. The Secretary General informed them that in relation to immigration, decisions in individual cases, the general requirements for entry and the subsequent arrangements for those denied entry to the State are a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, rather than for my Department. However, the Secretary General noted their requests and, following the meeting, briefed the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the discussions and the particular issues raised by the Brazilians.</P>
        <P>Neither the individuals referred to by the Deputy, nor their families, have been in direct contact with my Department, nor did the question of an apology arise.</P>

	<P>I am fully committed to the enactment of comprehensive legislation on cluster munitions as soon as possible following the outcome of the Dublin Diplomatic Conference on Cluster Munitions, which is to be held later this month. The intention will be to allow for the earliest possible ratification by Ireland of the Convention which is to be finalised at the Conference, and which is expected to include not just a ban on cluster munitions causing unacceptable harm to civilians but also provisions regarding assistance to victims, clearance of areas contaminated by unexploded cluster munitions, and assistance in their destruction. In my view it would not make sense to prepare domestic legislation before the final terms of the Convention are known, and for that reason I do not intend to publish heads of legislation before the Conference.</P>
        <P>To ensure that the legislation is of the highest possible quality, the Government has decided to establish a new national committee on humanitarian law, which will have as its first task the preparation of this comprehensive legislation on cluster munitions. I wish our legislation to provide a comprehensive model and template for other states as they proceed to implementation of the Convention. It is our intention to advance work on the Bill as quickly as possible following the Conference.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Kosovo final status issue, along with our partners in the EU, has been that a final settlement for Kosovo must provide for a multi-ethnic, secure and democratic Kosovo, consistent with EU values and standards and contributing to the stability of the region. The EU has consistently highlighted the protection of minorities, and the right to return of refugees and internally displaced persons, as key priorities in this context.</P><Col N="848"/>
        <P>Ireland has been strongly supportive of the proposal by the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Envoy on Kosovo, former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, which provided for internationally supervised independence for Kosovo with strong guarantees for the rights of Serbs and other minorities. His proposal specifically included provisions on the rights to return of refugees and internally displaced persons and stated that they shall have the right to return and reclaim their property and personal possessions based upon a voluntary and informed decision. The Government, through Irish Aid, has been pleased to contribute to return projects in Kosovo in recent years.</P>
        <P>As part of the gradual transfer of competences from the interim UN Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) to the Provisional Institutions of Self Government (PISG), provided for under UN Security Council Resolution 1244, most of the functional responsibilities for voluntary returns have now been assumed by the PISG, primarily the Ministry of Community and Return (MCR). However, UNMIK continues to provide assistance and guidance to the MCR as appropriate. In a report dated 28 March 2008, UNMIK noted that while slightly more internally displaced persons (IDPs) returned to Kosovo in 2007 than in 2006, the number of returns remain disappointingly low. The report notes that the UNHCR estimates that 1, 756 minority community members returned in 2007 as opposed to 1, 668 in 2006. In addition 19 Roma families returned to Abdullah Presheva/Abduallh Presevo (Gjilan/Gnjilane) on 26 February 2008 under a UNDP project financed by the Kosovo Consolidated Budget.</P>
        <P>The report adds that the Ministry of Communities and Returns (MCR) budget for returns is &euro;7.14 million for 2008, an increase from &euro;5.2 million in 2007. The Ministry has proposed to allocate this amount for Community Development and Stabilization projects, construction of social housing for IDPs, organised return projects and individual returns.</P>
        <P>The Report identified a number of challenges ahead including that, with UNHCR&rsquo;s support, the MCR has achieved progress towards the finalisation of the returnee database but progress is still needed in establishing the IDP database.</P>
        <P>The Kosovo Assembly declared independence on 17 February and stated that it accepted fully the obligations for Kosovo contained in the Ahtisaari proposal and undertook to implement the obligations through priority adoption of legislation, particularly those that protect and promote the rights of communities and their members. In addition to this, the Constitution, adopted by the Kosovo Assembly on 9 April, states that the Republic of Kosovo shall promote and facilitate the safe and dignified return of refugees and internally displaced persons and assist them in recovering their property and possessions.</P>
        <P>The Government strongly believes that a comprehensive policy on the right to return must form an integral part of the governance of Kosovo and be integrated into Kosovo&rsquo;s future legal framework. In my letter to President Sedjiu of Kosovo of 28 February informing him that the Government had decided to recognise Kosovo, I welcomed the clear commitment of Kosovo to the full implementation of all obligations contained in the Ahtisaari proposal. I welcome now that specific provisions for the rights of refugees and internally displaced persons have been incorporated into the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo and I urge the Kosovo authorities to pursue concrete and rapid progress on these important issues.</P>

	<P>The EU military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, has faced a number of challenges including force generation and logistics, as well as the insecurity caused by rebel movements in Chad earlier this year. The mission suffered the tragic loss of a French soldier in March. However, very substantial progress has now been made in deploying the force and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was declared on 15 March 2008 with Full Operational Capability (FOC) expected later this summer with the full deployment of the three multinational battalions. There are currently nearly 2000 troops from eighteen different EU Member States on the ground in Chad.</P>
        <P>Lt. General Pat Nash, Operation Commander of EUFOR, who is based at the Operation Headquarters in Mont Valerien near Paris, visited Chad from 7-11 April. Following that visit he has reported to the EU Political and Security Committee that EUFOR is now making its presence felt throughout the Area of Operations and is establishing the basis to make a real difference prior to the rainy season. General Nash also reported on the development of EUFOR&rsquo;s security support to the UN policing mission MINURCAT.</P>
        <P>I understand from my colleague the Minister for Defence, Mr. Willie O&rsquo;Dea TD, that a total of 247 Defence Forces personnel are currently serving with EUFOR. When the balance of the Irish contingent deploys later this month this figure will increase to approximately 430, with the bulk of the personnel serving with the 97th Infantry Battalion in the field in eastern Chad, plus staff at Force HQ in Chad and Operational HQ in Paris. Construction of the Irish Camp at Goz Beida, where the main Irish force will be based, is advancing well. Army Ranger Wing (ARW) personnel deployed in Chad as part of the Initial Entry Force are also currently conducting patrols and route reconnaissance operations in the vicinity of Goz Beida.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the progress now being made in the deployment of EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, particularly given the crucial humanitarian role the mission is to play in relation to the protection of vulnerable refugees and internally displaced people and of the humanitarian convoys necessary to relieve their distress. We can be proud of the role being played by General Nash and his colleagues in the Defence Forces in this vital EU mission.</P>

        <Quest> the initiatives that have been taken to strengthen the research capacity of Irish Aid; the funding which is being allocated each year for the research advisory working group since 2003 to date in 2008; and the institutions which have received funding. </Quest>

	<P>I believe that research is central to improving the quality of our aid programme at all levels &mdash; the global, regional and country levels. Implementing the findings of well targeted research means better and more effective aid programmes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Advisory Board for Irish Aid (ABIA) has a mandate to commission research of the highest international standards. The Board funds ongoing research in areas such as policy coherence, measuring the impact of aid and good governance.</P>
        <P>The Research Advisory Working Group is a small internal body of the Advisory Board and consists of three Board members and Advisory Board secretariat staff. Separate steering committees oversee each research project. A representative from Irish Aid sits on these steering committees.</P>
        <P>Specific pieces of research are commissioned through the normal tendering process. Funding is provided to a number of Irish and overseas institutions for this work &mdash; Trinity College <Col N="850"/>Dublin, NUI Galway, Dublin City University, the Haughton Institute (St. James&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin), the Overseas Development Institute and Oxford Policy Management group. Each of these in turn links with one or more developing country institutions to undertake the research. In this way, research capacity in developing countries is improved. Since 2003 funding amounting to approximately &euro;2.45 million has been provided for this work.</P>
        <P>As well as this research undertaken by ABIA, Irish Aid has initiated two programmes to stimulate and enhance domestic research activity around international development. Funding has been provided through the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for a programme of strategic cooperation with higher education and research institutions. This links education and research institutions in Ireland with similar institutions in the developing countries that benefit from our support. Funding is also provided to the Health Research Board (HRB) for Irish researchers focusing on international health issues. The funding via the HEA is approximately &euro;20.4 million over five years and the HRB is approximately &euro;2.5 million over two years.</P>
        <P>We also support the network of agricultural research institutions known as CGIAR (the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research). The aim of this work is to assist in practical and pro-poor agricultural research that can have a positive effect on the lives of the poor.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid supports a range of operational research to evaluate the impact of global and country HIV initiatives it funds. An example is the Joint Learning Initiative on Children affected by HIV and AIDS (JLICA). This research partnership was established to identify and address the needs of children affected by HIV and AIDS. In October this year, Ireland will co-host with UNICEF, the 4th Global Partners&rsquo; Forum (GPF) on children affected by HIV and AIDS. The GPF will base key commitments to children affected by HIV and AIDS on the findings of this research.</P>
        <P>Research is very important to the aid programme. It is equally important that such research is practical and focused on the important issues we are dealing with on a day to day basis. Research has to provide decision makers with the information needed to make better and more informed judgements. I believe that the research funded by Irish Aid is very valuable in this regard.</P>

	<P>Ireland supports the competitiveness and cohesion policies, which are key priorities for the European Union. These priorities are reflected in the Union&rsquo;s Lisbon Strategy, which aims to make Europe a more competitive and knowledge-driven economy, and in the EU&rsquo;s budgetary framework, which provides significant financial resources for the implementation of competitiveness and cohesion policies. </P>
        <P>Over the years, Ireland has benefited hugely from EU cohesion funding and continues to view economic and social cohesion as a pillar of EU integration.  There has been no diminution in the Union&rsquo;s commitment to cohesion or to competitiveness.  Indeed, the statement of the Union&rsquo;s basic aims contained in the Lisbon Reform Treaty highlights the commitment to &lsquo;balanced economic growth&rsquo; and &lsquo;a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress.&rsquo;  The Treaty also commits the Union to promoting &lsquo;economic, social and territorial cohesion, and solidarity among Member States.&rsquo;</P>

	<P>I welcome the holding of Constituent Assembly elections in Nepal on 10 April 2008.  It was an important landmark in the country&rsquo;s peace process, which began when the Government and the Maoists signed a peace accord in November 2006. </P>
        <P>The EU mounted an Observation Mission to these elections, in which Ireland participated.  Due to the complexities of the electoral process and the unique geography of Nepal, the mission will stay on the ground until mid-May.  The Mission&rsquo;s preliminary statement has concluded that Election Day was largely successful, despite a tense campaign period.  The EU Presidency, on 16 April, welcomed the fact that the elections were held in a largely peaceful and orderly manner and called on the political parties to respect the election results.  I welcome the fact that the main political parties have indicated that they accept the results as a basis for forming the Constituent Assembly.</P>
        <P>The Assembly will include a mix of members elected directly and by a system of proportional representation to ensure a greater share of women and marginalised castes and ethnic groups.  It will be tasked with drafting a new constitution for Nepal. Although the election results have yet to be finalised, the Maoists have emerged as the largest party in the new Assembly, and are likely to lead the new government.  It remains important that the Maoists take the necessary steps to totally eschew violence and follow solely constitutional means.</P>
        <P>While Nepal has made remarkable progress towards peace, challenges remain including the continuing need to address the legitimate aspirations of ethnic groups. Ireland and the EU will continue to actively support the peace process and the development of Nepal.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs Service has responsibility for implementing import controls at points of entry to the State, specifically at ports and airports, including licensed airfields, and on the land frontier.  The control of licensed airfields in the State is carried out by enforcement teams that focus on the smuggling of prohibited drugs and fiscal products.</P>
        <P>Best practice in customs administration worldwide shows that the development of information and intelligence is critical to the detection of drug and fiscal smuggling.  In Ireland, this has been very important since the completion of the Single Market in 1993, based as it is on the free movement of goods and people within the Community.  Because Intra-Community travellers have the right of free movement, Revenue has no power to stop them except on the basis of a suspicion, normally grounded in specific intelligence.</P>
        <P>Private jets and helicopters arriving into the State at Dublin Airport are handled by a number of executive jet service operators.  Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service at Dublin Airport receives advance notification of all arrivals of light aircraft and helicopters from the executive jet service <Col N="852"/>operators.  Passenger manifests are submitted and all private flights are checked on the basis of risk analysis of the data supplied by the operators and available intelligence.</P>
        <P>Passengers and crew arriving on intra-Community flights are ordinarily allowed to proceed, unless Customs determine, through risk profiling, that they require to be examined.  In all such cases the aircraft is subject to search and the passengers and crew must present themselves, with their baggage, at the Customs Channels within the main Terminal for examination.</P>
        <P>Passengers and crew on flights arriving from an airport outside the European Community must present themselves and their baggage at the Customs Channels in the main terminal for clearance.</P>
        <P>Based on Dublin Airport Authority data, the numbers of private aircraft that arrived at Dublin Airport since 1 January 2005, including training flights and flights from other airports within the State, are 12,109 in 2005, 14,104 in 2006, 14,697 in 2007 and 3,603 in 2008 to date.  Matters relating to passport check arrangements at Dublin Airport fall under the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 81 together.</P>
        <P>At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances.  Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Persons aged seventy years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means.  The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</P>
        <P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of general practitioner services.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  In June 2006, I agreed with the HSE to raise the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.  For medical card and GP visit card applications, the HSE now considers an applicant&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income.  Allowances are also made for expenses on child care, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.  However, my Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.  As part of this general review, a review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards in the context of economic/financial, medical and social need is being undertaken with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card, and is expected to be completed by Autumn, 2008.</P>

	<P>Persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) <Col N="855"/>services qualify for a medical card, which entitles them to a range of health services free of charge.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>The assessment of eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged 70 and over, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).  The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 87 together.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in July 2005 that the best option for improving geographic access for patients in the North West to radiation oncology services is to (i) facilitate access to Belfast City Hospital (BCH) and (ii) progress consideration of a joint venture for the provision of oncology services in the medium term to patients in the North West from a satellite centre in the North West linked to BCH.</P>
        <P>Cancer patients in the North West requiring radiation oncology treatment are referred to either St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin or University College Hospital Galway.  A Service Level Agreement is also in place for the referral of radiation oncology patients from Donegal to BCH.</P>
        <P>I met with Minister Michael McGimpsey of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSS&amp;PS), Northern Ireland on 28 November last. We discussed the potential for further cross-border collaboration in relation to cancer care, and specifically, provision of a satellite centre for radiation oncology in the North West, linked to Belfast City Hospital.  I welcome Minister McGimpsey&rsquo;s announcement last month, of the provision of a satellite centre (linked to Belfast City Hospital) to be located in Altnagelvin. It will provide the additional radiotherapy capacity needed to meet an anticipated increase in cancer in Northern Ireland and recognises the potential for cross border co-operation in the development of this resource. Officials from my Department and the DHSS&amp;PS will hold further discussions in this regard.</P>
        <P>The specific question raised by the Deputy in relation to quality standards in the provision of radiotherapy services relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this regard.</P>

        <P>Transport 21 represents the largest capital investment commitment ever made by Government to the development of transport infrastructure in this country.

        <P>Given the scale and reach of Transport 21 I consider it essential that the general public and all interested parties are made aware of the programme and of the many transport improvements that are already being delivered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Therefore, as part of a wider information and communications strategy and following a public procurement process, my Department engaged the services of consultants to undertake a media advertising campaign to raise public awareness of Transport 21. The campaign involves television, radio, press and outdoor advertising and I envisage that it will be necessary to continue to provide information and awareness to the public and all interested parties for the duration of Transport 21.  The budget allocated for 2008 for this campaign is &euro;2.9 million and the project is progressing within this budget.</P>

	<P>The licensing of small public service vehicles (i.e. taxis, wheelchair accessible taxis, hackneys and limousines) was a function of individual local licensing authorities at the time of liberalisation in November 2000.  Taxi licence information from 1999 to 2005 available to my Department is based on statistical returns made by individual local authorities who had declared taximeter areas from time to time.  The Commission for Taxi Regulation is now responsible for the licensing of small public service vehicles and, with effect from 25 September 2006, the Commission has replaced the individual local authority taximeter areas with one single national taximeter area.   Since the establishment of a national taximeter area, taxi licence statistical data is available from the Commission for Taxi Regulation on the basis of the home address of taxi licence holders.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the above position, the following tables reflect the statistical information available to my Department in relation to the number of licensed taxis/wheelchair accessible taxis at various dates between 1999 and 2005.   The December 2007 and March 2008 licence statistics were received from the Commission for Taxi Regulation and are based on the home address of licence holders.</P>
        <P>Insofar as limits on taxi licence numbers are concerned, the October 2000 High Court judgement which led to taxi liberalisation created the legal position that limitation of taxi licences in the interests of existing licence holders could not be sustained.  Regulations made in November 2000 responded to the new legal situation established by reference to the decision of the High Court. Subsequently, the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, which provides the legislative basis for the licensing and operation of small public service vehicles generally, does not provide a basis for the application of quantitative controls on the issue of licences for any such vehicles.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Taxi Regulation is now the independent public body responsible for the development and maintenance of the regulatory framework for the control and operation, including licensing, of taxis, hackneys, limousines and their drivers.  However, the Commission does not have any remit or statutory power under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 in relation to the control of the number of licences issued.  The Commission is, however, progressing policy and supporting regulation in relation to such aspects within its statutory control as vehicle standards and driver skills and knowledge.  This will contribute to enhancing the overall standards that a small public service vehicle operator must meet to obtain either a small public service vehicle driver or vehicle licence.</P>

	<P>In recent years and particularly since the 2004 enlargement, the EU has placed increased emphasis on building up relations with Russia and other eastern neighbours. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), which came into force in December 1997 for an initial ten year period, has been &ldquo;rolled over&rdquo; pending a new agreement, negotiations on which are expected to begin shortly. The EU has a wide-ranging relationship with Russia. Trade is now five times its 2000 level, investment in both directions is growing rapidly, and Russia and the EU are mutually dependent in the energy sector. There have been some worrying trends in Russian domestic policies in recent years as well as a more challenging Russian approach in foreign policy. The agreement, in May 2005, on Roadmaps for the four &lsquo;Common Spaces&rsquo; (Common Economic Space; Common Space on Freedom, Security and Justice; Common Space on External Security; Common Space on Research and Education) <Col N="867"/>encompassed all aspects of the relationship. Notable recent achievements include increased cooperation in the fight against terrorism, biannual human rights consultations, and agreements with Schengen countries on visa facilitation and readmission.</P>
        <P>Since 2003, relations with Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan are being developed in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). The European Neighbourhood Policy is intended to support greater economic development, stability and better governance in the EU&rsquo;s neighbourhood. Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia have individual ENP Action Plans. Moldova and Ukraine have visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Schengen countries. Since December 2006 the policy has encompassed enhanced regional cooperation, expanded financial resources and other forms of cooperation. The EU is negotiating an &lsquo;enhanced&rsquo; agreement with Ukraine, which will include a deep Free Trade Agreement.  The European Neighbourhood Policy remains entirely distinct from the issue of EU membership.</P>
        <P>Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are covered by the first EU strategy for Central Asia, adopted in June 2007. The strategy is intended to intensify the EU&rsquo;s cooperation with Central Asian countries on an individual and regional basis. EU priorities papers have been drawn up in consultation with each of the five countries. Regional EU initiatives on education, rule of law and water management are being put into effect. A report on progress in implementing the strategy will be given to the June European Council.</P>

	<P>The Government shares the genuine and broadly held desire across the European Union for improved relations with Iran.  The EU and Iran share an interest in a stable, prosperous and peaceful Middle East. I believe there are no unbridgeable divides between our interests and those of the Iranian people. </P>
        <P>However, it has been clear for some years that there are a number of broad areas in which the policies being pursued by the Iranian authorities represent obstacles to the building of closer relations with the EU and the wider international community. These include the serious international concern about the nature of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme, the negative role being played in relation to efforts to resolve peacefully the interlinked political problems of the Middle East region, and growing concerns about the level of human rights abuses in Iran.</P>
        <P>I regret that Iran has seemed unable to engage in serious dialogue on any of these issues in recent years. The EU has taken the lead in the search for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue, in cooperation with the US, Russia and China. The Taoiseach and I reviewed these efforts with President Bush during our meeting in the White House yesterday. The important comprehensive offer conveyed to Iran by the EU in 2006 included incentives for wide-ranging engagement between Iran and the international community in the context of agreement to address the concerns set out clearly by the UN Security Council on the nuclear issue. This <Col N="868"/>major diplomatic offer remains on the table, and will be pursued further by the EU. I would reiterate our appeal to Iran to engage with it constructively, to the benefit of the people of Iran and its region and of Europe.</P>
        <P>The Government maintains regular contact with the Iranian authorities through meetings at Ministerial and official level and through our Embassy in Tehran. We have made it clear that we are at all times ready to develop further our political dialogue with Iran on the basis of a genuine readiness to address all issues of concern to both sides.</P>

	<P>I remain deeply concerned about the situation in Afghanistan. There are very clear concerns regarding security, human rights, governance and rule of law issues, as well as narcotics.</P>
        <P>The security situation remains a continuous cause of concern. While the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has enjoyed significant military successes over the past number of months, insurgency-related violence continues at a high level, particularly against the Afghan police. There are strong indications that suicide attacks and improvised explosive devices will remain the insurgency&rsquo;s main weapon against Afghan and international security forces. Last weekend&rsquo;s attack on President Karzai, which fortunately he survived, was further evidence of the fragility of the situation.</P>
        <P>A decision on the timing of elections was announced on 9 April. The Presidential election will take place in autumn 2009 and parliamentary elections will be held in the summer of 2010. The elections and the preceding voter registration will be enormous logistical tasks and will require immediate consideration by the Afghan government and its partners.</P>
        <P>We can see in many parts of Afghanistan the benefits that peace, the rule of law and stable government can bring, with economic growth, lower mortality rates and greater participation in formal schooling, especially among girls. The goal for the international community, in cooperation with the Afghan government, remains to extend stable and legitimate government and the rule of law to all parts of the country.</P>
        <P>Better coordination and cooperation in the international community&rsquo;s assistance to Afghanistan is vital, and has been the key focus of recent reviews of policy by the UN, NATO and the EU. I very much welcome the recent appointment of the Mr Kai Eide, as Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for Afghanistan. The UN continues to play the lead coordinating role in Afghanistan. The renewal and strengthening of the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) by the UN Security Council last month should strengthen its ability to lead international civilian efforts to provide political outreach, support reconciliation programmes and strengthen cooperation with ISAF.  It also calls for additional efforts on rule of law, corruption, narcotics, human rights and economic development.</P>
        <P>At the NATO Summit in Bucharest on 3 April 2008, the ISAF troop-contributing nations, including Ireland, reconfirmed their long-term commitment to Afghanistan and supported the need for an enhanced UN role in coordinating civil and military efforts by the international community.</P><Col N="869"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>International coordination efforts will also be a key issue for the planned international donor conference on Afghanistan to be held in Paris in June. The conference will focus on strengthening Government institutions, including by securing further pledges of support.</P>
        <P>The EU remains fully engaged in Afghanistan.  Afghanistan was discussed at the March European Council following the adoption of Conclusions on Afghanistan at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 March. These Conclusions reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to long-term support for Afghanistan. The Conclusions also welcomed the progress of the EU Police Mission in Afghanistan, which is currently deploying to the regions. Afghanistan will again be on the agenda of the General Affairs and External Relations Council this month.</P>
        <P>Ireland has provided over &euro;14 million in relief, recovery and development assistance to Afghanistan since 2005. In addition, seven members of the Permanent Defence Forces serve with ISAF in Kabul.</P>

	<P>Ireland closely monitors developments in the human rights situation throughout the world and, where the situation warrants, we make known our concerns to the governments in question, bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly or the UN Human Rights Council. Ireland also supports the work of the International Criminal Court, which marks a real effort to end impunity for war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, and which is investigating four situations in Africa. </P>
        <P>The risk of human rights violations is of course greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak. Development is essential to allow people the full enjoyment of their human rights, and Africa lies at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s development co-operation programme. Irish Aid supports specific actions designed to promote human rights, including by strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions, in particular through legal training. Irish Aid has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.</P>
        <P>The importance of the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world is a cornerstone of the European Union&rsquo;s external action. In its political dialogue with individual African countries under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, the EU regularly raises issues which arise in the development of democracy and the need for protection and promotion of human rights.</P>
        <P>The African Union has an important and growing role to play in the protection of human rights in Africa. The aims of the African Union include the promotion of peace, security, and democracy on the continent, as well as the promotion and protection of human rights, in accordance with the African Charter on Human and People&rsquo;s Rights. The emergence of African standards in this area is a very welcome development.</P>
        <P>The EU-Africa Joint Strategy, which was adopted at the Lisbon Summit in December 2007, commits Europe and Africa to closer political dialogue, which will provide an opportunity to raise human rights issues as required. One of the initial Partnerships under the Joint Strategy will focus on democratic governance and human rights. Preliminary discussions have taken place between the EU and the African Union on establishing a regular dialogue between the <Col N="870"/>two organisations on human rights issues. It is expected that the first formal dialogue meeting will take place at official level at the end of May 2008.</P>

	<P>The Government continues to attach the highest importance to resolving the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States. The Taoiseach emphasised this commitment during his address to the US Congress yesterday. I am also having a series of meetings on the issue with key Congressional figures and with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform in Washington this week. </P>
        <P>Following the failure of the US Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation last June, despite the strong endorsement and encouragement of President Bush, the Government immediately set about exploring with key US Administration and Congressional contacts possible alternative bilateral options. In particular, we have lobbied congressional figures on a specific reciprocal proposal that, if successful, would make thousands of visas available annually to Irish citizens, including the undocumented, and to US citizens interested in working in Ireland.</P>
        <P>However, achieving progress on immigration reform at this time, in the middle of a Presidential campaign, is exceptionally difficult. The political reality in the United States is that immigration has become a divisive political issue. Our many friends in Congress have emphasised this, including the difficulty of passing legislation specifically for our citizens separate from the other 12 million undocumented.</P>
        <P>Despite these considerable political challenges, the Government will continue to press for change and will work closely with our friends in Congress and with the many organisations <Col N="871"/>who have worked hard on behalf of the undocumented in the Irish community, including the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform (ILIR).</P>

	<P>It is not the practice of the Government to classify countries in the manner suggested by the Deputy. However, it is clear that hunger, conflict and human rights abuses are prevalent in too many parts of the world and that they are frequently linked. </P>
        <P>We recognise the essential interconnections between collective security, development, and human rights and these areas are central to our foreign policy and to the work of the UN and EU. Active participation in the UN, EU, OSCE and Council of Europe provides an opportunity for Ireland to voice its concerns on these areas. Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for violation of human rights in all their forms. The UN has primary responsibility for resolving threats to international peace and security, but the EU is also working to develop its capacity to promote stability and conflict resolution as indicated, for example, by the ESDP missions in Chad and Kosovo. In relation to alleviating hunger, the lead role is played by the World Food Programme of the United Nations, with support from many other actors, notably the EU&rsquo;s ECHO (European Community Humanitarian aid Office) programme. The recent sharp rise in food costs poses an additional threat.</P>
        <P>Overall, while good progress has been registered in certain regions, many serious issues, whether related to hunger, human rights abuses or conflict, remain for the international community to address.</P>

	<P>The December 2007 European Council reaffirmed that the future of the Western Balkans lies within the European Union and the countries of the region (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) continue to feature on the agenda of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. On 18 February last, EU Foreign Ministers recalled the Union&rsquo;s longstanding commitment to strengthening stability in the region. Foreign Ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to support fully the European perspective for the Western Balkans and asked the Commission to use community instruments to promote economic and political developments in the region. </P>
        <P>The European Union&rsquo;s Stabilisation and Association Process for South-East Europe aims to bring the countries of the region closer to EU standards and principles. The Process involves the negotiation of Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs) with each of the countries which focus mainly on trade liberalisation in goods and other trade-related issues, political dialogue, legal approximation, and cooperation in sectors such as industry, environment and energy.</P><Col N="872"/>
        <P>SAAs have been signed with Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro. The SAA with Serbia was signed earlier this week, on 29 April 2008. An Interim Agreement dealing with economic and trade matters was signed at the same time. The Council welcomed the signature of the SAA and the Interim Agreement as an important step on Serbia&rsquo;s path towards the EU. The Council decided that the ratification process of the SAA by Member States and implementation of the Interim Agreement will begin as soon as the Council decides unanimously that Serbia is cooperating fully with the ICTY.</P>
        <P>Negotiations on an SAA with Bosnia and Herzegovina were finalised late last year. The timing of the signature is linked to sufficient progress by Bosnia and Herzegovina in addressing key priorities, notably in police reform, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), public broadcasting and public administration reform.  At their meeting on 29 April, EU Foreign Ministers welcomed the conclusion of the first phase of police reform by the recent adoption of two laws on the subject. While the Council acknowledged that Bosnia and Herzegovina will need to undertake further efforts to address reforms, the Council expressed its readiness to sign the SAA as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Stabilisation and Association Process, the European Union opened negotiations on accession with Croatia in 2005. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has obtained candidate status, although its negotiations on accession have not yet commenced.</P>
        <P>Recent developments in the Western Balkans have largely focused on Kosovo and the decision of the Kosovo Assembly to declare independence on 17 February 2008. At the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 February, EU Foreign Ministers agreed a common response to Kosovo&rsquo;s declaration of independence, noting the uniqueness of Kosovo&rsquo;s situation, arising from the conflict of the 1990s and the eight years of UN administration which followed, and reaffirming the EU&rsquo;s willingness to play a leading role in strengthening stability in the region including by means of the planned ESDP rule of law mission.</P>
        <P>The Council also agreed that Member States will decide, in accordance with national practice and international law, on their relations with Kosovo. Since then, 18 EU Member States, including Ireland, have recognised Kosovo&rsquo;s independence. At least 21 of the 27 EU Member States are expected to recognise Kosovo in the medium term.</P>

	<P>Recent data released by the United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) demonstrate that the global HIV prevalence &mdash; the number of people living with HIV &mdash; has levelled off and that the number of new infections has fallen. This is primarily due to much improved surveillance methodologies, along with some positive impacts of HIV programmes. </P>
        <P>However, in 2007 over 33 million people were still living with HIV. Approximately 2.5 million became newly infected and over 2 million people died of AIDS related illnesses. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the most severely affected region in the world and is home to over 22 million people living with HIV or 68% of the global total. AIDS remains the primary cause of death in Africa. In some of the worst affected countries, AIDS is the biggest cause of <Col N="873"/>death among those under 5 and it is estimated that 15 million children under 18 years have lost one or both parents to AIDS, with the vast majority, 12 million, living in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
        <P>The United Nations and the European Union play a critical role in addressing the main diseases of poverty, including HIV and AIDS through setting global policy, guidance on best practice, providing specialist technical assistance and funding specific interventions aimed at tackling these diseases. Irish Aid supports a range of UN Funds and Programmes as well as the European Commission and Member States in advocating for a sustained and resourced global response to health and HIV and AIDS and strengthened leadership at all levels.</P>
        <P>This year Ireland is playing a leadership role in steering UN reform. The theme &lsquo;Delivering as One&rsquo; provides the opportunity to build a more effective inter-UN agency response to HIV and AIDS. Membership of the Board of UNAIDS this year provides Ireland with the opportunity not only to advocate for increased effectiveness and efficiency within the UN system, but also to advance some of its key priorities including the need for a stronger focus on children and women, and ensuring that health and HIV and AIDS are addressed in the context of humanitarian and emergency situations.</P>
        <P>In June of this year the United Nations General Assembly will debate progress being made to achieve Universal Access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. Ireland has already submitted its report on how it is addressing this global pandemic and will send a high level delegation to advocate for increased political commitment, additional resources and consensus on addressing key obstacles to better health for those most vulnerable and marginalised.</P>
        <P>Ireland has prioritised the needs of children in its work on HIV and AIDS. It is the only country to target 20% of its increased funding to interventions that will benefit children.</P>
        <P>In recognition of Ireland&rsquo;s leadership in this area, we have been requested to host the fourth Global Partners Forum on Children affected by HIV and AIDS. Working in cooperation with UNICEF and scheduled for October, this forum will bring together high level decision makers from both developed and developing countries to debate the best approaches to ensuring the protection of children living in a world with HIV and AIDS.</P>

	<P>I am advised by F&Aacute;S that it is not currently aware of any Community Employment projects in rural areas where supervisors are encountering difficulties in recruiting workers. </P>
        <P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and assists them in enhancing/developing both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April, 2000). Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE <Col N="874"/>based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and people with disabilities may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</P>
        <P>The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  F&Aacute;S makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  F&Aacute;S also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</P>
        <P>In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</P>

	<P>I am aware that on the 20th March, the Financial Regulator issued a public statement drawing attention to false rumours circulating about certain share prices and reminding all those involved in the market of the need to be responsible in their handling of rumours. The Regulator also stated that it was examining the market activity for any signs of market abuse. I understand that work is ongoing and it would therefore not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter. </P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has similar powers to those of all securities regulators across Europe and, I understand, cooperates closely with other regulators to combat market abuse, which is often international in character. The current legislative position with strong powers of investigation and administrative sanctions provides a good framework for effective supervision.</P>

	<P>The special agri-environmental arrangements in the Owenduff/Nephin Beg Special Area of Conservation arise from a judgment of the European Court of Justice in 2002 and are a matter in the first instance for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In November 2006, that Department, in consultation with my Department and local landowners, introduced these measures which included a five-month off-wintering period.  Farmers within this region who were in existing REPS 2 and 3 contracts were paid an extra &euro;2,000 per annum in order to compensate them for additional restrictions imposed upon their farming activities, above and beyond those detailed in their existing REPS contracts.  </P>
        <P>As was noted at a meeting this week between the two Departments, the IFA and a representative group of local sheep farmers, the increased payment rates negotiated with the European Commission for REPS 4 were justified on the basis that they covered the full range of constraints on farming activity that might apply to participating farmers.  There did not therefore appear to be any basis for an additional payment in REPS 4.</P>
        <P>The mixed grazing supplementary measure in REPS 4 is not related to the special agri-environmental arrangements in this area.  It is however available to the farmers in question if they join REPS 4, though it is payable on &ldquo;green&rdquo; land only and not on commonage.</P>

        <P>In a situation where a husband has transferred the landholding to his wife, she may apply for the Scheme provided she is between her 55th and 66th birthday and meets all of the other eligibility criteria, including the requirement to have farmed either solely or with a family member/partner for the ten years prior to the transfer/lease of the lands to the transferee.</P>
        <P>While there is no requirement that she would have to be the owner of the lands for a specific period prior to transfer/lease of the lands to the transferee, it could affect how her application would be classified.  To qualify as a Sole Applicant she would have to be the owner of the pension lands on 31 December in the calendar year prior to the transfer/lease of the lands to the transferee.  The lands would have to be the subject of an SPS/Area Aid application by the applicant/family member/partner at the date of signing of the transfer/lease (with the transferee) or in the year prior to signing.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 to 130, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in rapidly developing areas as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  On the 1st February last I announced the first phase of projects that will commence construction during 2008 and 2009. My announcement included details of the 18 large scale building projects approved for construction and a further 30 primary school projects in rapidly developing areas.  Details of the projects approved can be viewed under the Press Release section of my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to make a further announcement shortly and to provide an update on progress for the new schools planned for September 2008 delivery in developing areas.</P>
        <P>A list of projects, broken down by county, which have now completed the tender process but did not feature in my announcement of the 1st February last is given in the following statement.</P>
        <P>As there is no requirement to report back to my Department on the completion of stage 4, the most reliable information available refers to projects that have stage 3 approval and that have approval to advance to Planning Permission, to prepare Bills of Quantity and to arrange preparation of Tender Documents.  The number of primary and post-primary school projects in that category is 51.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Brian Hayes</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> the number of classes in primary education where children of nine or under are in a class of 30 or more; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Class size data for the school year 2007/2008 are currently being processed and are not yet available.  Class size data by pupil age are not available. </P>
        <P>Schools have flexibility in the way in which they assign pupils and teachers to classes and the Department does not allocate teachers to specific classes or age groups.  The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly.  School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are now in the region of 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002.  By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc.  In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.</P>
        <P>Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.</P>
        <P>A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing <Col N="881"/>large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years in order to reduce class sizes.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>Over 3,000 Summer Works projects were funded by my Department since the introduction of the Scheme in 2004.  With so many smaller scale projects having been funded in the last few years, the Department&rsquo;s intention is to concentrate the investment in school buildings this year on delivering as many large projects as possible. </P>
        <P>While there will be a focus on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also be delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  The emphasis, however, will be on new schools, extensions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, there will not be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of the Department&rsquo;s building programme in 2008.  This being the case, details in relation to applications received, project details and cost have not been collated.  However, I can inform the Deputy that more than 1,000 applications for funding were received.</P>
        <P>I would also advise the Deputy that it is my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.</P>

	<P>Among the priority funding measures approved for support in 2006/2007 under the Educational Disadvantage category of the Dormant Account Fund and the RAPID Leverage Fund, was a scheme addressing educational infrastructure in disadvantaged schools. Eligibility for the scheme was restricted to primary and post primary schools participating in my Department&rsquo;s DEIS programme, schools in, or serving, RAPID areas and special schools.</P>
        <P>The scheme consists of four measures and a number of sub-measures.  The four measures are: Outdoor Play Facilities; Libraries; Parent Rooms; and Dining Areas.  Schools were allowed to submit prioritised proposals under each of the measures.  To date, total of &euro;24.5 million has been made available to fund the scheme.</P>
        <P>Due to the volume of applications received, the assessment process has had to be carried out on a phased basis.  Under previous funding rounds, 447 outdoor play facilities and 146 library enhancement projects have been approved for a total of &euro;11.26 million in grant aid.</P>
        <P>Proposals identified by schools as either their first or second priority under the Parent Room measure, including the proposal referred to by the Deputy, have now been assessed and the applications rated as meriting funding have been determined.  Lower priorities have not been assessed because there is insufficient funding.  Government approval will be sought during May for Parent Room projects valued at approximately &euro;3.5 million in total.  Following approval, my Department will write to the schools concerned to advise them of the outcome of their applications.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department on 12 April 2005.</P>
        <P>On examination of the application it was determined that the person concerned did not meet the statutory residency requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  A letter informing the applicant of this was issued on 13 April 2005.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, does not provide for an appeal against my decision on an application for a certificate of naturalisation. However, the representatives of the person concerned contacted the Citizenship section of my Department on 10 May 2005 requesting that the application be reconsidered, notwithstanding the fact that the person in question did not satisfy the statutory conditions.  My officials responded in a letter dated 22 September 2005 outlining the position once again.</P>
        <P>A new application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Section of this Department on 21 February 2008.</P>
        <P>Officials in that Section inform me that processing of the application has not been examined in detail.  Examination of the residency requirement will take place in the near future and the applicant will be will be contacted at that time informing him when his application will be further examined or of any shortfall in his residency.</P>

	<P>The first named person arrived in the State on 3 July 2003 and applied for asylum.

Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 16 May 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 1 September 1996 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the then Asylum Division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The person concerned appealed this determination to the then Asylum Appeals Unit. This appeal was refused by the relevant Appeals Authority. The person concerned was notified of the refusal of his appeal by letter dated 25 February 1999.</P>
        <P>By letter dated 19 January 2000, the person concerned was informed that the Minister was considering his deportation from the State and advised him of the options open to him at that point in time, to be exercised within a period of 15 working days, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to deportation or to submit written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>Following the consideration of the case of the person concerned under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), a Deportation Order was signed by the Minister in respect of the person concerned on 11 May 2000.  On 28 August 2002, the person concerned applied for residency in the State on the basis of marriage to an Irish citizen. However, following consideration of this application, the application was refused. This decision was conveyed to the person concerned by letter dated 7 July 2004. This communication also advised the person concerned of his options at that point in time, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making fresh representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Further representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned. The Deportation Order issued in respect of the person concerned was revoked on 16 May 2007.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the person concerned was invited to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned submitted an application in accordance with these regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned will be passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 16 September 2001 on a valid visa. His visa expired and he travelled to the United Kingdom. He was returned to Ireland on 25 March 2003 on the basis of a Dublin Convention transfer, and claimed asylum. His application was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and on appeal by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The person concerned was informed by letter dated 14 January, 2005 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why he should not be deported.</P>
        <P>On 17 January 2006, my predecessor refused permission to remain in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post and he presented himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 2nd February 2006 as requested.</P>
        <P>On 14 November 2006 an application for Subsidiary Protection was received on behalf of the applicant from his legal representatives. This application was refused and the legal representatives of the person concerned were notified by post of the decision on 14 December 2006. On 6 February 2007 the legal representatives of the person concerned initiated judicial review proceedings in relation to the refusal of their client&rsquo;s Subsidiary Protection refusal. On 5 November 2007 the legal representatives of the person concerned were given the opportunity to invoke the Minister&rsquo;s discretion under Regulation 4(2). The person concerned and his legal representatives were notified by letter dated 3 April 2008 that I had decided not to exercised my discretion and accept and consider the Subsidiary Protection application. The person concerned was required to present at the Garda National Immigration Bureau, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 10 April 2008 to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. He presented in GNIB on 9 April 2008 and was given a new presentation date of 16 April 2008 to present in Henry Street Garda Station Limerick. He failed to present as requested on this date and is classified as evading his deportation.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Bureau.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.</P>
        <P>While it is not the practice to comment in detail on individual asylum applications, I would point out to the Deputy that delays in finalising cases can occur for a variety of reasons, including giving applicants and appellants the fullest opportunity possible to present their cases <Col N="893"/>and the determination of Judicial Review proceedings, where appellants pursue such a course of action.</P>
        <P>Where the latter is relevant, the time taken to discharge any proceedings is a matter for the Courts and is not something that I, as Minister, can comment on. It is, of course, open to the applicant or the appellant to withdraw any Judicial Review proceedings which they may have instigated and this would allow for their appeal to be processed in the normal manner.</P>
        <P>A final decision on this application will be made upon receipt of the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 21 January 2004 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.

These Proceedings were unsuccessful.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 31 March 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.

In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). To date the person concerned has not submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State.

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision. The RIA currently has a portfolio of 63 centres across 22 counties, accommodating over 6,850 persons representing 96 nationalities.</P>
        <P>By way of background, the Deputy may wish to note that the person referred to in the details supplied applied for asylum on 6 June 2006 along with her spouse. The child referred to was born on 19 September 2006.  Both mother and child are currently being accommodated at the Eyre Powell accommodation centre in Newbridge.  This person&rsquo;s spouse is being accommodated at another centre.</P>
        <P>Both mother and child were provided accommodation in Eyre Powell accommodation centre from 15 June 2007 and were facilitated with a room to themselves from 14 August 2007.</P>
        <P>The correspondence referred to in the details supplied refers to the standard of accommodation being provided to this family at Eyre Powell accommodation centre, although it clearly indicates that the person writing the letter has not seen the accommodation in question. In relation to the standard of accommodation provided in direct provision generally, the Deputy may wish to note that all accommodation providers are required under contract  to ensure that accommodation centres comply and operate in accordance with all statutory requirements of local authorities and State agencies in relation to bedroom capacity, food, food-hygiene, water supply, fire safety and general safety.</P><Col N="901"/>
        <P>The Agency engages independent external assessors to conduct comprehensive inspections of all centres on at least an annual basis.  These inspections are always unannounced and the inspectors look at all aspects of the accommodation centres in relation to the proprietors&rsquo; obligations under the contract.  These inspections cover such areas as reception, staff cover, menus, facilities being provided, maintenance of the property and fire and safety issues.  In addition, the Agency has an internal Inspections Unit which conducts inspections of each of the properties used to accommodate asylum seekers on a twice yearly basis.  Further unannounced visits are made to accommodation centres throughout the State on a regular basis by senior management to ensure that standards are being maintained.  Staff from the Agency hold information clinics on a regular basis in accommodation centres which afford asylum seekers an opportunity to comment on accommodation and operating standards and to discuss other general issues.</P>
        <P>Any diminution in standards which comes to the attention of the RIA is immediately followed up and proprietors are instructed to make any changes and improvements deemed necessary.  Follow-up inspections are also arranged as appropriate.  In cases where standards stipulated in the contract have not been met and the proprietor has not made sufficient efforts to remedy the situation, the contract may be terminated.</P>
        <P>The RIA has made every effort to facilitate this family and is satisfied that the separate accommodation provided at Eyre Powell accommodation centre represents the best solution available within the RIA&rsquo;s portfolio of direct provision accommodation at this time.  Furthermore, it should be noted that the RIA has received no formal application for a transfer from this person.</P>

	<P>I refer to my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 192 of 10 April 2008.  The person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was granted a C visit visa to enter the State for a period of three months for the purpose of a visit only, not to attend college in the State.</P>
        <P>An examination of the papers in relation to the case indicates that the person concerned sought an extension of her C Visit Visa with the Immigration Division of my Department and was refused.</P>
        <P>A wrap-around information sheet accompanies every visa application form.  That sheet makes it clear to the applicant that, in general, persons granted visas for particular purposes are not permitted to remain in the State for any purpose other than that for which the visa was granted.</P>
        <P>Every visa applicant is required to state on the application form the dates on which he or she proposes to enter and leave the State.  He or she is also required to declare that the information supplied is correct and complete.</P>
        <P>A C Visa is granted for visits of less than 90 days. As a consequence it is not the general policy to extend permission to remain to persons who are admitted initially for a period of 90 days or less on a C visit visa, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances.</P>
        <P>The person concerned must leave and reapply from outside the State.  Should she wish to return, she should include in her new visa application the purpose and duration of her intended stay.</P>

	<P>In November 2006, my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, introduced, in consultation with local landowners in the Owenduff/Nephinbeg Special Area of Conservation in County Mayo a series of agri-environmental measures which were required to comply with a judgement of the European Court of Justice in 2002.  These measures included a 5 month off-wintering period to address the damage caused by over-grazing.  Farmers within this region who were in existing REPS 2 and 3 contracts receive an extra payment of &euro;2,000 in order to compensate them for additional costs imposed upon their farming activities, above and beyond those detailed in their existing REPS contracts.</P>
        <P>As was indicated at a meeting earlier this week between the two Departments, the IFA and a representative group of local sheep farmers, the increased payment rates negotiated for REPS 4 were justified to the European Commission by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the basis that they covered the full range of agri-environmental measures and associ<Col N="904"/>ated costs that might apply to participating farmers.  There did not therefore appear to be any basis for an additional payment in REPS 4.</P>

        <P>In considering an appeal, the Board must consider all submissions on the file, together with their own Inspector&rsquo;s report and recommendation, and reach their own conclusion on the matter in line with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area. If they do not follow the recommendations of the Inspector, the Board must be satisfied that the facts of the case support their decision.

	<P>Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans were issued by my Department in June 2007 under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which requires planning authorities to have regard to them in the performance of their functions.  As regards the quantum of land that should be zoned for development, the guidelines emphasise that &ldquo;development plans must be based on objective, needs driven assessment of future development requirements including the amount of land that needs to be zoned for particular purposes&rdquo;.  The guidelines also state that &ldquo;zoning that is not responsive to or justifiable by reference to reasonable needs, <Col N="906"/>or that substantially exceeds such needs, is not consistent with proper planning and sustainable development&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 to 197, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I consider that incineration must always be regarded as disposal.  Its definition as recovery within the proposed revised Waste Framework Directive will, in my view, undermine efforts to promote a recycling society and the promotion of reduction and reuse within the waste hierarchy.  At the June 2007 Environment Council, I made my views known to that effect by entering a statement in the Council minutes along with the Czech Republic, who shared my views on this matter.  Given that there was almost unanimity towards a political agreement at the Council I did not oppose the adoption of a common position at that time.</P>
        <P>I have noted that the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted 80 amendments to the common position at its meeting on 8 April 2008 and that incineration and the waste hierarchy are among the issues where amendments are proposed.  Concerning the waste hierarchy the Parliament wants a general rule rather than a guiding principle to apply and this is something I do not favour.</P>
        <P>Currently, the EU Presidency has a mandate to negotiate towards a second reading agreement with the European Parliament on the basis of particular textual suggestions and plans three Trialogues before the deadline of 16 June 2008, when the Parliament plenary vote is scheduled.  It is therefore premature to take a definitive position on the issue.</P>

	<P>Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the management, conservation, protection and development of the inland fisheries resource rests with the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards.</P>
        <P>A considerable proportion of fisheries boards&rsquo; resources and personnel time is devoted to the habitat improvement and fish stock rehabilitation works.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;35 million has been allocated in my Department&rsquo;s vote for 2008, for Inland Fisheries, including over &euro;31 million for the operations and activities of the Fisheries Boards, including the habitat improvement and fish stock rehabilitation efforts of the Boards.</P>
        <P>In 2007 &euro;1.25m was made available to the Regional Fisheries Boards to enable them to undertake additional river habitat improvement and fish stock rehabilitation, when changes to the salmon management regime were introduced.</P>
        <P>Furthermore a Ministerial Direction under the Fisheries Act 1980, requires the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards to prepare and implement a programme for rehabilitation of salmon stocks, funded by the proceeds of the salmon conservation component of the salmon licence fees.</P>
        <P>I am advised that in 2007 a total of &euro;342,004 was invested by the Regional Fisheries Boards and some &euro;200,000 by the Central Fisheries Board in 2008 from the proceeds of the salmon licence fees for such projects.  Further details of the salmon conservation component funding will be published in the 2007 Annual Report and accounts for the Fisheries Boards.  The proceeds of the licence fees will be similarly allocated in 2008.</P>
