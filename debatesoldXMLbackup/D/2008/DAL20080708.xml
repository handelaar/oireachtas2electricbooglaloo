      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There are 12 non-established civil servants, including contract staff, currently employed in my Department and in my Tullamore constituency office.  Mr. Joe Lennon is my programme <Col N="2"/>manager, and Professor Peter Clinch, Mr. Gerry Steadman, Mr. Brian Murphy and Mr. Declan Ryan are my special advisers.</P>
        <P>Under the direction of the programme manager, the primary function of the special advisers is to monitor, facilitate and help secure the achievement of Government objectives and to ensure effective co-ordination in the implementation of the programme for Government.  They are also tasked with giving me advice and keeping me informed on a wide range of issues, including business, financial, economic, political, environmental, administrative and media matters, and performing such other functions as may be directed by me from time to time.  In addition, several of my advisers have specific responsibilities in regard to speech drafting.  My programme manager meets other ministerial advisers on a weekly basis.  He monitors and reports to me on progress in implementing the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The Government Chief Whip has four non-established civil servants employed in my Department and in his Finglas constituency office.  The two constituency staff are work sharers.  Mr. Padraig Slyne is the special adviser to the Government Chief Whip.</P>
        <P>There is one Government press secretary, Mr. Eoghan &Oacute; Neachtain, and two deputy Government press secretaries, Mr. Mark Costigan and Mr. John Downing.  These are supported by two non-established civil servants.  The Government press secretary and press officers provide an information service on Government policy to the public through the national and international media on behalf of myself, my Department and the Government, together with promoting a co-ordinated approach to media matters across all Departments.  The central task of the deputy Government press secretaries is to assist the Government press secretary in communicating to the media the decisions of Government.</P>
        <P>The personal assistants and personal secretaries in my Department have a range of duties, including providing administrative assistance in the constituency office, the protocol division and the Government Chief Whip&rsquo;s office.  The Green Party programme manager, based in Government Buildings, is not a member of staff of my Department.</P>
        <P>The political advisers in my Department are appointed in accordance with the terms of the Civil Service (Regulation) Act 2006 and the relevant directions of the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>My Department currently employs nine non-established civil servants.  These are its librarian, five UCC students on internships, two temporary clerical officers who are replacing Department staff on term time, and one civilian driver assigned to the Leader of the Seanad.  The librarian in my Department has responsibility for the management of the library and information services in the Department.</P>
        <P>The five UCC students currently on placement in my Department are being given an opportunity to complete the work experience module of the UCC B.Sc. in government and public policy 2008.</P>
        <P>Term-time working provides for leave for the purpose of allowing working parents or primary carers to match their working arrangements to the main summer holidays of their children, or to care for a person who resides with them and who has a disability which gives rise to the need for care on a continuing or frequent basis.  Under this term-time scheme, my Department has taken on two temporary clerical officers on a 15-week contract basis to cover for permanent staff who are availing of term time over the summer months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Taoiseach has arranged a press conference for 3.15 p.m., immediately after Taoiseach&rsquo;s Questions, at which he intends to announce the decisions that were made by the Government this morning with regard to the state of the public finances and the economy.  As regards the questions currently before him, will he tell the <Col N="3"/>House if the Government has made any decision concerning the restriction or embargo on employment, or any limitation on recruitment or employment of public or civil servants?  Second, has the Government made any decision with regard to the replacement of public servants who leave?  Third, has the Government made any decision with regard to the pay and remuneration of public servants?  How will the decisions made this morning apply to the categories of staff covered by the three questions he is now answering?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government concluded its meeting a short time ago.  As a matter of courtesy a statement or press release will be laid before the House at 3.30 p.m. at the same time as I am having a press conference with the Minister for Finance.  The question of how we deal with pay issues going forward is a critical matter.  From my point of view, the staff referred to in these questions are unaffected, in specific terms, as regards any decisions that are to be announced concerning those matters.  Specifically, however, special advisers act under the various guidelines that are set out for remuneration and they are adhered to in this respect.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I return to my Question No. 1, which refers to non-established civil servants and contract staff.  Question No. 2 refers to special political advisers or other staff employed by the Taoiseach, his Ministers of State and his Department.  The latter question specifically asks if changes are planned in respect of those personnel.  The Taoiseach has effectively confirmed that the Government has made decisions this morning concerning the employment, recruitment, replacement, pay and conditions of public servants generally.  What are those decisions?  They clearly concern the staff which are the subject of these questions.  My question specifically asks about changes in regard to those personnel. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>These questions relate to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot broaden it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.  The Government has made decisions this morning and I am asking the Taoiseach if he will tell the House what decisions have been made about staff recruitment, replacement and pay, since those decisions clearly concern staff which are the subject of these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not concern the staff referred to in these questions.  These non-established civil servants, including contract staff and political advisers, remain in place for the duration of my tenure.  Their tenure ends whenever my tenure ends.</P>
        <P>We will be having a press conference today at 3.30 p.m. on the decisions made by the Government.  The press release will be laid before the House and there will be an opportunity at 4.15 p.m. to discuss it further.  There will then be a nine hour debate on the economy over Wednesday and Thursday.  The Government is preparing the press release at present, based on decisions which have just been made.</P>
        <P>The specific personnel mentioned in the questions are governed by the guidelines that apply to special advisers under the Public Service Management Act 1997.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Taoiseach say that there are five interns from UCC working in his Department?  I did not hear him clearly.  Is there a specific reason the students are from UCC, as distinct from other colleges, or is there some kind of rota?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a work experience module in a degree programme of that university, known as the bachelor of science in government and public policy.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="4"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not apply to other universities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I was just making the point that they are in my Department.  They are not answering to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand that.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that there is now a freeze in the appointment of further political advisers?  I know that the Taoiseach has taken on an eminent professor of economics who deals with emissions.  Does this mean that he is now effectively removing control of the climate change area from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  He never attends this House anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with that.  In addition to providing policy advice on economic and other areas, Professor Clinch advises me on the process of integrating policies across different Departments, in anticipation of the challenges posed by the international environmental policy agenda.  He has a level of expertise in this area, but also in economics generally.  His particular expertise is an indication of the priority that we attach to the issue, as it assists us to meet a challenging agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise that it is a challenge and I am aware of his expertise.  I just assumed that the Taoiseach felt he needed to get a hold of the issue in his own Department, which would explain the professor&rsquo;s appointment.  Is there now a freeze on the appointment of political advisers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No appointments are contemplated at the moment, but we would leave open the possibility of taking advice for whatever length of time, either formally or informally.  Professor Clinch brings a level of expertise to an important area, which is how to integrate policies across different Departments in order to develop economic efficiency, environmental sustainability and the general question of energy security.  This is a major issue for Ireland, Europe and the wider world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>From the Taoiseach&rsquo;s replies, it seems the categories of special political adviser, contract staff and non-established civil servants, who are mainly employed for political purposes, will be exempt from the Government&rsquo;s decision today on the recruitment and replacement of staff in the public service.  Is that what the Taoiseach&rsquo;s replies to the House indicate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, that would not be a correct understanding of my reply.  I simply wish to make the point that it is open to an incumbent Taoiseach to employ advice as required.  As I said in my response, I do not contemplate further advisers in the immediate term, based on the advice I have at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister sitting beside the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, states that her Department is becoming more important as a safety net for the quarter of a million people who will be on the dole by Christmas and decides she needs another political adviser, when the Taoiseach says such an appointment is not contemplated, does this mean it is not ruled out?  With reference to what Deputy Gilmore said, is the category of political adviser exempt from any proposed embargo or freeze or reduction in numbers being contemplated by the Government in respect of the current situation?  If a Minister or Minister of State wants to take on another political adviser to help to deal with the wrath of the public, will the Taoiseach sanction such an appointment or will he decide the Government needs to show good example and there will be no more recruitment of political advisers during his term?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="5"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am simply saying that everyone will comply with the existing guidelines.  There is no requirement for Ministers to need any further advisers beyond those they already have, based on the current regulations and guidelines.  The Department of the Taoiseach has the opportunity, should it be required or necessary, for the Taoiseach to provide himself with advice as Head of Government.  As I outlined in a previous reply, I do not contemplate changing the present arrangements in the foreseeable future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to concentrate on the position from today onwards.  I understand from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s responses to the questions that if he or any of his Ministers is of a mind to employ additional political advice or additional staff in their offices, they are free to do so and that whatever decisions have been made by the Government, do not apply to the employment of staff in ministerial offices or in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.</P>
        <P>What is the position from today onwards with regard to the replacement of the categories of staff to which I have referred?  If one of those staff leaves, will he or she be replaced or is there an embargo or restriction on the replacement of such staff, particularly arising from whatever decisions the Taoiseach has made today and which he is not prepared to share with the House just now anyway?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are regulations in place as to the number of staff Ministers are allowed and these must be complied with.  Staff are provided on the basis of need and for the provision of whatever advice is required.  Under the Public Service Management Act, that restriction does not apply in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office, although as I have said, I do not contemplate increasing the number of advisers I have.  </P>
        <P>The Government has just made decisions which we are currently preparing to bring to public attention and as a result I cannot share them with the House at this moment.  The question will be to deal with these matters in a practical and sensible way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We must be the only Parliament in the world where Government makes a decision and the Head of the Government will not tell the House what that decision is until he goes out to a press conference to tell them first.  However, I will leave that aside.  My question relates to the special advisers, contract staff and non-established civil servants, who work in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, many of them involved in political duties.  The Taoiseach told the House the number of staff who are currently employed.  Is the Taoiseach saying this number will not increase beyond today?  If one of those staff from any of those categories, leaves, will he or she be replaced?  Does the Government&rsquo;s decision today affect this in any way?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer the question again for Deputy Gilmore &mdash; I am not trying to be problematic &mdash; I do not contemplate a situation in which more staff are required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not asking what the Taoiseach is contemplating.  I am looking for facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On an individual retiring from the present complement, it will be a matter for decision by me whether a replacement would be required.  It will depend on the circumstances.  The issue is to ensure we comply with the regulations set out in the Public Service Management Act 1997.  I recall the first political party to insist on special advisers was the good Labour Party itself when it came into office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will cut back on nurses though.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The history lecture is not necessary.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="6"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I will pursue the question another way.  I appreciate the Taoiseach may be becoming a bit weary of the questioning.  If he answered it, however, we could move off from it.</P>
        <P>Does this mean that from today there is no embargo on the recruitment of political advisers and contract staff in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department and other ministerial offices?  Does this mean there is no restriction on replacement of adviser and contract staff?  The Taoiseach said several times that if he contemplated he needed more advisers, there is no restriction on increasing the number of such staff in his office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a limit on the number of advisers a Minister can have, and that is being complied with.  Under the Public Service Management Act no such restrictions on the number of special advisers to the Department of the Taoiseach apply.  However, I do not intend in the foreseeable future to provide for any further advisers.  On the question of should a replacement be required if someone retires or resigns, it can be considered on its merits but I would be mindful of the overall situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does this refer to the further recruitment of consultants?  Are we to be faced with a raft of consultants doing work on an hourly basis for Ministers and the Government over the next 12 months?  Has the Taoiseach decided to use the resources of the public service and the expertise within it?  Does the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply allow him to employ a raft of consultants between now and next year?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach referred to the press conference at 3.30 p.m. that he will hold with the Minister for Finance and the subsequent statements to the House.  Will this spell out all the decisions made at Cabinet this morning?  Will we have to wait until each individual Minister gives a statement over the next several days?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has referred to this several times already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question refers to the non-established civil servants, contract staff and political advisers in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It refers to public service numbers, the recruitment of political advisers and consultants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the Government&rsquo;s intention to employ a raft of consultants on an hourly basis.  The Government intends to use the resources available to the State within Departments, and outside them when appropriate, to ensure the right decisions are made for the country.  That has been a feature of every Government in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When Deputy Martin was Minister for Health and Children, he had 20 advisers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been my intention for the House to debate the actions to be taken by the Government to deal with the current economic situation.  I do not intend to defer decisions until after the House goes into recess.  The Cabinet meeting ended not so long ago and the press release has been prepared.  When the press conference is held, the press release will be made available to the House at the same time.  There will be an opportunity at 4.15 p.m. for some questions to be asked, and there will be a debate for nine hours.  There will be an opportunity for everyone to come into the House and for the position to be explained to the House, in so far as possible.  No more open or detailed way can be found to do this apart from that <Col N="7"/>outlined in the interests of communicating to everyone and having a debate on the issues as they arise.  The Government is being as open as it possibly can be. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has said that if a member of the staff leaves, he will make a decision as to whether he or she will be replaced.  Similarly, if he believes at some stage that he wants to add to the number of staff, he can do so.  Will the same rule apply to every other Department and every other section of the public sector?  Will all managers in the public sector have the same latitude the Taoiseach described, or is this just an arrangement for himself? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I am making is that under the Public Service Management Act certain issues arise in respect of advice to the Department of the Taoiseach, which are specific.  As regards the general point, we shall be outlining the position at 3.30 p.m. and subsequently the general approach the Government wishes to take in control of public expenditure going forward, including the question of staff costs. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>How can we be sure the decisions the Cabinet has made this morning will actually be implemented?  The Taoiseach has just said the Government will employ whatever expertise it believes is necessary in order to make the best decisions for the country.  I respect that, as I do the Taoiseach&rsquo;s willingness to have a debate in the House, which is only right and proper as this is the forum of the people. </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s successor as Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, produced 120 consultant reports at great public expense, very few of which were ever implemented.  In the report on the national development plan produced just recently by the Minister for Finance, there is a &euro;251 million underspend in the energy programme.  When the press release is issued at 3.30 p.m., how can the Taoiseach guarantee the decisions made by the Cabinet will actually follow through, because there are innumerable examples in this programme, and others, where money allocated by the Government to various sectors, whether mental health, suicide prevention or whatever, have never actually been implemented?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny should be aware we are dealing with unestablished civil servants, contract staff and advisers in the Department of the Taoiseach. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The questions are also about consultants, which I asked about, and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must hear the other questions, as regards consultants, yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle always had a big thing about consultants and knows I should ask these questions.  He often encouraged me to ask questions about that in a previous existence. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy I do not encourage him. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will a minimum number of consultants be employed by Government from here on, if they have to be employed at all? </P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the annual report, referred to by the Deputy, obviously it is in the context of the National Development Plan 2007-13.  The overall spend contemplated for the national development plan was, in the main, delivered upon and expended upon those items, broadly speaking, as planned.  Due to the multi-annual nature of allocations, timing issues come into play as regards some headings.  Some contracts are sent out sooner than would have <Col N="8"/>been anticipated, while others will take longer.  This reflects the normal changes in the matrix one might expect for that level of expenditure.  In fairness, it indicates the fact that the national development plan&rsquo;s efforts to integrate across its broad strategic headings, applying investment as planned, actually took place in 2006, as reported in 2007.  The big challenge, going into 2008-09, is the extent to which we can adapt circumstances to continue to meet the strategic priorities and to prioritise.  Also, we must ensure our public finances are put on a sustainable basis.  What the Cabinet did today is the first phase in that effort to ensure that, in respect of the spending we anticipated for this year, our spending limits will be adhered to, given that our tax returns will be down.  It is important to do that based on the knowledge we have and to prepare for the Estimates round and the budgetary position for 2009, outlining the challenging position we will face to get through 2009.  There is a process here of engagement and decisions being taken by Government to take account of the changed environment in which we now find ourselves economically.  The Government is being genuine in its efforts to come to the House as soon as possible thereafter and to have a full debate on the issues so that the full House can give its views.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Government is facing the inevitable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair enough if that is the Deputy&rsquo;s view, but the Exchequer returns officially came out last week, we discuss those in Cabinet this week and then we will come to the House with a detailed outline of how we see the position currently and how we see it progressing from here.  That is a fair assessment of the situation from the Government&rsquo;s perspective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The bottom line appears to be that, whatever the Government decided today with regard to limitations on staffing in the public sector, it does not apply to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office, Ministers&rsquo; offices, political advisers and the whole array of political staff employed by the Taoiseach and his Ministers. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Once again, that is not a fair or true assessment of the situation.  I outlined the position very clearly.  We do not intend to increase the number of advisers to Ministers as they have their complement.  In regard to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office, I outlined the legal position.  I also told the Deputy what I am contemplating, that I do not expect that any further adviser will be required in the foreseeable future.  I cannot be any more straightforward than that.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 15, inclusive, together.       </P>
        <P>Although the titles of the Cabinet committees dealing with social inclusion issues have changed slightly, there have been 16 meetings of the Cabinet committee responsible for this area in the past three years, most recently in February 2008.</P>
        <P>To date, the Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security has met on two occasions since the Government was formed and I attended both meetings.  The cross-departmental team on housing, infrastructure and PPPs last met on 1 July 2008 and the date of its next meeting is not yet confirmed.  The role of the cross-departmental team is to assist in progressing and resolving issues related to infrastructure planning and delivery, ensuring that they are adequately prepared for consideration by the Cabinet committee on housing, infrastructure and PPPs and, where necessary, by the Government.</P>
        <P>Questions about the business conducted at Cabinet committee or cross-departmental team meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government.  Questions about the topics of housing, infrastructure, PPPs and so on should be directed to the responsible Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask the Taoiseach specifically about the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure.  Has the Government decided to drop or defer the metro north project and, if so, will the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure deal with that Government decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No such decision has been made by Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach take back his statement of 10 April that he was not concerned about the downturn in the construction sector?  Has the cross-departmental team on housing met and reviewed the position whereby the Government was very ill-prepared for the <Col N="10"/>sudden downturn in the construction industry with devastating consequences for 100,000 young couples who now face negative equity and so on?  Furthermore, has the cross-departmental team on housing considered the proposals put forward by Deputy Hogan and the Fine Gael Party to free up equity to enable couples to purchase houses now that they are at a deflated price and thereby kick-start some elements of the construction industry again?  Has the departmental team considered this area of activity and how best it might be given some stimulus?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware that the cross-departmental team has considered Deputy Hogan&rsquo;s proposals on these matters.  Regarding the questions on the construction industry, I do not know what quote the Deputy referred to on 10 April, but the point I would make in that context is that it was clear the construction industry could not continue to constitute 12% of total output every year.  We have had a correction that had to take place and is taking place.  Unfortunately, the credit squeeze is undermining confidence and that is affecting the output one would have hoped for this year.  Some of that is offset by the increased public capital programme the Government has conducted this year and last year.  We will continue to see how we can assist in that matter with the hope that the construction industry and confidence in the residential housing market will return as soon as possible to more sustainable output levels, which is estimated at between 55,000 and 60,000 per year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security, which the Taoiseach chairs, would he consider appointing one of his Ministers of State to follow up on the various targets being set for this country and ensure that there is greater co-ordination between Departments?  There are the Kyoto targets we have to achieve before 2012, the national climate change strategy set by the Government of 3% reduction per annum and we are now facing other cuts coming down the line from the EU of at least 20%.</P>
        <P>All this will involve major co-operation between various Departments, including the Departments of Transport, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  If we do not achieve these targets, it will cost the State a considerable sum of money.  I ask the Taoiseach to put somebody in charge of co-ordinating all the various activities of different Departments to ensure we reach these targets.  As Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, of which Deputy McManus is a member, we are at sea.  Nobody seems to know what targets are being achieved.  I urge the Taoiseach to consider strongly appointing one of his 20 Ministers of State to look into this matter and work from his Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cabinet sub-committee provides the co-ordinating mechanism for all the Departments that have an interest or contribution to make in this area to meet and try to bring together a coherent policy position.  As Deputy Barrett said, this is a complex and challenging area in which the Government is very closely involved with the Commission in view of the recent documentation and objectives it outlined in recent months.  That is continuing and we are looking at options within and between Departments to continue that work and see how Ireland can try to meet very significant challenges, as Deputy Barrett said.</P>
        <P>The emissions trading scheme is part of the Kyoto arrangements and the need to see how that can contribute is a very legitimate part of any country&rsquo;s efforts to meet the obligations and requirements imposed on it.  In the two or three meetings the sub-committee has had since I became Taoiseach there has been a very significant drive regarding working across Departments to meet the requirements we are discussing at European Commission level.  We must try to accommodate what is being asked of us and marry it with continuing economic growth and progress.  These are big issues and I have taken specific advice in my Department on it.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="11"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for telling the House the metro north project is going ahead as planned.  That is what I understood from his answer and if he wants to correct that, I am happy to hear what he has to say.  Will the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure be asked to consider any other changes to the infrastructure programme arising from the decisions made at today&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the cross-departmental committee on housing infrastructure and public private partnerships discussed the disastrous collapse of the public private partnership for the refurbishment of local authority flat complexes in Dublin city in particular?  Will the Government now fund the local authority to allow it to complete those projects?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Dublin City Council has made some decisions in recent days on that matter, which are to be welcomed.  Obviously we will do all we can to facilitate those projects proceeding as quickly as possible, despite the setbacks that have occurred.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Gilmore, the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure will continue to meet and a meeting is fixed for later this week.  It is continuing to review the annual report of the NDP, published recently, which confirms that a lot of the work as envisaged is taking place.  A lot of major work is being conducted.  On the previous project about which the Deputy asked, I answered his question.  He suggested that a decision had been made or rather he seemed to suggest that he had knowledge of a decision made to cancel metro north and I clarified that that was not a correct perception.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>To return to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement of 10 April last, he said that he was not worried about the downturn in the construction sector.  Then he said a correction was taking place.  That correction has had a devastating impact on the entire country and the loss of confidence is now palpable on the streets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Does the Taoiseach chair the cross-departmental committee on infrastructure, as his predecessor did, and does he sit in on the meetings of the cross-departmental committee on housing?  Given that the Taoiseach was in the Department of Finance, he would have known that an economy based on the building of 80,000 to 90,000 housing units was not sustainable.  We now have a situation where over 100,000 houses are empty, while the need, particularly among young people, to acquire a home or have access to acquiring same is of critical importance.  In that context, has the committee on housing examined the options to expedite a transfer of suitable housing to enable people within a certain range to acquire a home?  It must examine the options available because this is a major issue in all parts of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security and usually there is not one line Minister with which the committee deals.  It is quite clear that when it comes to a global agreement, following on Bali, it will be Heads of Government who will reach such an agreement.  The Taoiseach is chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee on climate change.  If, as I wish, the joint committee invited the Taoiseach to come before it to discuss the issue of climate change, would he be willing to accept that invitation?  It seems that unless we have leadership from the top on this defining issue of our generation, as it has been described by all and sundry, we will not reach the targets that are being set.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Deputy McManus, these are matters for the Oireachtas and for me to consider should such an invitation come.  I have indicated the seriousness of the Government&rsquo;s intent by reason of the fact that the Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security has met on a number of occasions, is engaged on the issue and is trying to devise strategies that will help us to meet our challenging commitments while not damaging the economy.  We are intent on finding solutions that are practical and that meet the require<Col N="12"/>ments of the situation.  As I said, I have taken a special advisor in that area as an indication of the seriousness of our intent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that a definite maybe?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question, he again paraphrased me incorrectly.  I have made the point that in respect of the construction industry, the question of it being able to maintain 12% of output was not sustainable.  That correction is taking place.  What we and the Cabinet sub-committee on housing, infrastructure and PPPs, which is meeting this week, will continue to do is to see in what way Government can assist the situation and bring back market conditions as quickly as possible that will see output rise again.</P>

        <Quest>  the action he proposes to take to address gangland violence and murders, with particular reference to Dublin.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government attaches the highest priority to combating organised crime and bringing those involved in such activities and who show such callous disregard for human life to justice.  One of the main priorities set for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act is to target gun crime, organised crime and drug trafficking through a range of measures, including the use of Garda specialist units and targeted operations such as Operation Anvil.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na meets this task by strategic actions including, in particular, continuous and intensive intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in such illegal activity.  Available intelligence is fully analysed and used in the strategic deployment of both local and specialised operational Garda units in targeting persons and groups.  It is used in carrying out searches and arrests aimed at both preventing attacks and apprehending persons suspected of being involved in such attacks.  Profiles regarding the personnel of organised criminal gangs are continually updated.</P>
        <P>Both uniformed and plain clothes Garda patrols and checkpoints have been increased in areas where it is considered likely such attacks might take place.  In recent months, action has been focused on particular individuals.  Search operations have taken place with the aim of identifying the sources of devices, such as pipe bombs, being used.  A quantity of such devices have been seized and a number of persons have been arrested and charged.  These persons are currently before the courts.  Firearms and drugs have also been recovered resulting in the arrest and charging of persons suspected of being significantly involved in such criminality.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has established on a permanent basis the organised crime unit with the specific objective of targeting those suspected of involvement in organised crime, including drug trafficking, importation, sale and supply.  Similar operations are undertaken by Garda specialist units, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin metropolitan region in May 2005 to deal with this type of serious crime and was extended nationwide in 2006.  The primary aim of the operation is <Col N="13"/>the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt and visible policing and patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols supported by armed plain clothes patrols.</P>
       <?oasys _cl14- ?><P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Garda Commissioner is committed to the objectives of Operation Anvil.  An allocation of &euro;20 million has been ring fenced in the Garda budget for 2008 to ensure its continuing effectiveness, augmented by other initiatives, both local and national.  There is no point in underestimating the difficulties faced by garda&iacute; in counteracting this threat but they have the full support of the Government and, I am sure, all Members of this House in continuing to take relentless action against all those involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the Minister expresses concern about this matter.  However, in doing so, I say to him that the time has come to express more than concern.  The situation is deteriorating quite rapidly.  This year alone, there were over 100 shootings in the city of Dublin, which have been accompanied by 40 bomb attacks.  As recently as last weekend, a grenade attack on a private house took place.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister explain how organisations such as the INLA have been able to thrive in Dublin to the extent they have in recent times, along with other perhaps more orthodox criminal gangs, and why appropriate action has not been taken to bring these people to justice and stop this litany of bombing, grenades and shootings of record proportions?</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="2" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concern of all Oireachtas Members and the reasonable members of the public.  The Garda Commissioner has stated he has more than enough resources to target this.  Operation Anvil is specifically targeted at this type of crime and resources will continue to be made available.  There has been a reduction in the past number of years in the number of murders with firearms.  No one wants any murder but in the first part of this year four people have been murdered, as opposed to six in the same period of the previous year.  We cannot be complacent about this.  On a daily basis I involve myself in discussions with the Garda Commissioner to ensure he has the proper resources targeted at the proper areas in Dublin and elsewhere around the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding firearms, the recently announced proliferation of handguns is totally unacceptable.  We have had 1,600 more handguns licensed last year.  The Minister expresses his acknowledgement and thanks to a High Court judge for reminding him of that situation.  Could I remind him that we had drawn his attention to that by way of parliamentary question on 28 May and 17 June, to which we received very little by way of positive response?  How is it that people are leaving this city on a fairly regular basis for cities such as Prague in the Czech Republic to receive firearms training and returning to engage in the use of firearms on a regular basis?  What is the Minister doing about this?  We have put this question to the Minister in the past, and to his predecessor.  Where are the targets, the results and the strategy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding firearms, I did not need reminding by the judge or the Fine Gael Party because it was one of the issues I targeted when I became Minister a number of months ago.  This is a serious issue and there has been a dramatic rise in the number of licences issued.  Prior to this weekend, I intend to bring forward a technical decision because of some court decisions on the interpretation of the recent Act and regulations.  There needs to a tightening up because we need to bring this legislation together to ensure there is no further proliferation of these firearms.</P>

        <P>The casino regulation committee completed its report in April 2007.  It is a lengthy document that deals with a range of complex and inter-related public policy issues including Internet gambling.  Neither the Government nor I have adopted any views on the report.  Indeed, because the report in question makes recommendations that have significant public policy implications, it was clear that it would require further detailed analysis before Government could be asked to make a formal decision on introducing any new regulatory regime for the gaming area.</P>
        <P>My predecessor had proposed publishing the report of the casino committee &mdash; Regulating Gaming in Ireland &mdash; in conjunction with the establishment of an informal cross-party committee to examine that report and the wider aspects of gaming and gambling.  The report is ready for publication but, like my predecessor, I consider that this is an area where cross-party consensus would be not only desirable from the outset but would help in mapping the way forward so that the interests of all elements in our society are taken into account from the beginning in an area of important public policy.  This is important because there are widely diverging views held on this subject not just between parties, but within parties in this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My aim is to ensure that gaming activities are carried out within a responsible framework that recognises the reality of those activities, the changed environment within which these activities now take place, including on the Internet, but which also ensures that they are properly and responsibly managed, particularly as far as those who may experience problems as a result of their participation in gaming activities are concerned.</P>
        <P>My clear preference is to proceed on the basis of agreement to establish a cross-party committee and to publish the report within the framework of that committee.  However, due to the delay in establishing the informal cross-party committee I have decided to go ahead with the publication of the casino regulation committee report &mdash; Regulating Gaming in Ireland &mdash; imminently in advance of finalisation of the informal cross-party committee.  I welcome all observations on the report.  As it is still my intention to proceed with the establishment of the committee the invitation to the Labour Party for a representative to participate on the committee remains open.  This approach presents an opportunity to Members of the Oireachtas to contribute, at the important policy formulation stage, to the future architecture of gaming.  This is the best way forward.</P>

	<P>Why does the Minister want the cover of an all-party committee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This report refers to an important policy area.  The Oireachtas has not addressed it since 1956.  There has been little legislative change in this area.  The Oireachtas has passed it off.  There were a number of reports during the time when Deputy Rabbitte was in government, including an unpublished task force report on the casino issue while Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn was Minister for Finance.  The Government decided not to proceed.</P><Col N="15"/>
        <P>This is a substantial report and I will publish it within the next week or so.  The all-party committee would be a way of coming to some consensus on the way in which we can manage gaming and betting while giving people an opportunity to examine the negative aspects of the proliferation of Internet gambling, for example.  While the Government can take a view on it, it is better that it is handled on an all-party basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a great many matters that have not been legislated for for a long time and where the law is out of date but the Minister does not come to the Opposition asking for its support and views in respect of these.  What does &ldquo;imminently&rdquo; mean?  The Minister has had the report since April 2007 and is now choosing to publish it as soon as the House rises.  Does the Minister agree with his predecessor who said, in response to Deputy Charles Flanagan: &ldquo;Any report should be matched on publication with definitive Government proposals for the implementation of the recommendations in it.&rdquo;?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree it is urgent that the casino sector is regulated and that responsible operators of medium-sized casinos have been seeking this for a long time?  It is desirable that they should be so regulated.  If the Minister is publishing the report, what does it say about fixed odds betting terminals?  What is the attitude of the Minister to that subject?</P>

	<P>Perhaps that is a good thing, perhaps it is better that I am not an expert.</P>
        <P>Regarding fixed odds betting terminals, I am very concerned about their implementation based on what I have read about them.  Looking at the experience in the UK, particularly the research on the effect on people, it would be a serious move to implement them in Ireland.  By and large, the report comes down against the implementation of them.  I will publish the report some day this week.  I do not in any way intend to show disrespect to the House by publishing it.  We corresponded recently on this matter and the Deputy made a valid point that neither he nor his party has made a judgment on whether it wishes to participate in the committee until the report has been seen.  This is a valid point.  I will publish the report and he can make&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I should think so, yes.  I do not necessarily agree with my predecessor on bringing forward reports and us then dictating.  It will depend on the circumstances.  This area is complex and a great deal of analysis is required of the negative aspects of gaming and the proliferation of gaming and betting opportunities which exist.  At the same time, we must understand this is a substantial industry employing 20,000 people.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  the steps he is taking to address the widespread availability of illegal drugs here.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[27209/08]</QRef>
      </Qst><Col N="16"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the seizure last night, as part of a planned operation, of what is estimated to be &euro;4 million worth of heroin.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s remit in this area, as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall national drugs strategy, while not exclusively, is primarily in the area of drug supply reduction and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government&rsquo;s drug policy framework.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na invokes a number of broad strategic responses in addressing the issue.  These include identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within the State; conducting intelligence-driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade, including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing; working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs trade; and working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.</P>
        <P>In implementing these strategies, the Garda national drugs unit will continue to co-ordinate large scale operations against drug dealing and trafficking with the unit personnel investigating cases themselves and assisting local investigation teams as appropriate.  Additional assistance will continue to be made available from other specialised Garda support units, such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that in addition to the considerable volumes of drugs continuing to be seized, significant impact has been made over the past 18 months by arresting and prosecuting a number of major players involved in drug trafficking through the importation, sale and distribution of drugs.  A significant number of crime gangs involved in this type of criminal activity have been disrupted and dismantled.</P>
        <P>Drug seizures this year to date include more than &euro;20 million worth of heroin and &euro;7.2 million worth of cocaine.  I warmly commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard.  Of its nature this work has to be ongoing and relentless.</P>
        <P>Paradoxically, while increases in the number of drug seizures lead to an increased crime rate as demonstrated, for example, in the most recent CSO crime statistics which show an increase year on year of 31% in detections of controlled drug offences, such seizures are in fact to be welcomed as evidence of increased enforcement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with the Minister in acknowledging the success of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in seizing &euro;4 million worth of heroin last night.  However, if such a seizure took place five years ago it would have meant a shortage of heroin on the streets.  This did not happen because it was the tip of the iceberg such is the problem and the difficulties involved.</P>
        <P>As far as cocaine is concerned, this week the Minister will have seen a report which states three times the amount of cocaine is on the streets now compared to five years ago.  The Minister mentioned supply reduction in his reply.  The Government is failing abysmally.  While the amount of drugs on our streets has increased to record proportions, our ports are manned by one x-ray scanner and surveillance equipment for our seas amounts to one boat.</P>
        <P>What is the story with the second mobile x-ray scanner?  Does the Minister accept what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appears to accept, which is that criminal gangsters are aware that the mobile scanner is in Cork and will use a ferry port in Wexford or Dublin to bring their illicit consignment into the State?  I was informed by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor that a second scanner was on the way.  Where is it?</P>
        <P>What steps has the Department taken in conjunction with customs officials to ensure a second coast guard boat can be acquired?  It is unacceptable and impossible for 4,000 km of <Col N="17"/>Irish coastline to be guarded by a solitary boat.  What steps has the Minister taken to deal with this issue since he took office?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the fact that we have a large coastline, most detection which takes place is intelligence based and comes through working with other law enforcement agencies.  We have been successful in this respect and last night&rsquo;s seizure shows this is the case.</P>
        <P>In the context of working with our international partners, recently Ireland agreed to participate in the Maritime Analysis and Operation Centre, MAOC.  Its aim is to prevent narcotics coming from across the Atlantic and is geared towards the importation of cocaine into Europe.  This is a new initiative and Ireland will be represented at its base in Lisbon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The number of seizures has increased and this is an indication that the policy is working.  With regard to the equipment referred to by Deputy Flanagan, such as x-ray machines, the responsibility lies with the customs service which is in the process of tendering for a new cutter which will be available in 2009.  Customs service personnel are present all the time at every medium and large port.  A major attack by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the customs service has been made on the new aerodromes which have sprung up throughout the country.  They were targeted in 2007 and this will continue.  The vast majority of assistance in this respect comes through good intelligence and this has been shown in the dramatic increase in the number of seizures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret we do not have sufficient time to probe the matter of aerodromes in a meaningful manner.  Does the Minister accept a report published in February this year which states that seven aerodromes frequented by aeroplanes of international origin have not been inspected or had a visitation by anyone in the customs service?  The situation in our private airports, airstrips and aerodromes is farcical.  The Minister stated this was prioritised but this is simply not the case.  Will the Minister concede that airstrips and aerodromes have not been inspected?  How can we expect to have a war on drugs or make progress if our coastline is virtually unguarded as we have only one scanner and one ship and our aerodromes are not inspected?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In this regard, for the most part, our law enforcement agencies, whether the customs service or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, operate through good intelligence.  To my knowledge, the customs service has visited as many aerodromes as necessary, given the type of intelligence it received.  I expect it will continue to do so.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of a secure digital radio service for the Garda is well under way.  Following the completion of a pilot digital radio project by the Garda authorities, a decision was taken to procure a single nationwide digital radio service for use by the Garda authorities, other emergency services and non-commercial State bodies.  This enables economies of scale as well as allowing for inter-agency communication in the event of major incidents or cross agency operations.  Following completion of the tender processes by the Department of Finance, a preferred bidder, TETRA Ireland Limited, was selected.  A service performance evaluation covering a significant part of the Dublin metropolitan region and surrounds, including Dublin Port and the airport, was satisfactorily completed late last year to ensure the pre<Col N="18"/>ferred bidder demonstrates its capability to deliver this key service for the emergency services, both from a technical and organisational perspective.</P>
        <P>In parallel with the performance evaluation, detailed and intensive contract negotiations took place between the Department of Finance and the preferred bidder and the contract was signed on 1 May this year.  Roll-out of the required infrastructure by TETRA Ireland has progressed well since the exchange of contracts.  Significant additional resources were provided for in the Garda Vote this year and this will be used for the purchase of the necessary equipment such as hand-held radio equipment, radios for Garda vehicles, despatch equipment etc.  As the contract is based on a managed service model, annual usage charges will apply and, therefore, there is no major up-front capital investment by the State in the provision of the network.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda project team is continuing with preparatory and planning work to progress the project work-streams and meet migration and roll-out milestones.  I am further advised that this preparation and planning by the Garda authorities is well advanced and implementation will closely follow the roll-out of the infrastructure by the preferred bidder.  The entire nationwide roll-out is expected to be completed over a two-year period.  Until roll-out of the new system is complete, Garda authorities will continue to maintain their existing radio infrastructure, including the digital radio system servicing significant parts of the Dublin metropolitan region, and its analogue systems throughout the country.  I assure the Deputy that the provision of a new secure radio service for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as soon as possible remains a priority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>If I used the word &ldquo;farce&rdquo; in response to a previous reply given by the Minister, I must use the words &ldquo;monumental fiasco&rdquo; to describe this issue.  We are waiting ten years for the digital radio system.  Earlier this year, the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor engaged in a fine public relations stunt called the signing of the contract.  I was present at the Garda conference when much was made of the announcement to exceed all announcements that this system was on the way, the contract had been completed and nothing would stand in the way after ten years in the delivery of this vital infrastructural equipment for the Garda in the fight against crime, with which I am sure the Minister will agree.</P>
        <P>Neither the Minister nor any official in his Department factored in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and ComReg in this issue.  The signing of the contract and the agreement with TETRA Ireland Limited are all very fine except that this process has come to a complete standstill because ComReg has not given its consent and the service cannot proceed without the issue of the licence by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  What is happening in regard to this issue?  How can we have a situation where another public relations stunt takes place and contracts are signed but the Minister replies that the service will be provided &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;?  What does he mean by that?</P>

	<P>There is a misapprehension regarding the signing of the contract and the application to ComReg.

        <Quest>  if he agrees with the statement by the Director of Public Prosecutions that a constitutional referendum should be held to reinstate the offence of statutory rape, which statement was originally made by him to the Joint Committee on Child Protection in 2006 and repeated by him on 27 June 2008 in a speech at UCC; and if the Government is committed to the holding of such a referendum.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[27535/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the views of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There is little point in going back over old ground on the reasons for the 2006 Act but, in light of the decision of the Supreme Court in the CC case, the Government had a choice of either introducing emergency legislation that fully complied with that decision or doing nothing in the short term, which would have meant no offence of carnal knowledge of girls under 15 years of age.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children is examining the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, published in February 2007 by the Minister for Health and Children.  It provided wording for inclusion in the Constitution on the rights of children which could be put to the people in a referendum.  The wording included a provision that would allow the Oireachtas to pass laws providing for offences of absolute or strict liability committed against or in connection with children under 18 years of age.  The committee is due to report to the Oireachtas by the end of November 2008.  The Government will await the report of the joint committee.  If one thing is clear from events of the past few years, this is not the type of decision that should be rushed.  We do not intend to usurp the work of the committee nor to anticipate its report.  However, we are in contact with the Attorney General on the options for legislation that might be available.</P>
        <P>A referendum has by no means been ruled out.  It is still a live option, but any decision to hold a referendum on the reintroduction of absolute liability would only be the beginning of a process.  In a referendum, we would have to place before the people the general scheme of a Bill to give effect to what they would be asked to vote on.  For example, the age below which absolute protection would apply, the age of consent, the question of sex amongst children of approximately the same age and the liability of persons in a position of authority or trust over the child would be among the issues that would have to be addressed in a general scheme.  The people would have to know exactly what they were being asked to vote on.  In addition, before asking the people to vote, the Government would like a broad level of agreement among the political parties on the wording of a constitutional amendment and the legislation following a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P><Col N="20"/>
        <P>I am intent on fulfilling my duty to safeguard and increase the legal safeguards of all our citizens.  Only yesterday, I met my colleagues in the European Union and we acknowledged that the protection of the rights and freedoms of our citizens is the first of the common values held by us as guardians within the Council.  We agreed to make protecting children against crime, in particular crime of a sexual nature, an important objective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister confirm he is a member of the committee to which he referred?  Does he agree a statutory rape law fulfils a vital role in the scheme of criminal law relating to sexual offences against children, as stated by the DPP?  Does he acknowledge that the task of prosecuting in such cases in the absence of a statutory rape law is immensely more difficult?  Will the Minister confirm that a referendum remains not an option to reintroduce absolute liability to protect children but Government policy that such a referendum will be held?</P>
        <P>Will he acknowledge that the committee to which he referred can make absolutely no progress until all parties to it, including those in government, bring their suggestions and proposals to it as to the substantive legislation that should accompany any such referendum?  Will he explain why almost two years since publication of the all-party committee report on child protection, which recommended that such legislation be prepared in draft form as a prerequisite to a referendum, the Government has been completely incapable of producing to the committee proposals of a substantive nature to enable it to make progress?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said when I attended a recent committee meeting, the Government&rsquo;s position is as it was prior to the establishment of the committee.  I have attended committee meetings for only a number of weeks and the more I attend, the more I realise how complex are the issues, not only those of absolute and strict liability but also adoption and softer issues that are in the proposal to amend the Constitution.</P>
        <P>With regard to the 2006 Act, the Government had the option of doing nothing and leaving an incredibly difficult situation or introducing a law, which it was always accepted would not be a long-term solution.  That is why the Government moved to establish the most recent committee.  Members on all sides of the House accept this is not an easy issue.  As I stated to the committee, the Government could come in with proposals that would not necessarily be acceptable to Opposition Members.  We want to achieve as much consensus as possible on this issue.  While some people are of the opinion that a referendum is unnecessary, others are of a different opinion.  This situation pertains in a number of parties.  For example, members of the Deputy&rsquo;s party hold different opinions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister confirm whether the Government is racked by confusion and indecision on this issue?  Will he acknowledge that the child protection committee is not making progress because almost two years after the publication of its proposals to hold a referendum and to draft substantive legislation, the Government has not tabled any measure?  Will he also acknowledge that achieving a consensus within a committee is impossible when the only substantive proposals before it have been made by Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in?  Will he explain to the House how the committee can, while waiting to deal with other issues another day, reach conclusions on the issue of providing an absolute zone of protection for children in <Col N="21"/>the absence of the Government engaging in a discussion on the legislative basis and in circumstances in which the Government is apparently shifting its ground and is on the verge of determining not to hold a referendum?</P>

        <QRef>[27171/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>In March 2008, the Government approved the development of new national children detention facilities on the Oberstown campus in Lusk, County Dublin.  The Government decision was informed by the report of the expert group on children detention schools, which is available on the Irish Youth Justice Service, IYJS, website.  The development will increase the accommodation capacity in the detention school system from 77 places to 167 places.  There are already three detention schools on the site.  The effect of the proposed development will involve the demolition of some existing buildings on-site and the retention of others, but will consist mainly of newly constructed facilities.</P>
        <P>The development will be carried out on a phased basis.  The first phase, which is scheduled to be completed in 2012, will provide 80 places to accommodate 16 to 17 year old boys to remove this age group from St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and to facilitate the transfer of boys from the existing Oberstown boys school, which is scheduled for demolition.  The second phase, which is envisaged for completion in 2014, will entail the demolition of the existing Oberstown boys school and the long-term unit of Oberstown girls school, as well as a number of other buildings.  This phase will also involve the construction of facilities for 57 young people.  Some of the existing buildings, such as Trinity House school, will be retained, providing a total of 167 places when both stages of the project are completed.  While it is anticipated that this will supply adequate detention places to meet demands up to 2031, further assessment of the number of places required will be carried out before phase 1 is completed.</P>
        <P>On 12 May, a project manager to oversee the development of the new facility was appointed from within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  On 27 June 2008, a notice inviting tenders from interested parties to provide a full team to design the new facilities was published through the e-Tenders website.  This notice was also placed in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> in line with EU procurement rules.  The closing date for receipt of tenders is Friday, 8 August 2008.  It is anticipated, subject to thorough evaluation of the tenders received and the identification of a suitable company, to award the contract in the latter part of this year with a view to having the design process completed in the early part of 2009.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">The design team will be required to advise on architectural, construction and engineering matters, to deliver high quality designs and to manage the construction of modern, state-of-the-art facilities.  The design team will include, but is not limited to, expertise in architecture, construction project management, planning, health and safety, fire safety, cost estimation and control, engineering and building services.</P><Col N="23"/>
        <P>The project will be overseen by the Irish Youth Justice Service, an executive office in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has responsibility for a wide range of youth justice matters, including the children detention schools.  In preparing the request for tenders, the IYJS undertook an extensive consultation exercise with a wide range of key stakeholders.  In particular, the IYJS consulted with the relevant non-governmental organisations and representatives of the staff of the schools.  In addition, opinions were sought from the Department of Education and Science and the local VEC in respect of facilities for education and training.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child also informed the process.  As children will be the primary users of the facilities, children currently detained in the existing detention schools and the 16 to 17 year old boys held in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution were also asked for their opinions.</P>
        <P>Regarding commercial sensitivity issues, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not in a position to indicate the projected indicative cost of the development.  However, he can confirm that the cost involved will be met from national development plan-Exchequer sources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the progress made in respect of juvenile justice in latter years.  The concerns regarding the proposed housing of juveniles in Thornton Hall are well founded.  As a minimum, the proposed facilities should be delivered ahead of the Thornton Hall development.  Given that the land is owned by the State and given its history, there should be no problem with planning permission.</P>
        <P>That the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention is to have juveniles housed in Thornton Hall is deeply concerning to children&rsquo;s rights groups and others.  In light of the economic climate, will he give a commitment to the effect that the holding of juveniles in Thornton Hall will not become a permanent fixture?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The facility in Thornton Hall is intended to be a temporary one.  The Deputy&rsquo;s concerns are not misplaced and we do not want the provision to be permanent.  I assure him that during detention in such temporary accommodation, children&rsquo;s basic rights will be maintained, they will be provided with first class education facilities via the local VEC and they will be separated from all adult prisoners.  The basic rights of anyone being held in custody will be guaranteed.  It is the Department&rsquo;s strong intention that the measure will be temporary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Recently, Ms Emily Logan, the Ombudsman for Children, announced that she was against the proposed transfer of the Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre to the facility in question.  Children&rsquo;s rights groups are also opposed to it.  I lend my voice to their concerns, as the facility should be kept in Finglas.  It is the only facility that provides psychological assessments to children referred by the courts.  What are the Minister of State&rsquo;s opinions in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The facility in Finglas is the assessment centre for young people.  Bringing all the services to one site will achieve a degree of efficiency.  While the Finglas centre will continue in the meantime, the Deputy is correct in that we are considering its long-term future and whether bringing it to the Oberstown campus would be more efficient.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister of State will acknowledge that the problems of juvenile crime and vandalism are worsening, particularly in some communities.  When the Children Act 2001 was enacted, it was welcomed as ground-breaking in that it contained specific provisions to make parents responsible and to prevent abdication of their responsibilities in <Col N="24"/>respect of their children in certain circumstances.  Why, seven years after the law&rsquo;s enactment, has the provision in question not been used?</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The administration of justice is exclusively the duty of the courts and it would be inappropriate for any Minister to advise the courts on how to carry out sentencing in individual cases.  The specific provision to which the Deputy referred, which places obligations on parents in regard to offences committed by their children, was not commenced until July 2007.  Certain changes had to be made to District Court rules subsequent to that.  These measures were not put into law for no reason and it is clearly our intention that they be implemented.  However, we also must acknowledge that the majority of children who come before the Children&rsquo;s Court do so against a background of chaotic family life.  In such cases, the District Court judge is informed by Garda liaison officers and probation officers as to the most appropriate way of dealing with them.  Attempting to place attachment orders on the parents may not be the most appropriate solution.  However, I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point that these measures should be implemented.  They were included for a reason.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not inviting the Minister of State to comment on sentencing policy, but parts of the Children Act have been incrementally invoked since 2001.  These provisions are a matter of public policy and were bruited in this House as part of the response to juvenile vandalism, anti-social behaviour and general miscreancy.  Why, seven year later, have they not been invoked?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree it is unacceptable that legislation which was passed in 2001 should take six or seven years to be commenced by ministerial order?  Does he accept that this makes a mockery of the rules of this House?</P>
        <P>Will the new campus at Oberstown be largely modelled on the Woodlands juvenile justice centre in Bangor, County Down?  What types of facilities will be provided there?  Can the Minister of State provide a projected opening date and will he indicate whether this proposal is immune from the budgetary cuts expected to be announced today?</P>
        <P>Following from the point made by Deputy Joe Carey, is the Minister aware that the placing of 16 and 17 year olds in Thornton Hall, should that occur after its construction, could result in the State being in violation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child?  Children must not be placed in what is designed as an adult facility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first matter, the provisions of the Children Act ascribing responsibility to parents for crimes committed by their children arise out of the District Court finding regarding wilful neglect on the part of parents.  I am sure no Member is a cheerleader for putting parents in that position.  State services generally try to avoid a scenario in accordance with the District Court conclusion in this regard.  It is something that will be rarely done.  As I said to Deputy Rabbitte, that measure was not commenced until July 2007.  I do not agree this makes a mockery of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It makes a mockery of the Government&rsquo;s public relations exercise in 2001.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Children Act is a superb legislative measure which has served us well in the short time it has been in force.</P>
        <P>The anticipated opening date of the first phase of the Oberstown facility is 2012, at which time it is hoped the transfer of inmates from St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution will take place.  I cannot <Col N="25"/>comment on any possible impact on this project as a result of potential budgetary changes.  However, the opening of the Oberstown facility is a high priority for my Department.  I am assured that if accommodation is to be provided in Thornton Hall as a temporary measure, it will be entirely separate.  I have absolutely no doubt that such a separated facility will meet our obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 121 together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 53, given earlier today.  As I indicated, progress in this area can best be achieved through cross-party consensus.  I acknowledged that there are widely diverging views on the subject, not only between different parties but within the parties.  My aim is to ensure that gaming activities are carried out within a responsible framework which recognises the reality of these activities and the changed environment in which they now take place, including on the Internet, and which also ensures they are properly and responsibly managed, particularly in respect of those who may experience problems as a result of their participation in gaming activities.</P>
        <P>My proposal was to proceed on the basis of agreement to establish a cross-party committee and to publish the report of the casino committee, Regulating Gaming in Ireland, within the framework of that committee.  However, due to the delay in establishing the cross-party committee, I have decided to go ahead with the publication of the casino regulation committee report imminently in advance of the establishment of the informal cross-party committee.  I will welcome all observations on the report.</P>
        <P>As it is still my intention to proceed with the establishment of the committee, the invitation to the Labour Party for a representative to participate in the committee remains open.  This approach presents an opportunity to Oireachtas Members to contribute, at the important policy formulation stage, to the future architecture of gaming in Ireland.  I remain of the view that it is the best way forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister offers the view that this is such a complex issue that it requires an all-party committee.  He put forward the same view in regard to statutory rape.  I do not know whether he regards these two issues as more complex than the economy or whether he also intends to involve the Opposition in the financial management of the State.</P>
        <P>Other than the casino sector, which is currently unregulated, what are the Minister&rsquo;s priorities in terms of regulation?  When does he intend to put in place the proposed informal committee of the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I intend to publish the casino regulation committee&rsquo;s report in the coming days.  The committee considered a broad range of issues other than simply casinos.  It strongly recommends that gaming and betting should be treated as two completely separate <Col N="26"/>types of gambling activities &mdash; for example, it makes recommendations in regard to where each can take place.</P>
        <P>These are complex issues.  This excellent report deserves further analysis not only by the Government but also by the Oireachtas.  It points to the need for a regulatory authority, based in the Department, to oversee gaming and casinos.  It also refers to the incredibly addictive nature of fixed odds betting terminals, which have become a prominent feature in the United Kingdom.  The report also refers to the issue of Internet gambling but it comes to no conclusions.  These issues can only be dealt with through a comprehensive examination which includes a mechanism whereby the public can make its views known, whether in support of or in opposition to the proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister acknowledges that the international literature indicates that fixed odds betting terminals are woefully addictive, especially in the case of young working class youths.  In light of this and having regard to the difficulties we experienced 20 years ago, which resulted in local authorities exercising their power to exclude slot machines, is the Minister agreeable to publishing the casino regulation committee&rsquo;s report with a commitment that the all-party committee will not have to consider the question of allowing for the introduction of fixed odds betting terminals in the State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given my views on this issue.  The casino regulation committee has recommended that it be examined.  The report was reasonably restricted in terms of the type of consultation that took place.  It looked at international practice as well as some of the research that was done previously in the State.  We now have an opportunity to allow people to give their views.  From what I have read concerning these terminals, I would be hesitant about allowing them to be available anywhere in the country because they are the modern, sophisticated equivalent of one-armed bandits.  The report refers to the issue of Internet betting, which is far more complex.  This report draws on a range of issues, including where betting is taking place.  That raises issues about taking legal action concerning how the Internet is operated.  Internet betting is targeted in this report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of this urgent problem, which requires public discussion and consideration by Members of the Oireachtas, can the Minister explain why this report has been suppressed by the Government for a year?  Can he explain why it was not published a long time ago?  Would the Minister agree that gambling, and particularly Internet betting, is ravaging the lives of many young people in their teens and 20s?  Has the Government given any consideration as to what policy, if any, it might put in place to tackle that issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>When this report became available, it was the Government&rsquo;s view that a cross-party committee should be established.  The Deputy&rsquo;s party was asked for its views and, in fact, it was suggested that a Fine Gael Member should be the committee chairman.  The reason for the delay was that we could not get all party agreement. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I am missing something here.  We are dealing with an issue which the Minister states is of some importance.  He quotes from a report in his possession that no Members of this House or any members of the public have seen, yet he expects people to engage, at his invitation, in some informal group to discuss the matter.  It is at least a discourtesy to Members of the House to selectively quote extracts from a report that nobody else has seen.  The only reason we cannot see it is because he will not let us do so.  I ask the Minister to publish the document tomorrow.  He should provide each Member of the House with a copy of the document before matters are progressed any further.  If the Minister accedes to my request, which is eminently reasonable, he might explain what he means by an informal committee.  What terms of reference does he have in mind?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, I will be publishing the report within the next few days.  I can publish it tomorrow.  I do not see any problem in that respect.  As regards the informal committee, it is a cross-party committee.  The discussions about it predated me becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I understand that my predecessor had discussions with Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett and other Members on the formulation of such a committee.  My predecessor believed it would be the right way to proceed on important policy formulation, thus giving the Opposition an opportunity to participate.  The Government side of the House is not saying it has all the knowledge on it.  The last time a piece of major legislation was brought forward in this area was in 1956.   </P>

	<P>I wish to register a protest.  There was an opportunity for the Government to have made these announcements in the House, but we did not receive the statement until well after 3.30 p.m. despite the commitments given by the Taoiseach.  A number of the measures announced by the Government today have been promoted by the Fine Gael Party for quite some time.  I support the measures that have been mentioned, in particular, in respect of the huge expenditure on public relations and consultants within Departments, the element of ministerial and higher civil servants&rsquo; pay, and the attempt to halt the shambles that has become evident in respect of the decentralisation programme.  These matters have been referred to by Fine Gael for a number of years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This three and a half page document appears to have been cobbled together in an ill thought out fashion since the half-yearly figures were produced by the Department of Finance last week.  This is not about a fiscal crisis for the country; it is the consequence of economic mismanagement by a Government which has proven itself to be probably the worst Administration of the past 50 years.  This document contains no vision, economic stimulation or anti-inflationary measures.  It seems to me that the document is ill-thought out and has been cobbled together haphazardly.</P>
        <P>Can the Taoiseach provide a breakdown of how the &euro;440 million in savings will be apportioned between the broad categories referred to?  As regards all Departments, State agencies and local authorities where a 3% payroll cut is to become effective by the end of next year, can the Taoiseach give a guarantee that no front line services will be affected outside the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science?  Many of those Departments and local authorities provide front line services such as social welfare benefits, waste collection and waste management.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for indicating some measure of support for some of the initiatives the Government is taking in light of the changed economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  The Government certainly does not have ill-thought out policies.  We are trying to ensure that we can work together within the social partnership <Col N="29"/>process to meet the challenge we face.  The Minister for Finance has outlined in broad terms the areas where his Department is satisfied that savings of up to &euro;440 million can be achieved in the context of trying to work within agreed spending limits for 2008, with longer-term effects in 2009 of over &euro;1 billion.  This is the initial response by the Government to the Exchequer mid-year returns, which were published last week.  I said in the House then that the appropriate way to proceed was for the Government to take decisions at Cabinet this morning on foot of what emerged and to have a full debate this week in the House on all the economic issues.  Ministers will come into the House and deal with the matters as they affect their own particular Departments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has not given me a broad breakdown of the &euro;440 million.  Is he taking personal responsibility for this?  Who will be responsible for a failure to meet the 3% reduction in the public payroll that he mentioned?  The second page of the document states that the parameters of the exception for the health and education sector are to be agreed by the Departments concerned with the Department of Finance.  We were told in March this year that every Department had carried out a detailed report on its fiscal position.  Why is this document full of vague generalities?  The statement on the second page means that there is no agreement between the Departments and that the Taoiseach has been unable to get one.</P>
        <P>Of the &euro;19 billion spent on the public payroll, &euro;14 billion refers to health and education.  That means that the Government will get &euro;150 million from the 3% reduction outside health and education.  Where is the remainder to come from?  Is it a fact of life that the Government will not now reach the 0.54% of GNP target for overseas development aid?  Is there not a robbery of the overseas aid development budget in this document?  Can the Taoiseach give a guarantee that the Government will meet the figures set out for overseas development aid in last year&rsquo;s budget?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated that further expenditure on the acquisition of accommodation for decentralisation will await detailed consideration of the reports from the decentralisation implementation group.  Does that mean that this is effectively dead unless a contract has been signed for land acquisition?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the requirement to reduce the payroll bill by 3% by the end of 2009, we are looking at appropriate measures identified by local management in the light of local circumstances across Departments, State agencies and local authorities.  The measures to be taken will include the control of premium pay, the management of vacancies, the organisation of work processes and the levels at which work is carried out, as well as the control of numbers through recruitment and other measures.</P>
        <P>The contribution from the health and education sectors should be an agreed process with the Department of Finance, being mindful of the need to protect front line staff to the greatest possible extent, including teachers, special needs assistants, nurses and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>So it is not guaranteed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The 3% in respect of all other Departments, State agencies and local authorities should yield &euro;250 million by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>We made a commitment of 0.54% of GNP for 2008 and we intend to honour that.  Reports are due from the decentralisation implementation group and no further decisions to acquire property should take place until this report is properly considered by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a U-turn.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="30"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I watched the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance deliver their press conference on the Internet.  I saw them answer the questions posed by journalists and I looked through their statement.  Whatever this is, it is not a plan for the economy.  It is a back of the envelope book-keeping exercise.  It contains a few prudent measures, some of which had been sought for some time from this side of the House.  Examples include dropping the ministerial pay increase and measures relating to decentralisation, something about which I questioned the Taoiseach only a couple of weeks ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most of the statement appears to be full of headline grabbers that appear to be designed more to restore political confidence in the Government than to restore confidence in the economy.  The astonishing thing about it is that it says little or nothing to the 54,000 people who have lost their jobs over the past year.  We are talking about an additional 2,668 people in Waterford, 3,389 in Cork and 1,250 in Blanchardstown.  Forty three of the labour exchanges in this country have seen an increase in unemployment of more than 50% in the past 12 months.  Most of that increase comes from job losses in the private sector, while there are hundreds of thousands of people who are worried about their jobs this evening.  There is nothing in this plan that puts those people back to work or makes them secure in their employment.  In fact, the only thing the Government provides is a plan to continue paying them the dole, rather than a plan to get them back to work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the Government&rsquo;s plan to restore confidence in the economy and to get the private sector growing again?  There is a proposal to reduce the payroll bill by 3% across every Department, State agency and local authority, with the exception of health and education.  How much of the &euro;1 billion the Government plans to save next year will be achieved by that 3% cut?  How much of that 3% cut will be achieved by a reduction in the number of public servants who are working in those Departments?  What assessment was done by the Government of the impact of such cuts on the public services for which those Departments are responsible?</P>
        <P>Can we take it that today&rsquo;s announcement is the totality of the measures that will be announced by individual Departments, State agencies and local authorities?  For example, will the 3% pay cut in the payroll in local authorities be made up by those authorities introducing additional charges or increasing existing charges?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The exercise in which we are engaged today was not about providing an economic plan for the country.  We are trying to ensure today that we react responsibly and sensibly to the changed situation that arose as a result of the Exchequer returns last week.  Based on the most up to date information available to the Department of Finance, it is clear that tax revenues will be down &euro;3 billion.  That being the case, we must make sure that we do whatever we can to ensure that we work within the spending limits we set ourselves.  We must use this as the first phase in an exercise in devising a budgetary strategy for 2009 and beyond.  I believe it is timely and appropriate to come forward with this set of measures within a week of the publication of the Exchequer returns.  On the question of this not being directed to people at work, quite the contrary is true.  The most important way for us to maintain levels of employment and return to potential growth rates in the economy as soon as possible is to have a sustainable public finance position.  The public finance position has deteriorated this year.  We are not alone in respect of that public finance deterioration.  Deputies can look at any other country they wish where similar issues arise.  It is precisely because we have in mind those who have lost their jobs or those who are at risk of losing their jobs that we are taking the corrective action as quickly as was possible.  This is our assessment based on the information available at the moment.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore asked about the rest of the year beyond what we have done here.  This is what we believe is the minimum required.  The Government has also undertaken to continue <Col N="31"/>to monitor on a monthly basis the ability of Departments to provide the savings that have been agreed this morning.  He asked about what a 3% pay bill reduction by 2009 would provide.  I would estimate from memory that it would be approximately &euro;250 million.  That is not important.  What we are doing there is not applying a blunt uniform inflexible embargo instrument, but are providing the necessary manoeuvrability at local level for local management in the light of local circumstances to identify appropriate measures, which would include in some cases non-recruitment of non-frontline staff or non-essential staff, based on the present situation, or considering the question of premium pay, management of vacancies, the organisation of work processes etc.</P>
        <P>We are seeking to ensure we devise a framework which is clear about the outcome we need to obtain, but is prepared to work with those with this difficult task ahead of them in a way that gives them the best possible means of achieving it according as they would determine given their knowledge of the local circumstances and for the purposes of avoiding a greater disruption of services than would otherwise be the case had the more blunt mechanism been utilised.  That is the thinking behind what we have proposed today.  It is not regarded as a panacea or the ultimate answer to all the challenges that face us.  As I have said to colleagues &mdash; and they have agreed &mdash; we have further challenges in the context of the Estimates campaign in preparation for 2009.  We need to be as imaginative and as determined regarding that wider exercise as, I am glad to say, the Government has proven itself to be this morning regarding this particular exercise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am somewhat surprised at the figure the Taoiseach has just given us for his estimate of the amount that would be saved by a 3% payroll reduction across Departments, State agencies and local authorities.  The Taoiseach has advised that would come to &euro;250 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what it would be between now and the end of 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>For a year and a half that is crazy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach referring to the period between now and the end of 2009?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are starting the process now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>These figures do not add up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They do add up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has told us the Government would save &euro;1 billion in 2009.  If the 3% payroll reduction only comes to &euro;250 million between now and the end of 2009, where on earth is the &euro;750 million for the remainder of 2009 and the remainder of the &euro;190 million for 2008 to come from?  That does not stack up.  Even at the rate the Government is placing advertisements with television stations, newspapers etc., cutting advertisements and consultants and all the other headline grabbers in all these measures will not add up to &euro;750 million in 2009 plus an extra &euro;190 million in 2008.  That does not stack up.  If a 3% cut in payroll comes to &euro;250 million, the rest of his figures are a fairytale.</P>
        <P>I again ask the Taoiseach to tell us how much of the &euro;1 billion in 2009 will be made up by the 3% cut in payroll so that we can have some assessment?  Clearly the information will come out in dribs and drabs as individual Ministers make individual announcements and individual decisions are made in individual local authorities etc.  In order to get a general assessment as to the impact on the overall public service of the 3% cut in payroll, I again ask the Taoiseach <Col N="32"/>to give us the total figure for that in 2009 as compared with the &euro;1 billion the Government plans to save in 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to official documentation.  Again I can confirm that the figure is &euro;250 if my memory recall is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>From where will the other &euro;750 million come?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Finance knows the figures in this regard and the impact of the savings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach know?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure I gave the House is the correct figure.  The &euro;440 million savings we are seeking to provide for the remainder of this year have a full year effect in 2009.  The present effect will last for six months during the remaining half of this year and will continue into 2009.  I am being very clear with the House.  It is not a question of dribs and drabs.  I made it clear that on receiving the mid-year returns the Government would make decisions to seek to ensure we work within the expenditure limits we had set ourselves.  We agreed to have a nine hour debate in the House, which is the right place for the debate.  Rather than having it come out in dribs and drabs, the Ministers will come to the House tomorrow to outline what contribution can be made by individual Departments in respect of the efficiency savings that have been mentioned totalling approximately &euro;240 million, the 3% payroll bill reduction we are seeking by 2009, and the various administrative and other savings that are being contemplated and upon which agreement and decisions have been made.  It is a very clear position by Government.</P>
        <P>This is just a phase in a process&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There is more to come.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of engagement by Government across all Departments for the purpose of having a sustainable budgetary strategy going into 2009 that will address the issues we need to address.  Apart from this contention that there was some effort to fritter away resources, let us remind ourselves that we have been paying to invest in a capital budget out of current budget surpluses year on year under this Administration and previous Administrations, which confirms there was not a frittering away of money.  Money was being used from current budget surpluses for productive purposes to build up the capacity of the economy.  The proof of that is that despite not having growth in the economy in 2008, the economy is 30% bigger than it was in 2002 precisely because during the years from 2003 to 2007 we used the current budget surpluses for the purposes, in the main, of providing a capital programme which is greatly enhanced.</P>

	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 16, Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008, Committee and Remaining Stages, agreed to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not agreed.  Some 52 amendments are tabled to the Bill, one of which deals with sequential or tiered opening hours, which is a cause of great concern to people.  Every Deputy from all sides of the House and none has a view on this.  The use and abuse of alcohol and the difficulties it causes socially and for families and the persons themselves is of great importance to everybody.  It is not right that the debate on this Bill should be guillotined in this fashion.  Some 52 amendments have been tabled to it and I object to the proposal by the Government to guillotine the debate on the Bill in this way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a similar view.  Some 32 of the amendments to which Deputy Kenny referred have been tabled by the Minister, highlighting the fact the Bill has been filleted beyond recognition by the Minister, and rightly so, because it was originally misconceived as a PR stunt to be enacted before the summer recess.</P><Col N="37"/>
        <P>The Bill has 52 amendments tabled to it, some of which are very important.  Some of them, for example, require patrons of nightclubs to be disgorged on to the streets of Dublin and other cities at the same time, which would put extra pressure on public transport, the emergency services and invite further public disorder.  It is important that we have time to adequately tease out these issues.  As the Government proposes that Committee, Report and Final Stages be taken together, we will not have that opportunity.  We will have reason to rue the day for doing that because there are some hurried ill-considered proposals in the Bill.  I ask the Taoiseach, if it is not too late, to give us adequate time to debate them.</P>

	<P>I regret to advise the Deputies that this is a Bill the Government seeks to have enacted before the summer recess because it contains some important public order provisions, which we believe should be brought forward and enacted.  I am not in a position to accept a deferral of the Bill until next session.</P>

	<P>For the third time I object to the principle of the guillotine here.  The new Chief Whip, Deputy Pat Carey, should know guillotines are not acceptable to the Opposition.  This is an important Bill.  Although there is only a small number of amendments from the Seanad, I again register my opposition to the Government&rsquo;s guillotining of Bills in this way.</P>

	<P>The D&aacute;il is here to keep the Executive to account.  If the Bills are guillotined by a majority of Government supporters, we cannot hold the Government to account effectively.  That is why the Opposition objects to guillotines.  We do it in the name and the interests of democracy.  That is why we are sent here.  While the Seanad amendments to this Bill are not earth shattering, although it is a nuclear Bill, the principle is the same.  We object to the Government&rsquo;s guillotining this Bill.</P>

By the time we return in the autumn, three quarters of the year will be gone and people with relatives in nursing homes will still be struggling to pay for their keep.  May I, again, ask the Taoiseach about the &euro;110 million that was allocated this year for the fair deal and whether there has been a decision?  The Minister for Health and Children indicated she was considering ensuring some of that money was released to assist families.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask about the legislation on the same issue.  At the end of last week&rsquo;s meeting of the health committee, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Chairman informed the committee that the legislation would be published this week.  I had left the meeting but I have the transcript.  However, when I asked the Taoiseach last week he told me it would not be published this session.  Both Age Action Ireland and Nursing Homes Ireland were at that meeting and went away with one view, while the Taoiseach has given us another view.  I would like a bit of clarity, if possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly can take it that the person with the most authoritative and up-to-date information is probably the Taoiseach rather than a committee Chairman, who, I am sure, was acting in good faith in indicating when he thought it might be published.  Some time ago I indicated in this House to the Leader of the Opposition that I did not expect this legislation to be published before the end of this session.  I made that point as soon as it became clear to me that it would be the case.  Publication will hopefully happen some time during the recess.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer is not that satisfactory.  At least he has clarified it.  He spoke here last week and his committee Chairman spoke after that.  It is not unreasonable to accept the last word spoken on behalf of the Government.  While the Taoiseach may have clarified the matter, he could have done so with a little more generosity of spirit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Taoiseach tell me precisely when we can expect the national monuments Bill, or will it remain a monument to the Government&rsquo;s inefficiency?

	<P>We were discussing amendments Nos. 7, 8, and 67.  Is that correct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, those amendments are being discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>During the debate last week I outlined the reasons I felt that paragraphs (<i>g</i>) and (<i>h</i>) of amendment No. 8 should be placed on page 14 in the objectives of the new Dublin transport authority.  </P>
        <P>Amendment No. 67 also refers to the rights of workers.  In particular, it seeks to ensure that the transfer of undertakings rights would apply to transport workers in relation to the operation of the new agency and the possible transfer of officials and salaried workers between different agencies.</P>
        <P>With regard to the public service contract I seek, on page 41 of the Bill, between lines nine and ten, to include the following: &ldquo;the obligation on the public transport operator to comply with all employment legislation is specified in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Employment Law Compliance Act 2008 and any instruments specified in Part II of Schedule 1 of the said Act, and employment regulation Orders and registered employment agreements within the meaning of the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 2004&rdquo;.  I attended a large meeting of transport workers last night organised by the Transport Salaried Staffs&rsquo; Association, TSSA.  Grave concern was expressed about measures in the employment law consolidation Bill and about the possibility that the transfer of undertakings which is specified in the EU Transfer of Undertakings ( Protection of Employees) Regulations 2003, under SI 131/2003, would not apply to transfers between the existing transport agencies and the new DTA.  The directive sets out the rights of employees very clearly.  There is a fear among public transport workers that their rights and conditions of employment will be sacrificed if the DTA is set up without a provision such as the one outlined in amendment No. 67.</P>
        <P>The amendment also seeks to add to the public transport service contract a further requirement that &ldquo;the public transport operator shall be required to grant work staff previously taken on to provide services, the rights to which they would have been entitled if there had been a transfer within the meaning of Directive 2001/23/EC together with all pension rights and entitle<Col N="43"/>ments of the said staff with the previous public transport operator.&rdquo;.  This paragraph seeks to further amplify the necessity to ensure that workers in existing agencies in the public transport area are protected when the new DTA comes into operation.  It is quite clear from the many meetings I have attended on behalf of the Labour Party with stakeholders, including commuters, cyclists, pedestrians, public and private transport operators, chambers of commerce and so forth, that people are concerned that as the DTA evolves, it will become a very powerful body.  It represents a major break with the past in terms of administration in Ireland, given that it will be a regional structure.  The DTA will function almost as a regional government structure.  That is why the amendments concerning accountability to which I referred on the Order of Business are so important.</P>
        <P>It is also critical that the rights of workers are protected and clearly laid down.  That is important, not just in the public sector but also in the private sector, given the concern that some private operators might cut corners and that it is harder to invigilate the protection of private sector workers, particularly those who do not belong to a trade union.  We must try to lay down some basic ground rules for their protection and I have sought to do so in the aforementioned amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to amendment No. 7, the objectives of the DTA include the provision of a safe public transport system.  It is a normal duty imposed on any provider of transport that the service should be provided in a safe manner.  However, that is not the same as providing the DTA with a regulatory role with regard to safety, which would be the effect of amendment No. 7.  I do not intend that the DTA should be granted a safety monitoring role in this Bill.  It would not be a good idea to do so.  That role should remain with the existing bodies, including the Road Safety Authority, the Railway Safety Commission, the Health and Safety Authority and so forth.  All these bodies have a specific safety remit which extends to  transport, in some circumstances.  Giving the DTA, as well as those other agencies, a role in safety could have the opposite effect to that intended by the Deputy.  It could cause confusion as to who is responsible for what in an emergency.  I do not think a safety monitoring role is a good idea in that regard.  </P>
        <P>I know the motivation behind the amendment is a concern to ensure that safety is a priority and I assure the Deputy that I share that concern with him.  The DTA will be obliged under the existing road and rail safety framework, including the various Road Traffic Acts, the Railway Safety Act, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act and so forth, to meet obligations for the safety of workers and the public.  That covers the issue more than adequately and, on that basis, I ask Deputy Broughan to withdraw amendment No. 7.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 67 propose to add to the Bill a very specific framework around the terms and conditions of employment.  We had a very good debate on this issue on Committee Stage, discussing the pros and cons of it.  During that debate, I explained to the committee that, arising from Towards 2016, the ten-year framework social partnership agreement, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is preparing legislation to give effect to a range of measures to enhance employment rights and compliance issues.  These include the introduction of the employment law compliance Bill 2008, which will overhaul the State&rsquo;s employment rights framework and a proposed employment law consolidation Bill to simplify and codify employment law spanning more than 60 years.  I also referred to discussions taking place in the partnership talks on the implementation of part two of Towards 2016 in respect of pay, the workplace, employment rights and compliance.  In the context of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007 to which the Deputy referred, I have pointed to the fact that Article 4 of the new regulation provides for mandatory content in public service contracts.  While Article 5 recognises that collective agreements between social partners may be in place in individual member states, it also provides for the protection of the rights of workers through the inclusion of the appropriate provisions in the tender documents and the public service <Col N="44"/>contracts.  Article 6 also provides for the inclusion of national quality standards in tender documents and public service contracts.</P>
        <P>The concerns of the Deputy are met in large part by what we already have in the Bill.  In an effort to address the concerns that inform those amendments, I introduced an amendment to section 48 on Committee Stage to require that the public transport service contracts contain requirements relating to applicable law in respect of pay and terms and conditions of employment.  That amendment now forms part of that particular section.</P>
        <P>Arising from concerns relating to the certification of transport operators, a new paragraph (<i>n</i>) introduces the requirement to hold the appropriate national or international road passenger operator&rsquo;s licence, RPTOL, in the case of contracts relating to public bus passenger services.  RPTOLs are granted every five years and the application criteria relate to a range of issues such as professional competence, good repute and sound financial standing.  In circumstances where the spirit, if not the letter, of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment has been met and having amended the legislation in section 48 on Committee Stage, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.</P>

	<P>The Minister will be familiar with the differences that emerge between agencies in respect of transport safety, particularly in respect of the appalling tragedy at Kentstown in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency when it fell to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, to initiate some of the major steps that led eventually to accountability in that instance.  Inserting a section relating to the upholding of the highest safety and professional standards at the very heart of the objectives of the DTA is a reasonable request.     </P>
        <P>There are continuing concerns among transport workers, particularly in respect of Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007.  The aspect of this directive which concentrates on competition and perhaps privatised competition within the transport sectors of the economy seems to be the hallmark of the framing of a large part of this legislation.  If one looks at the directive, one can see that there are many elements in the preamble, particularly citation 17, which make it clear that the protection of standards and conditions among transport workers is also important given that they are among the most safety-critical workers in the economy.  As I said before, at this very minute, the lives of possibly tens of thousands of our constituents are in the hands of skilful drivers and other staff.  We should transpose citation 17 directly into the Bill.</P>
        <P>Likewise, I make a final appeal to the Minister.  I tried to set out in a new subsection (<i>h</i>) a provision whereby the Labour Court within two years of the establishment of the DTA would have a role in examining standards and conditions of workers across the sector given that we have set out a number of important requirements in respect of the strategic plan, implementation, the laying of plans here and so on.  It seems reasonable that the industrial relations structure would also have a role within a specified time, for example, two years, if the organisation is up and running to see how it has carried out its remit in respect of the invigilation of transport operators.</P>
        <P>Will the Employment Law Compliance Act, with which the Leas-Cathaoirleach is familiar, include transfers of staff from existing public service operators like CIE and Dublin Bus?  Will the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) directive apply to staff and the protection of their pension rights and superannuation in this Bill as it exists?  Otherwise, we need something like section 67.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I know I am confined to two minutes so I will be brief.  In respect of the Kentstown bus accident, the garda&iacute; on the scene made it clear that they were going to prosecute that case.  The HSA came in more on the roadworks element of it.  Incidents like that can be dealt with either by the garda&iacute;, the HSA or, in the case of railway safety, the Railway Safety Commission.</P><Col N="45"/>
        <P>The spirit of this Bill incorporates Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007.  The directive will come into force on 1 September 2009 and we will be subject to that through regulations so the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns in respect of preambles or anything else relating to railway or bus workers are being and will be fully met.</P>
        <P>The other matters are really matters of national import.  They are being dealt with at national level by my colleagues in Government and the social partners, and this is the best approach.  As I stated on Committee Stage, in keeping with the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, if agreements are made that affect anything in this Bill in respect of terms and conditions of employment or anything else, they will be suitably transposed into a new piece of legislation.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 14, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>g</i>) establish social and qualitative criteria to maintain and raise quality standards for public service obligations with regard to minimal working conditions, passenger rights, the needs of persons with reduced mobility, environmental protection, the security of passengers and employees as well as collective agreement obligations, and other rules and agreements concerning workplaces and social protection at the place where service is provided; In order to ensure transparent and comparable terms of competition between operators and to avert the risk of social dumping, the DTA should be free to impose specific social and service quality standards with due regard to recital 17 of Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007 of 23 October 2007,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>h</i>) maintain the highest standard of working conditions including fair and reasonable salaries for all transport workers including those established by collective agreement obligations. The Minister shall request every two years that the Labour Court undertakes a review of conditions of employment in the public transport sector and sets out its recommendations for the appropriate minimum conditions of employment for the sector which will be accepted by the Minister and laid as an order before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Following 21 days this order will take affect and the DTA will make arrangements to adjust the terms of their contracts with public transport operators to give effect to the order.&rsquo;&rsquo;.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, line 33, after &ldquo;fares&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;within the framework of Ministerial Directives under <i>section 26</i> below&rdquo;.</P><Col N="47"/>
        <P FLI="0">This is part of a series of amendments to ensure full accountability to this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 11 sets out the principal functions of the DTA, one of which is to regulate fares.  The effect of the amendment is to state the DTA may regulate fares subject to ministerial direction as provided for in section 26, which gives the Minister power to give policy directions to the DTA on the carrying out of any of its functions.  The power is already in the Bill to allow me as Minister to give a direction on fares.  It does not need to be restated.</P>
        <P>One could state this amendment would not make much difference and I know it is not Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s intent but the amendment introduces uncertainty.  One of the principal functions is qualified by this statement about ministerial direction and the other three are not.  In the legislation, I want to make clear that all functions are subject to ministerial direction and this is what Deputy Broughan would also want because it is the tone of a number of his amendments.</P>
        <P>As it is drafted, the language is clear and unambiguous since the powers in section 26 apply fully to all of the functions listed in section 11, including the fare regulation function.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment because if I were to accept it, it would dilute what he is trying to achieve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I had the pleasure of shadowing the Minister in his previous portfolio when we had a situation with the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  The DTA will become the regulator of fares on which the Minister had a direct say last year and his predecessors in every year prior to then.  How do we know we will not have the same situation this autumn because next month, when we are out of session, gas and electricity prices will see a major jump?  Deputy Durkan and I went through this dance of despair every summer when we followed the energy portfolio.  Is the Minister establishing the DTA to be another CER so he will be able to state it was responsible for introducing higher fares and it had nothing to do with him despite what he stated about the reference to himself under section 26?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to CER, I had no say and the Minister has no say.  CER is an independent regulator and the DTA is a different animal.  The Minister with responsibility for energy has no say and cannot interfere in the price mechanism established with regard to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  This Bill gives the Minister the power, if he or she chooses to exercise it, to give policy direction on fares.  The Minister will not set individual fares but he or she can decide that as a sustainable transport or travel policy we should encourage people to leave their cars and use public transport.  To encourage this, a fares policy might be put in place.  It is in this way the Minister can exercise his or her functions.  CER is a horse of a different colour.  No ministerial intervention is allowed and it is statutorily barred.  The Minister will not have the power to intervene.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not how it looks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not how the Deputy presented it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Broughan is correct.  We had occasion in the past to reach the conclusion that certain policy directives were leaked to the regulator in the instance to which the Minister referred and as a result action was taken by the regulator who had no accountability to this House.  We were in no position to question the regulator.</P>
        <P>To come back to this amendment, I support Deputy Broughan on the basis that we had this debate previously.  One of the saddest aspects of the past couple of years was that at every hand&rsquo;s turn a provision was included in every Bill to ensure an autonomous body was created.  I do not know who creates these notions but effectively the most important element in such <Col N="48"/>legislation was that the Minister did not have to account for a body&rsquo;s actions, particularly if they were controversial and provoked a public reaction.</P>
        <P>I know what the Minister stated but I do not accept in its entirety his comparison with CER.  However, we have many amendments to discuss and we must forge ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as I am concerned no leaks occurred.  I made clear very publically on a number of occasions that I did not agree with the policy being pursued by the regulator.  I thank the Deputy for giving me credit for the fact that the regulator saw the wisdom of my approach and reduced prices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>

	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 15, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>f</i>) provide and issue licenses under the Road Transport Act 1932 for public transport operators operating within the GDA.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment was debated on Committee Stage and I ask the Minister for a response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct that this was debated on Committee Stage and we had a good discussion.  This is a matter for reform of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the Transport Act 1958.  It is my intention to include proposals for an entirely new bus licensing regime in a public transport regulation Bill and I hope to bring that to Government and the House quickly.  It is early to be too precise on the detail of the proposal but the new Bill will deal with the replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the Transport Act 1958, which relate to the provision of bus services by the State bus companies with the 1932 Act relating to private transport operators.  The new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, and the powers to grant licences in the GDA will be given to the DTA.  The new Bill will also encompass provisions relating to the subvented bus market outside the GDA and those have to be consistent with the PSO directive mentioned earlier.  Acceptance of the amendment would mean the DTA would be given responsibility for the licensing system under the 1932 Act and, in advance of the pursuit of the replacement provisions I will promote in the proposed legislation, that is not a tenable position.  I assure the Deputy I will move on the reform of the 1932 and 1958 Acts quickly to meet the requirements of the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s reply and his comments on Committee Stage.  I am worried that, while the opportunity presents itself now to address the issue, the Minister might wait to introduce the legislation relating to the other Acts.  However, sudden changes can take place in the GDA and transport requirements pop up almost overnight with new developments and so on.  Recently, in my constituency, the Circle Line Company ceased its services and this caused problems and inconvenience for many commuters.  This happens throughout the GDA.  How soon can we expect the new legislation, given it is almost as difficult to extract legislation from the Government as it is to extract hen&rsquo;s teeth?  More assurance is needed, given that we are into a recessionary period and the economic impact on the transport <Col N="49"/>sector has not been experienced previously because of increased costs, including fuel costs, which may have an impact on the business plans put forward.</P>
        <P>Commuters&rsquo; transport requirements must be met and there is no sense in allowing scenarios to develop such as that which developed in more recent times.  Will the Minister clarify whether he will be enabled to pre-empt issues provided for in this legislation or will they fall to be dealt with in the proposed legislation to which he referred?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It would be good if the Minister clarified the scenario regarding the DTA later this week when his amendments are dealt with by the Seanad and the President signs the Bill in order that what happened to Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s and Deputy Stagg&rsquo;s constituents in Celbridge a few weeks ago will not happen again.  The DTA will be the operator of last resort and will prevent a dedicated and valuable transport service from disappearing.</P>
        <P>The major problem is legislation was passed when most of the population travelled on bicycles and horses and carts in 1932.  Eighty years later, we are trying to deal with a totally different world.  Fianna F&aacute;il Government after Fianna F&aacute;il Government refused to address the key issues, in particular in the past 11 years.  We have waited six or seven years for clarity on bus licensing in the GDA and nationwide.  The Minister and his predecessors, Deputies Brennan and Cullen, have been abject failures in facilitating public transport.  What has happened is totally unacceptable.  In addition to losing private sector services that were up and running, the Government has handicapped the current public service operators.  These companies often came forward with valuable plans.  For example, Dublin Bus came up with a plan for the greater Swords area while Bus &Eacute;ireann drivers suggested that a service between Dublin and Tullow, County Carlow, was feasible, but company management was unable to progress it because officials in the Department of Transport felt they could not make a decision on licensing.</P>
        <P>This has been an incredible failure of Government.  What does the word &ldquo;quickly&rdquo; mean when used by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats?  The Government has introduced only nine Bills this session.  Over the first year of this miserable Government, which is turning into a massive cutback Government, public transport has been the greatest failure.  The existing dedicated operators have been handicapped and other operators have been prevented from entering the market.  It is deplorable and disgraceful.  The way the Minister is going, we will not even see this authority by this time next year, which is appalling.</P>

	<P>The amendment is fundamental to the future success of the DTA and I do not understand why he cannot accept it.  If at a later date he introduces legislation to replace the 1932 Act, all he has to do is amend this Bill to incorporate it in the new legislation.  In the meantime the DTA could get off to a good start and deal with localised transport needs.  The Department must handle the transport needs of the entire State at a time when we are trying to encourage commuters out of cars on to public transport but localised issues need to be addressed.  It is proposed the DTA should deal with a limited area, where the bulk of the problem lies.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be well aware of the massive 260% increase in transport emissions since 1990 and the targets the State must meet.  I refer to linking services.  If one lives between the DART station and the QBC in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, one may wish to use this public transport system, but how does one get to them?  People drive to the DART station and the QBC stops and clog up church car parks and housing estates.  There is a desire to use public transport.  The DTA should introduce an Imp bus service that would connect people to the stations and bus stops.  This is also relevant to the integrated ticketing proposal.  I fail to see why this cannot be <Col N="50"/>provided for in this legislation and it can be amended if new legislation is introduced to repeal the 1932 Act.</P>
        <P>I have been writing to the Minister about the Patton Flyer, an important service that links Dalkey with Dublin Airport.  Letter after letter returns from the Department stating that an operator has already been appointed for the service.  With the greatest respect, whoever is advising the Minister does not know the locality.  For &euro;7, the Patton Flyer leaves Dalkey, goes through Glasthule to D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Monkstown and Blackrock village, continues along Ailesbury Road, turns into Sandymount, crosses the East Link bridge and goes through the tunnel to Dublin Airport in 40 minutes.  Anyone who would drive a car to the airport from the Dalkey area would be a lunatic.</P>
        <P>When I inquired into the identity of the alternative operator, I realised that the Department&rsquo;s letters were referring to Aircoach, which provides a new service from Greystones.  That service takes the N11 through Stillorgan, goes along Mount Merrion Avenue and joins the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Road.  Given that it does not go near Dalkey, Glasthule, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Monkstown or Blackrock village, those areas have no service.  Obviously, the person in question does not know the area, as no one knowledgeable would write a letter to tell someone that an alternative service was available.</P>
        <P>That large commuter area could be saved and Dublin Airport could avoid having so many cars parked at it for a fortnight.  The cars should be taken off the road, particularly along the route in question.  I appeal to the Minister to set an example to show how serious we are about achieving our transport emission targets.  The situation does not make sense.  If the Minister sees fit after the enactment of this legislation, he could amend it via a new Act to remove power from the transport authority.  In the meantime, we should continue providing a public transport service that will encourage people to get out of their cars and into public transport.  Many people would be prepared to provide services were they authorised to do so.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>j</i>) specific measures to ensure direct lines of ministerial and DTA responsibility, a transparent scoping process, a public information campaign and a comprehensive traffic management plan for the major construction works for Metro North, the Dublin Rail Interconnector and the Luas link up in Dublin,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>k</i>) a comprehensive departmental drink and drug testing policy for all safety critical transport workers in public and private transport companies in the GDA,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>l</i>) a comprehensive departmental psychological testing policy for all safety critical transport workers in public and private transport companies in the GDA,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In amendment No. 10, I sought to extend the principal functions of the DTA by inserting a reference to a new subsection (<i>f</i>).  The principal functions run from (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>), but I wanted to extend them to (<i>f</i>), particularly in respect of an important issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, seems to have been appointed the &ldquo;Minister for Cutbacks&rdquo;.  A Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher kindly showed me the relevant press release.  The Minister of State has a particular role in slashing expenditure right, left and centre.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="52"/>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is welcome that, so far, metro north, the interconnector and other important Transport 21 projects, including the western rail corridor and the Navan railway, have not been cut back.  I hope the Minister will confirm at the earliest opportunity that vital transport infrastructure projects will not be savagely cut back in the bloodletting to be apparently co-ordinated by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.</P>
        <P>The first subsection in my amendment refers to the greatest occurrence in the city since 1916 and 1922, namely, the &ldquo;Big Dig&rdquo;.  Major traffic re-arrangements will need to be made on foot of the construction of metro north and the interconnector.  They are important and will occupy a great deal of media and public debate in the next decade or longer.  I hope the Minister will not back down on these key projects.  He could easily delay them during the preparatory work without mentioning it.  Metro north is at first tender stage, tenders have been received and the Railway Procurement Agency will move to second tender stage next year.  Construction is due to start in approximately 18 months to two years.  I hope that, within the Bill, the Minister will have the confidence to leave the metro north project and other major transport infrastructure works unscathed.  I ask that he accept my new subsection (<i>j</i>).</P>
        <P>The other proposed subsections refer to a comprehensive drink and drug testing policy for all safety-critical workers in public and private transport companies.  Among the Minister&rsquo;s other legislative failures, he has not introduced the promised road safety Bill.  The Minister heard me ask the Taoiseach about this on the Order of Business today.  Seven or eight major road safety issues have not been dealt with in existing legislation.  My amendment proposes that the Dublin transport authority be given a role in regard to the invigilation of alcohol and drug-testing policy for the drivers of our transport fleet, who are safety critical workers.  All the services which originate or end in Dublin would be subject to this invigilation.</P>
        <P>The third part of this amendment, paragraph (<i>l</i>), proposes a &ldquo;comprehensive departmental psychological testing policy for all safety critical transport workers in public and private transport companies in the GDA&rdquo;.  This is an issue constituents and members of the public have raised with me via e-mails and telephone calls in recent months.  I presume psychological testing is a key element in the recruitment of safety critical public transport workers.  However, a shocking case was before the courts in recent days where a public transport driver apparently went berserk, resulting in the tragic loss of life of a female passenger in a car involved in the incident.  My amendment proposes that the Dublin transport authority be given a role in this regard.  This is particularly important in the case of new companies in the private sector which may not have the same long-standing systems, which I assume are in place in CIE, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the Railway Procurement Agency in respect of Veolia and the Luas.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of this Bill is to alleviative traffic congestion and provide alternative means of transport, which is a particularly sensitive issue in commuter areas.  The problems in this regard have been obvious for some time but it took ten years to unravel some of the serious traffic congestion problems on the M50 and other routes.  I hope the Government has learned from that experience.</P>
        <P>The proposals in amendment No. 12 will be of benefit in achieving the objectives of this legislation.  At times of economic flux such as we are currently experiencing, decisions can be made which have the effect of delaying necessary projects not for two or three years but for decades.  Unfortunately, this is what happened on occasion in the past.  The Minister should take the opportunity to examine the proposals before him, review the Bill and ask himself whether now is the opportune time to proceed or whether he can afford to delay and leave unchecked some of the gaps in service and infrastructure which have required action for many years.</P><Col N="53"/>
        <P>The Minister has said that he intends to bring forward further legislation shortly.  As an Opposition Member, I am not convinced by this assurance.  One need only consider the number of Bills that have been on the Order Paper for the past 12 months.  Only four or five of these have moved and nothing has been done in regard to the remainder.  I foresee a situation where three, four or five years might elapse before anything is done.  This is a particularly sensitive issue for people in the commuter belt.  Anything that impacts on that in a positive way, such as this amendment, should be carefully considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s concerns to ensure that in implementing major infrastructural developments, everything should be done to ameliorate any difficulties that may arise.  That is why the Bill sets out an entire series of requirements in terms of who is responsible for what in the context of traffic management planning.  For example, section 64(3) states: &ldquo;A traffic management plan shall in particular identify the actions to be taken to ameliorate the impact on the movement of persons, goods and vehicles arising from construction works and other works in relation to the provision of transport infrastructure and utility works, whether carried out by a road authority or a third party.&rdquo;  Likewise, section 65(3)(<i>a</i>)(ii) provides that the local plan shall specify the &ldquo;measures to be taken to manage utility or other works, whether carried out by the road authority or a third party, on roads in the functional area of the road authority to ameliorate the impact of such works on the movement of persons, goods and vehicles&rdquo;.  In addition, section 65(3)(<i>b</i>)(i) provides that the local traffic plan should identify the actions to be taken to &ldquo;ameliorate the impact on the movement of persons, goods and vehicles arising from construction works and other works in relation to the provision of transport infrastructure&rdquo;.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the intent of the first part of Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s amendment is adequately dealt with in the Bill.</P>
        <P>On safety issues, as I said, road and rail safety are dealt with in other legislation, as are drink and drug-testing and psychological testing of safety critical transport workers.  Appropriate agencies are already in place to deal with such matters under the appropriate legislation.  We have heard a good deal, and will probably hear more in coming weeks and months, about the functions and purpose of various agencies.  There is no point in establishing agencies with specific functions in regard to road or rail safety, for example, only to establish another body with the same functions at a later stage.  This merely gives rise to confusion and turf wars as to which agency is responsible for a particular function.  In some cases, a particular body may claim additional jurisdiction for itself while in other cases, where the task in question is not so pleasant, a particular agency may seek to step back and blame somebody else.</P>
        <P>We must ensure that such a scenario arises in this case.  We already have agencies with responsibility for road and rail safety and adequate legislation is in place on both of these issues.  In addition, we should not forget that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has wide powers in regard to issues affecting the safety of the public.  I am satisfied that the legislation dealing with road and rail safety is the appropriate place to deal with the substantive issues addressed in this amendment.</P>
        <P>Deputy Broughan recently tabled a parliamentary question on the issue of drink and drug-testing of public transport workers.  As I stated in my reply, section 88 of the Railway Safety Act 2005 requires rail companies to draw up a code of conduct for safety critical workers in regard to intoxicants, that is, drugs and alcohols, and the sampling procedures in this regard.  Veolia, as the operator of the Luas, has put forward a code of conduct and the Railway Safety Commission has accepted that as part of the approved safety case for Luas.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is implementing its draft code of conduct pending clarification of some outstanding issues with the Railway Safety Commission.</P><Col N="54"/>
        <P>In regard to bus services, it is illegal to drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of maintaining proper control of the vehicle.  Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 prohibits the driving of a mechanically propelled vehicle by a person while under the influence of an intoxicant.  Enforcement of the law on drink and drug driving is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When a garda suspects a driver of a vehicle is under the influence of an intoxicant, the garda may arrest the suspect under section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.  In addition, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are considering the introduction of drink and drug testing as envisaged in section 13 subsection<i>(1)</i> of the Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  I support and very much encourage that position.  It should be done without further delay.</P>
        <P>The psychological testing of transport workers was discussed on Committee Stage.  That is a matter for the recruitment policies and practices of individual transport companies.  In the railway sector I am informed that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann uses a psychometric testing programme as part of its recruitment and promotion processes.  As part of its recruitment and selection processes, Veolia Transport requires all Luas tram drivers to be assessed fit for driving by the company&rsquo;s independent medical doctor.  In respect of bus passenger services I am informed by Dublin Bus that the company conducts a comprehensive pre-employment medical examination of all employees.  I am also informed that in Bus &Eacute;ireann psychometric testing forms part of the selection process as does a stringent pre-employment medical examination.</P>
        <P>In light of all of those measures that are in place and which are enforceable by various agencies, I ask the Deputy to withdraw those amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the Minister has refused to accept a new amendment in which paragraphs <i>(k)</i> and <i>(l) </i>respectively deal with safety testing for drink and drugs and psychological testing policy.  There is a dearth of modern legislation in this Bill.  It is clear we will not get to my amendments.  In my amendments Nos. 95 and 99, I tried to insert into the Bill some of the missing major points of current safety legislation.  For over a year, the Minister has refused to address the issue as his predecessors did for over a decade.  I commend my Fine Gael colleague and spokesperson on road safety, Deputy Shane McEntee, who has pursued this matter vigorously.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 91 deals with mandatory testing for alcohol after a collision.  The Minister has refused point blank to bring that kind of amendment forward through a road safety Bill.  Members of the civic group campaigning on the issue for the past number of years, Public Against Road Carnage, PARC, were in the Public Gallery last week during the previous discussion.  My intention was to amend the Road Traffic Act 1961 which is almost half a century old in order to make it address critical safety issues.  The Minister has failed absolutely in respect of important safety matters, particularly in this area of public transport.</P>
        <P>With regard to paragraph <i>(f)</i> in the amendment, for the past nine or ten months I have been trying to get the Minister to give us information on the big dig in Dublin.  This will have such a profound impact on the centre of the city that it seems incongruous not to have it in the Bill.  Perhaps it is not there because this Government is not going to go ahead with these projects.  A question mark has been placed over metro north and the interconnector.  Why is the Minister not brave enough to put metro north into legislation so we would know that these related major traffic management matters and infrastructural developments would go ahead?  That would give the capital city a public transport system similar to those in the allegedly poor Eastern European countries that joined us four years ago.  The public transport systems of those countries, even in provincial cities, put us to shame.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to <Col N="55"/>act.  I ask him to be courageous in this regard, to put the provisions into the Bill and hold the Taoiseach and the Government to account.</P>

	<P>The only people who have put a question mark over metro north since I came into this job are in the Labour Party.  Deputy Burton was at it last week and I am sorry if she was disappointed this morning and this afternoon.  Deputy Broughan has constantly raised the question about whether the project was to go ahead.  I respect his interest in the matter.  Along with several people in the media, the Deputies have been the only ones placing question marks.  The RTE website has it that, according to informed sources somewhere, metro north is one of the projects that will definitely be deferred.  I do not know where they have those informed sources.</P>

	<P>The Deputy would be more delighted if he had the opportunity to have a go at me because the project was not to go ahead.  That is one point.  A second is that I am not in charge of traffic management in Dublin city.  Dublin City Council is responsible.  It is bringing all the agencies together and is working towards a traffic management implementation plan with regard to all of these matters.  The Council is holding discussions with the various stakeholders.  I have initiated a series of meetings, the next of which will take place over the coming week or so, to ensure all stakeholders are fully informed.  I am sure Dublin City Council will inform people also.  Work is taking place but it is not my job to come into this House and start dictating what the traffic management plan should be.  It has been carefully worked out by the council.</P>

I told him the relevant legislation will be before this House in the autumn session.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment is designed to give the Joint Committee on Transport the opportunity to engage with the Dublin Transport Authority prior to the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s approving its transport strategy.  Deputies will recall that members of the committee expressed the view on Committee Stage that they should have the opportunity to comment on the draft strategy in advance of it being approved by the Minister for Transport.  This amendment inserts the new subsection<i> </i>(11) into section 12, specifying that when submitting a draft of its transport strategy to the Minister the authority shall also send the draft to the Joint Committee on Transport.  The committee may request an appearance by the chairperson and chief executive of the authority to discuss the draft strategy and shall submit a report to the Minister containing a recommendation on the draft strategy before the Minister decides on the strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment No. 16 puts an onus on the Minister for Transport, before approving the transport strategy, to consider any report received from the regional authorities and any recommendation received from the joint committee concerning the draft transport strategy.  I consider that these amendments, together with the amendments made earlier, will ensure that there is <Col N="57"/>a full and appropriate consultation on the draft DTA transport strategy that will be provided for the Oireachtas, the planning authorities and the various institutions involved.  On that basis, I ask that the other amendment be withdrawn.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Amendment No. 15, in the name of Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, would give the final power to approve the transport strategy, after the Minister has approved it, to the joint Oireachtas committee.  To hand over such an Executive responsibility to the Oireachtas would usurp the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to govern and would totally undermine the ministerial accountability the Deputy has consistently demanded throughout the debate on this legislation.  We had a good and constructive discussion on Committee Stage.  I have tried to widen the process of consultation as much as possible at all times, without providing for a process that can go on and on.  It is important that timelines are in place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the point the Minister has made about his amendment No. 14, which provides for consultation with the joint Oireachtas committee.  Amendment No. 15, in the name of Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, refers to the Minister.  There is a presumption that Ministers are accountable to the Oireachtas.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is splitting hairs.  Implicit in his remarks is the suggestion that sending a report to an Oireachtas committee is the same as sending it to the Oireachtas, but it is not the same.  The work of committees is part of the parliamentary process.  The most important aspect of that process is the degree to which Ministers are accountable to the House during Question Time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>A similar degree of accountability cannot be associated with Oireachtas committees.  It depends on how the committee in question operates.  Some Ministers see Oireachtas committees as appendages of their Departments.  We have had that experience in the past.  Oireachtas committees are part of Parliament and as parliamentary bodies, their role is to safeguard the interests of the public and, ultimately, the Minister.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s amendment is much better than the Minister&rsquo;s amendment.  It gives the Minister short and succinct instructions.  Having received the draft strategy, the Minister&rsquo;s options will be to:</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) approve the draft,</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) approve it with modifications,</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>c</i>) instruct that it be resubmitted to him or her in a modified form for approval, or</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>d</i>) refuse to approve it.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendment No. 15 goes on to make it clear that in all cases &ldquo;the Minister shall present the draft transport strategy to a Committee of the Oireachtas for approval&rdquo;.  It sets out its intention in a more precise manner than the Minister&rsquo;s amendment.  I know this matter was discussed previously.  The Minister&rsquo;s amendment represents an attempt to alleviate the concerns that have been expressed previously by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.  The Deputy&rsquo;s amendment is better because it is more concise.  It anticipates to a greater extent where responsibility is most likely to begin and end if there is a major tragedy.  I hope such a thing will not happen.  Will the relevant Oireachtas committee deal with it?  No, it will not.  The Minister will deal with it in the House, where it is supposed to be dealt with.</P>
        <P>This issue has arisen on many occasions in the past.  I believe the relevant committee is important.  We accept the frailties of Ministers in terms of making time available etc.  I presume <Col N="58"/>Ministers attend committee meetings wherever possible.  However, business is conducted on a daily basis in the House.  The four-week period provided for in this legislation could expire during the holidays and the committee would be able to do little or nothing in such circumstances.  I ask the Minister to re-examine the possibility of accepting Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s important amendment, the contents of which were discussed previously.  I do not want to delay the House this evening.  The amendment reiterates the eminence of ministerial responsibility, from which ministerial accountability to the House automatically follows.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately and tragically, there has been a tendency in recent times to avoid issues that are deemed to be the responsibility of some external agency.  That has been evident in responses to parliamentary questions.  It seems that it is part and parcel of Government policy.  Nobody ever refers to any given matter as being the responsibility of the Joint Committee on Transport.  The Minister will say from now on that certain matters are the responsibility of the Dublin transport authority.  It is right that the committee can discuss various matters &mdash; it can debate amendments to legislation etc. &mdash; but it does not have specific responsibilities of this nature.  I ask the Minister to consider whether he can accept this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the few minutes remaining to us before this debate is guillotined, it is appropriate that we are focusing on what is probably the key problem with the Bill as it stands.  Amendment No. 14 in the name of the Minister does not resolve the problem in question, which is the lack of responsibility to this House.  The Labour Party, with Fine Gael, helped to establish the previous Dublin transport authority over 20 years ago.  I was hoping to be in a position to express the support of my party for the new authority, but I cannot do so because the legislation establishing it does not provide for enough accountability and democracy.  I would be interested to know how soon the Minister expects to be in a position to appoint the chief executive and the board of the authority.  When will it be up and running?  That is the big question the transport workers asked me when I met them last night.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Will we face the same kind of nonsense in our dealings with the Dublin transport authority that we have to endure when dealing with the National Roads Authority and other bodies?  The Health Service Executive is the best example of a body that is cited as an obstacle when we want the Minister to give us information.  I do not refer to operational information or information about individual cases, but about certain aspects of major policies.  The Ceann Comhairle rules that we are out of order when we challenge Ministers on their failures to give us such information.  We have had a dismal and unacceptable experience with the HSE and the NRA in the past four or five years.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s amendment seeks to ensure that the Oireachtas committee will be able to make some input into the major strategic transport plan which will affect the future of a whole generation of people in the greater Dublin region, the east Leinster region and the whole of the country.  The amendment adds to the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, which I welcome as a little step forward in involving the joint committee in these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a tiny timorous step forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, it does not give the joint committee a fundamental role.  The committee should be able to add its ha&rsquo;penny worth to the debate.  Its view should be referred to the Minister for a final invigilation.  I think Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd is trying to achieve a real engagement of that nature.  We are used to such engagement on constitutional grounds at the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member.  Deputy Durkan is a long-standing and distinguished former member of the committee, which has a role in signing off <Col N="59"/>on important investigations, some of which we have discussed in the past six or nine months.  The other Oireachtas committees do not have such a fundamental role.  The Oireachtas has a very poor committee structure, in general and it will be necessary to address that in the context of D&aacute;il reform.  This Bill should be amended so that it gives the Joint Committee on Transport an elevated role in fundamental strategic transport planning in the seven or eight counties in which the authority will be involved in the coming months.  I support Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s amendment.  The Minister should go a step further and give the Joint Committee on Transport a real role and teeth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have gone as far as I can on this matter and I do not wish to rehearse the arguments again.  Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s point in all of this was that in the event of a major tragedy who would be answerable for it.  Certainly the Joint Committee on Transport would not be answerable, it would be the Minister.  On that basis we have got the balance right.  I acknowledge what Deputies acknowledge that we have moved a good deal but it is as far as we can go.</P>

	<P>The date, 19 May, was a very bleak day for residents in O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Dominick Street Lower and St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate.  On that day, Dublin City Council announced that the public private partnership agreements for the regeneration of these estates had effectively collapsed and that there was no plan B to be put in place.  Unbelievably, Bernard McNamara took to the national airwaves seeking sympathy for his plight, while the residents were left to look on stunned, devastated and counting the loss not just of promised new homes, but of the community and social infrastructure that was to help build new communities in these areas.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party motion tonight provides a formula for the Government to resolve the housing crises caused by the collapse of the public private partnership agreements between McNamara and Company and Dublin City Council.  It also offers the Government a template to move the construction industry away from the saturated private residential market into the social and affordable housing market, which has been starved of resources and largely neglected during the boom years of the Celtic tiger.</P>
        <P>It is incredible to think that while new records were set each year for the construction of private houses and apartments, culminating in more than 90,000 housing units last year, local authority housing lists were worsening and affordable housing demand was going through the roof.  As the rich added to their property portfolios with city pads and holiday homes funded by 100% mortgages at low interest rates and by 100% tax breaks, those who were in dire need of housing were largely forgotten.  Social and affordable housing dried up and the waiting lists lengthened.</P>
        <P>Every three years, Dublin City Council conducts an assessment of housing needs.  In 2005 the assessment showed that there were 18,582 applications for social housing accommodation in the city council&rsquo;s administrative area alone.  Three years later the figures, yet to be released, reveal a 13% increase to over 21,000.  The assessment of high or urgent housing need increased in the same period from 5,500 to approximately 6,700, representing an even sharper increase of 22%.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the demand in the affordable housing sector has spiralled out of control.  As fewer couples and families could afford the exorbitant house prices fuelled by speculation and tax breaks, the demand for affordable housing rose dramatically.  In April 2008, Dublin City Council had more than 8,000 affordable housing applications, with a pitifully small number of units of accommodation coming on stream for the occasional lottery.  The council could not cope with the demand and simply closed its doors to new business, leaving thousands of young couples and young families out in the cold with no hope of purchasing a home of their own.</P>
        <P>The new rental accommodation scheme, or RAS, has also ground to a halt.  To qualify for RAS a tenant has to be at least 18 months in receipt of rent supplement.  Up to 26 February 2008, when I received a reply from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the HSE had identified to local authorities across the country more than 30,000 long-term recipients of rent supplement entitled to be transferred into the RAS scheme.  However, in 2007 the rental accommodation scheme in Dublin City Council had closed its doors to new applicants.  Unable to cope with the numbers of applicants, the scheme has ground to a halt.  Those of us in this House who hold regular clinics and deal with housing issues know that there is an accommodation crisis in social and affordable housing provision throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Exchequer surplus of the boom years could have been used to provide shelter for all, but there was no Taoiseach, Minister for Finance or Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with the vision to act effectively.  The money was squandered, mass<Col N="64"/>aging the already bloated private construction sector which is now stranded like a beached whale.  The best opportunity in the history of the State to clear our social housing lists was missed.  Local authorities became over-dependent on housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide social and affordable housing.  This was never the intention of that section.  Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was intended as a means of supplementing local authority supply.  It was not intented to replace new social housing.</P>
        <P>It is against this stark background of social housing inertia that Dublin City Council considered a regeneration programme for rundown housing estates in the context of the Government&rsquo;s National Development Plan in 2002-06.  In the same year the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Agreements) Act 2002 was passed.  The public private partnership as the vehicle for delivering community regeneration was born.  The idea was to engage the private sector in a joint venture with the local authority in funding, planning and delivering a package of private, affordable and social housing and community facilities with the minimum cost and risk to the local authority and maximum benefit to the community.  Unfortunately it was to prove too good to be true.  However, at the time the communities involved in O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Lower Dominick Street and St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate did not know that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regeneration boards were established and community representatives were chosen.  Public meetings and workshops were held.  Wide-ranging consultation was embarked upon.  Men and, in particular, women sat down with the developer and the local authority to plan their new accommodation, their new playgrounds, their new cr&egrave;ches, their new streets and their new community centres.  They were prepared to live through those years of planning, demolition and reconstruction.  They were prepared to vacate their own flats so that a block of flats could become vacant and be demolished.  They were prepared to be patient and to put up with the major inconvenience so the new vision of regeneration with quality homes and quality facilities would become a reality for their children.  As three quarters of the tenants involved are lone parents, mainly women, there is a further issue of gender equity that needs to be addressed in finding a solution.</P>
        <P>Six years of participation and enthusiasm in the case of the 280 families in O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and 120 families in Lower Dominick Street have now been shattered by the collapse of the public private partnership agreements.  There is little value in us poring over the entrails for three hours tonight and tomorrow night and blaming the developer or the local authority.  Bernard McNamara and Dublin City Council can do that in their own good time and in whatever forum they choose.  However, the third party to the partnership, namely, the residents, who are totally blameless and the victims of the collapse, must be at the centre of our deliberations tonight and tomorrow night.  It is their welfare and their futures alone that we should be concerned with now.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party is of the view that the present PPP agreements for O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Lower Dominick Street and St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate have no future and should be given a decent burial immediately.  The people who can do that are the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is present.  I am sure backbenchers in the Government ranks echo our sympathy for the plight of the residents of St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street.  We have framed the motion in such a way that there is no criticism of the Government or any other political party.  Rather all Deputies can rally around and support a frank and practical approach to resolving this crisis.  The Government through the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should take direct responsibility for funding and delivering the long-awaited social and affordable housing projects with the agreed community facilities.</P><Col N="65"/>
        <P>Tonight and tomorrow night the Labour Party is calling on the Government to put the people of O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate and Lower Dominick Street first.  Men, women and children who have suffered appalling conditions for many years in the promise of a brighter future must not be further disadvantaged by the present downturn in the economy.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can take this opportunity to act and be the first to commit the Government to a new economic initiative in the interests of the people affected.  Alternatively, the Government can remain paralysed and petrified like a rabbit in the glare of the headlights.  We have presented the Minister with a practical way forward that bolsters the economy, creates employment, delivers on the regeneration commitments and puts the residents of O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Lower Dominick Street and St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate first.  He should respond positively and act now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate.  I want to highlight the many difficulties that arise from a lack of coherent policy for the city of Dublin.  These range from the impact of the public private partnerships to the need for integration, the need for the provision of homes, not just houses, and the effect of poor housing on the lives of those who experience it.  I take this opportunity to welcome the residents of St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, in particular my colleague, Councillor John Gallagher, who are in the Gallery to hear the debate.  They are in the front line and the people for whom we must have most concern.  I understand that people from O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and perhaps Lower Dominick Street are also here, and I welcome them.</P>
        <P>Public private partnerships have provided for the Government a convenient vehicle for a number of projects around this city.  However, when it comes to housing the outcome for the most part has been negative.  The collapse of the public private partnerships across Dublin city should be considered a body blow to the regeneration of areas which have experienced the bad times, even through the heady days of the Celtic tiger.  St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in my constituency has faced many challenges throughout the years since it was built in 1969.  I do not want to dwell on the problems that plagued the estate, but suffice it to say there is a very strong case for immediate action from the Government and the city council to redress the balance.</P>
        <P>Although the PPP model was not everyone&rsquo;s ideal scenario for these development, and it must be acknowledged there was some disquiet amongst local residents at the scale of the development and the number of private dwellings, at least it was considered to be progress.  However, in the case of St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate the frailties of the PPP process were starkly highlighted when the developer decided to pull out of the partnership, leaving the residents high and dry as happened in O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Lower Dominick Street.</P>
        <P>I quote from an article by Fr. Peter McVerry published recently in a periodical called <i>Working Notes</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">The value of the land donated to the developer far exceeds the value of the social housing provided, thus transferring a very valuable asset, owned by the state, into private hands.  In the case of St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, the value of the land handed over to the developer was estimated at over &euro;100 million while the value of the social housing which the local authority was to receive in return was about &euro;14 million.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Members can see why there were reservations and how the developer was going to do nicely from that arrangement.  However, any progress is to be welcomed at this point.  The St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate project was to be the regeneration that would provide 165 social and 75 affordable units.  Some 165 families who were on the social housing list were to be housed in a brand new, top class development or so they thought.  Many of these would have been from these estates originally and would be given the opportunity to return.  Others would be from <Col N="66"/>the Dublin City Council housing list.  We know all too well from recent programmes such as &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; the conditions in which some people live while they await housing.  As Deputy Costello said any of us who have advice clinics in the city of Dublin know exactly what the housing problems are like.  Along with other Deputies in this House, I receive representations from people on the housing lists on an almost daily basis.  We all hear of the desperate plight of some people seeking accommodation.  However, these were the people who were to be housed in the new developments.</P>
        <P>Some 75 people from amongst the more than 8,000 people on Dublin City Council&rsquo;s affordable housing list would have been given houses here.  These were young families and people who were priced out of the market due to the rampant house price inflation particularly in Dublin over the past 15 years.  It offered people the opportunity to own their own home close to the city centre, in many cases in the area where they grew up.  These 75 affordable houses would have helped add to the mix of people in the wider community of Rialto, Kilmainham and Inchicore and helped to develop a more sustainable community not based on commuting from Westmeath or Carlow but instead living and working in the city.  The addition of private housing on site would also have led to a real mix of residents.  This was a move away from the previous housing strategy which grouped social housing units together and led in some cases to social stratification.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Instead of the promised development we have seen these projects collapse.  The developer has pulled out of the proposed developments, leaving everyone empty handed, the local community in particular, but also the city council and the Government.  The reasons given for the withdrawal by the developer are particularly frustrating.  That the requirement to build apartments that are family friendly, large enough to live in long term and energy efficient is the reason for withdrawal is flabbergasting.  Development laws in this country have for decades been a joke.  The small box apartments so favoured by developers to maximise the number of apartments they can sell are not sustainable housing stock.  In Dublin South-Central a developer wants to demolish a block of apartments he built only a decade ago under the section 23 scheme.  The reason given is the poor quality of the apartments.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council, supported by Labour councillors, has taken a forward-thinking step to insist future apartment stock in the city is of high quality with adequate storage space and room to house a family.  The increased energy efficiency requirements are another positive and necessary step.  Oil is over $140 a barrel and rising.  Energy costs will continue to rise long after a developer has finished a site.  It is only right that developers are required to ensure houses are constructed to the highest possible standards.</P>
        <P>Developers benefited the most out of the housing boom.  I accept they brought much employment and stimulus to the economy.  Nevertheless, they were happy to take super profits during the good times and, in some cases, walked away from developments half finished.  Now the super profits are gone, developers are complaining because a higher standard of sustainable development is required.</P>
        <P>Even with the loss of apartments due to the higher standards, the developer in St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate was given the opportunity to build and sell 449 units located beside a Luas line only a short distance from the city centre which is expanding westwards.  This project must be seen as a golden opportunity for developers seeking work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The money spent on these projects must also be accounted for.  The total spend by Dublin City Council was over &euro;6.1 million on the five public private partnership projects, with &euro;2.6 million spent on St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate alone.  What is there to show for this?  A stalled project for which there is no concrete proposal and a community left in limbo while it waits for its <Col N="67"/>area to be regenerated.  Up to 165 people on the social housing list and 75 on the affordable housing list will not be offered homes for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>If the Government cannot get projects right in the good times, then I fear for its record as we face into a period of economic uncertainty for the first time in two decades.  Will it be the weakest, the poorest and the most marginalised who will suffer?  The manner the Government deals with the St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate project and other stalled public private partnerships will show its determination to address the serious housing social and regeneration issues which afflict Dublin.  Places to live in should be homes and not just houses.  The Government has an obligation to ensure the people who have been left out of the loop through the failure of the public private partnership in St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate are provided with homes that are part of a community, of the highest quality and good for everyone.</P>
        <P>Together with education, housing as part of a strong community, with the community having a real say, is one of the key ways to tackle many problems such as anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and other crimes that blight our society.  It is not enough for local authorities to provide information sessions, however well designed or well intentioned.  They must tell people what they need.  They must be prepared to engage, consult and listen to the people who know what poor housing is about and respond to their needs.</P>
        <P>It is up to the Government to repair the damage done in these failed public private partnership projects and give the people the assurance they will get their new homes and not be left to wait indefinitely for that to happen.  Is it not ironic the developer who pulled the plug on these public private partnerships is allowed to walk away without any sanctions or penalties?  Is it not time, at the very least, to review the relationships between developers, the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in all public private partnership arrangements, to ensure public money is not washed down the drain while the developer moves on to the next project?</P>
        <P>Fatima Mansions in the Dublin South-Central constituency is an example of how good design and integration works.  The project, admittedly a public private partnership, is almost at a conclusion.  It is agreed the provision of new housing and the social agenda around the bricks and mortar is a successful one for the tenants.  However, what is the cost to the State?  The developer provided 150 units of social housing and approximately 450 private dwellings, in return for 14 acres of high-value land, near the city centre and on the LUAS line.  It was valuable property by any standards.  The value of the land was estimated at approximately &euro;100 million while that of the social housing units was approximately &euro;23 million, not a bad profit for the risk that the developer undertook.</P>
        <P>It might sound strange but I lay little blame with the developer for the disaster of the public private partnership regeneration projects.  He is after all a businessman who has been allowed the freedom to call it whatever way he wants when it comes to delivering the promised housing.  Was it promised and under what conditions?  What exactly was the nature of the agreement?  The residents and board members believed the regeneration project was about to begin.  Where was the local authority and what kind of conditions were imposed that allowed a developer simply saunter off into the sunset with no sanction or penalty?</P>
        <P>The challenge for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is to reorganise and restructure the approach to public housing, whether social or affordable, to ensure the taxpayer gets value for money.  He must examine clinically the value of public private partnerships.  Most importantly he must ensure the housing list is reduced so those who have been living on false hopes for up to eight years have some realistic chance of getting a home to live in before they reach their golden years.</P><Col N="68"/>
        <P>The residents of St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Lower Dominick Street have had the rug pulled from under their feet.  I call on the Minister to redress the balance and ensure the residents are put first.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this important Private Members&rsquo; motion from the Labour Party.  It is not only important for the residents of the affected areas but for the future of Dublin&rsquo;s local authorities and Ireland&rsquo;s social housing plans.  The recent collapse of the five urban regeneration projects in Dublin has shown up a failure predicted by many when the State decided to use public private partnerships to deliver social housing.  When the recent collapse was announced I, along with several other Members, raised concerns and hoped the Government would step in as a matter of urgency to give some hope to those affected.  That hope has not yet come from the Government benches.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting &euro;6 million has already been spent by Dublin City Council in preparation for the agreed re-development projects, only one of which McNamara developers intends to proceed with.  Dublin City Council did not have &euro;6 million to waste, which is a matter of concern.  If the Government had examined another method to deliver social housing, that &euro;6 million could have been better used.</P>
        <P>Public private partnership has absolutely failed to deliver regeneration in Dublin city.  It is absolutely astonishing that the Government has not re-evaluated the future of PPPs in light of recent experiences including those of communities in St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Sean McDermott Street, Dominick Street, Infirmary Road and in other areas which were sitting waiting for regeneration processes to begin.  At this stage that needs to happen quickly.  I gave a figure of &euro;6 million spent by Dublin City Council.  No figure has been put on the thousands, if not millions, of community and voluntary hours spent by residents in preparation, through negotiation and consultation, for the regeneration of their areas.  Of course, no financial figure can be put on the loss of hope experienced by thousands of mothers and fathers in all of these communities, who simply wanted to rear their children in decent homes, with proper facilities.</P>
        <P>Councillor Christy Burke, one of my colleagues in the north inner city, related earlier to me how one resident reflected her experiences to him today.  The resident, Nadine, from O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, may be in the Public Gallery.  She captured well the experience of quite a number of residents who have had similar experiences, as relayed to me.  Her son was four when she began to talk to him of the hope of new facilities, a new home and a better future.  Her child is now 14, indicating how much time that community has invested in the O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens regeneration project.  What age will he be when eventually O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens is redeveloped and regenerated?</P>
        <P>Following a proposal last week from the same colleague, Councillor Christy Burke, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, urban renewal and development, Deputy Michael Finneran, agreed to meet with Dublin city councillors to discuss the latest crisis as regards the delivery of social and affordable housing for the city.  The Minister of State has not confirmed when this meeting will take place.  It is imperative that it happens within the next two weeks.  If it occurs any later it is unacceptable and will suggest the Minister of State is not taking seriously his responsibility for delivering urban housing to those most in need.  It is strange it has not happened by now, as it should have within days of the collapse of these PPPs.</P>
        <P>The withdrawal of McNamara Construction from these contracts has caused a crisis within the communities that were due for regeneration.  A key factor in the crisis is that the Government has allowed this to happen by attempting to privatise functions which were essentially the responsibility of the State, through local authorities such as Dublin City Council.  The five communities at the centre of the McNamara fiasco &mdash; we can add Finglas village &mdash; are not <Col N="69"/>the only ones affected by these actions.  We have yet to see the ramifications for the communities who have long awaited delivery on the promise of regeneration programmes.  The Government should now do the decent thing and give a commitment to underwrite five projects to renew confidence in the affected communities, stimulate the construction industry in the city and deliver promised social and affordable housing to areas of disadvantage that gained nothing from the Celtic tiger.  It must take charge of the five projects and ensure the much needed social and affordable housing is delivered, as well as the rest of the promised regeneration.  It was more than a question of redeveloping various flat complexes, it was about the regeneration of whole areas.</P>
        <P>We in Sinn F&eacute;in have consistently called on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan and the Taoiseach to visit these areas and talk to residents to see for themselves the devastating effects these failed PPP enterprises have caused.  To my knowledge none of the aforementioned has bothered to visit any of the complexes affected and that is a disgrace.  The residents are still waiting and would wish to see the Ministers concerned bright and early tomorrow morning, if they are willing to bother their arse.  I have visited a number of other communities as well which were promised that they were next in line &mdash; St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens, Dolphin House, Charlemont Street and others that are planning regeneration.  The concern in those communities, also, is that the failure will affect their promised regeneration programmes.  They are downhearted and need Government and Dublin City Council management to boost their confidence in regeneration processes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have consistently warned that developing social housing using PPPs was not a viable option.  Private developers have no interest in catering for social need and are merely concerned with how the market will boost their profits.  That is their job, but it is not ours to supply them with valuable sites where they can cream off land that should have been allocated for social housing.  This charade has gone on for too long and the Government needs to recognise it.  Social housing units will not be built by themselves.  It is an insult to the people of those areas designated for regeneration that they should be left in unsuitable, inappropriate and inadequate accommodation for a non-specific period into the future while their promised homes await completion &mdash; or even start-up.</P>
        <P>In Dominick Street this morning I was told some 18 bedsits were still occupied there.  Bedsits are supposed to be illegal at this stage, yet Dublin City Council is still housing people in them who had hoped they would have new homes in the future.  I presume many people are in bedsits in other areas as well that were earmarked for regeneration.  If one lives in St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, Inchicore one must wait and see whether one&rsquo;s home will ever be built.  One looks out at the wasteland in front of the flats and prays that maybe sometime somebody will wake up and see the light.  Many of those people are living in near-empty blocks at this stage, and I urge the Minister of State to take the time, even just driving by if he is too busy, to look out the car window and he will see what I am talking about.</P>
        <P>Regeneration was flagged as the answer to all the problems within certain communities who received nothing from the Celtic tiger.  We were told, to a fanfare of announcements on regeneration projects, that the Government was finally addressing the needs of socially disadvantaged areas.  Now the Celtic tiger has drawn its last breath, and the most vulnerable in society are again the first to lose out.  Intended was not just a regeneration of buildings or flats, but the redevelopment of whole communities, and in particular the giving of hope and proper futures to the children within them.  The Government should, as a matter of urgent priority, change the policy to ensure PPPs are no longer used to provide social housing.  It does not work.  All the PPPs suggest there is failure by successive Governments in using the resources provided by the recent economic growth for social programmes that serve the population. <Col N="70"/> Instead, they have given a large proportion of those resources back to the corporations and wealthy developers and now regeneration communities are being forced to shoulder the burden of the failure of this policy.  The developer never carries any risk attached to the project, as can be seen by the fact that McNamara can walk away from this unscathed and take up other Government projects, which are nice and profitable, such as building prisons.  That says it all.</P>
        <P>PPPs are inefficient and more expensive, yet the Government is willing to pay for the building of prisons under this process, but not for social housing.  This debacle shows that privatisation is at the core of the Government agenda.  PPPs are always a &ldquo;buy now, pay later&rdquo; deal.  Without fail, they are more expensive.  The Government can always borrow at better rates than the private sector, so what is the purpose of PPPs, other than to ensure that the people who bankroll the policy makers in these parties ultimately get a better deal?</P>
        <P>On a positive note, there is a solution.  The Government can set up regeneration companies, underwritten by the State.  It was stated that it would cost &euro;900 million to proceed with all five projects.  Those projects were to supply nearly 500 social units, more than 1,000 private units and several hundred affordable units, with ancillary services, shops, community centres and local council offices.  A State company or city council company could build and sell the private and affordable homes, recouping the social housing cost from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which would have to foot that bill in any event if we were to tackle the housing crisis in this city.  Such housing provision would succeed in creating employment for hundreds if not thousands of construction workers for up to five years, thus keeping vulnerable skilled workers off the dole queues, stimulating a flagging industry and providing a gain in terms of tax returns from those who pay PRSI and PAYE.</P>
        <P>If one were to combine the net return to the State from such tax returns, the foregone dole payments and the proceeds from the sale of private apartments, that figure would add up to nearly, or more than, the original figure of &euro;900 million.  That is a business proposition for the Minister to consider to get the Government out of the hole it dug for itself when it agreed to go down the PPP route.  The Minister must seriously consider that proposition because I cannot envisage any other proposal in this regard, other than the State reinvolving itself in a social housing project and giving the necessary money to Dublin City Council or some other social housing provider to deal with what it was meant to do.</P>
        <P>Vision is needed to deliver for the communities that the Government has let down.  Mr. McNamara can walk away.  I am not putting any faith in him and I am not blaming him.  He is a greedy developer, as are most developers.  The Government and Dublin City Council supported him in this regard and, therefore, the Government must act and underwrite these projects.  The people of Dublin cannot be left in limbo during the summer months.  The Government must act and it must do so today.</P>

	<P>This evening&rsquo;s debate concerns an issue that goes to the heart of how we, as a modern and caring society, deal with complex issues involving the revitalisation of communities, communities that, for a variety of reasons, may not have benefited to the same extent as others from the significant social and economic changes that have taken place in this country in the past 20 years.</P><Col N="72"/>
        <P>I acknowledge the genuine concerns of the Deputies opposite and their long-standing commitment to the communities they represent.  I hope they too will accept that they do not have a monopoly in this regard and that I and my colleagues on this side of the House are equally concerned for the communities involved.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that some of the previous speakers stated that what we are discussing is too serious an issue to turn into a political football.  I have no doubt that there may be differences between the approach taken by the Government and the Opposition and I am happy that this debate be used as an opportunity to explore those differences.  However, I would like to think that all Deputies in this House share the fundamental aim of building strong, sustainable communities.</P>
        <P>In regard to a remark made by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, my party does not receive a single cent from any developer.  There was an implication in his remark that we were somehow bank-rolling the people involved, but that is simply not the case.</P>

	<P>Yes.  I apologise for it not being circulated.  We have not received copies of it yet.  Some of what I am about to say is not contained in my script.  I am simply responding to what has been said.  The point was made by some speakers that a developer may walk away from a signed contract at any stage without incurring penalties, but I take this opportunity to assure them that that is not the case.  The contract agreements for housing PPP projects are extremely comprehensive legal documents which deal with a range of circumstances around default by any party to the contract or lack of agreement between the parties.  I emphasise, however, that these matters of contract breakdown must be treated with the utmost sensitivity, as I as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government am not a party to any contract.  That is an important point.  Inappropriate interventions could compromise the ability of the local authority to exercise the terms of the existing contract.  This is the process in which the city council is now engaged. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, some of the contracts were not signed but they were so advanced that the residents and everybody engaged in the process were at the point where it was their understanding that a regeneration project was about to go ahead.  In that case, the developer, as I understand it, was able to walk away from the project without incurring the imposition of sanctions or penalties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, who has the delegated functions in regard to the housing area, will deal in more detail with the Dublin City Council projects.  I want to use my time this evening to set out some of the very complex issues <Col N="73"/>that are involved in undertaking large-scale regeneration projects and to outline clearly the Government&rsquo;s position on regeneration which seeks to address those complexities.</P>
        <P>At the start I want to be clear in regard to my personal commitment and that of the Government to the broad regeneration process and to the regeneration programme being undertaken by Dublin City Council, in particular. In recent years we have seen a very significant growth in the funding committed to social housing in general and more particularly to regeneration projects.  Since 2003, the Exchequer support for the main social housing investment programme, including improvements to the existing stock, has increased from just over &euro;600 million to &euro;1.2 billion in 2008.  Some &euro;200 million of this year&rsquo;s funding is earmarked to support a range of regeneration and remedial programmes.  Coupled with resources provided by local authorities, I estimate that the total investment in the improvement of the local authority housing stock this year will exceed &euro;350 million.</P>
        <P>As we all know, the international economic climate has changed dramatically during the past 12 months and in this country we are facing difficult choices about where to direct public resources.  It is certainly my intention, as Minister with responsibility for housing matters at the Cabinet table, to do everything possible to ensure that we maintain the necessary programme of public investment in housing in the years ahead.  Within the parameters of whatever resources are available, I will continue to give a high priority to regeneration.</P>
        <P>The regeneration of existing local authority estates that, for a variety of reasons, are failing the communities they are meant to serve is a major objective of Government policy, as set out in the Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities policy document published last year.  Apart from the Ballymun regeneration scheme, which has been under way since 1998, there are a range of projects at different stages of progress in Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Dublin.  There are also a number of smaller, if no less important, projects in planning for towns such as Sligo, Dundalk and Tralee.</P>
        <P>I would like to think that there is broad agreement on all sides of this debate about what we are trying to achieve through the regeneration programme.  Clearly, the condition of some local authority housing estates, particularly some of the larger estates, represents a significant public policy failure stretching over a period of decades.  The conditions involved are a blight on the lives of those who live there and, in many areas, give rise to a range of significant social problems.  Yet, within these estates are found strong and vibrant communities which, despite the difficult living conditions that they face, will prove to be the foundation on which successful regeneration can be built.</P>
        <P>What does regeneration mean?  This is a crucial question as the answer will determine whether we are successful in our ambitions.  It cannot be just about rebuilding public housing with a limited range of community facilities.  This point was made by previous speakers.  This has been tried before and it has failed, in some areas, miserably.  What is clearly required is a much more holistic approach, focused on countering the issues of social deprivation and engaging a much wider range of stakeholders.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>At the heart of this new approach should be the aim of creating sustainable communities based on a mixed tenure model.  Mixed tenure helps bring income to an area, gives employment and provides the critical mass that supports a broader range of commercial and social services that all the community can access.  There is no shortage of research in the UK and elsewhere that clearly supports this approach.  I can certainly point to plenty of examples of large mono-tenure public housing estates in Ireland and internationally, with inadequate provision of the essential social infrastructure, that have fallen victim to deprivation.  In this country we also have experience of trying to fix complex social issues by carrying out remedial works to houses and flat complexes, often not to great effect.</P><Col N="74"/>
        <P>In setting out our stall from the beginning it should be clear that we do not believe regeneration can be achieved by simply trying to improve the physical environment.  This will at best buy a little time but it will not address the key social problems and it would be an opportunity lost.  We must have as our aim the building of a new, mixed and, ultimately, sustainable community.  This brings us to the tricky question of how best to achieve this objective.  If one aims for the creation of communities with a mix of public and private housing, local employment opportunities and access to services, one must engage the private sector.  Local authorities are not generally in the business of providing housing for the private market, setting up enterprises or providing purely commercial services.</P>
        <P>A number of approaches could be taken to procuring regeneration projects.  For larger areas such as Ballymun and the major local authority estates in Limerick, Sligo and Dundalk, the standard approach is for the local authority or a specialist agency to set out an overall master plan for the area.  Within this area they use a variety of methods to underpin the development, namely, standard public sector construction, the sale of plots of land to the private sector for development, public private partnerships and various forms of joint venture arrangements.  For smaller regeneration projects &mdash; this would apply in particular to the regeneration of single estates or flat complexes &mdash; a PPP model is often used as a means of ensuring the proper integration of the public and private housing and the provision of ancillary commercial facilities.</P>
        <P>One must remember that just about all social housing built for local authorities and the voluntary housing sector is ultimately delivered by private companies, as is much of the design, planning and project management expertise. This is unlikely to change.  The issue, therefore, is what form of contract with the private sector the State should put in place that has the best chance of getting the desired results.  If the question comes down to how best to engage the private sector, the reason the PPP model is often used is that it provides a method of procurement that allocates risk to the party that is best able to manage it.  In the case of private housing and commercial services, this is generally the private sector.</P>
        <P>Regarding the particular type of PPP used to deliver regeneration, it is worth noting that this is not typical of PPPs in general.  The classic public private partnership involves a long-term contract, with or without the commitment of private finance, whereby a private sector company provides services traditionally undertaken by the State, paid for through annual payments over the life of the contract.  PPPs in housing are quite different and are what are more properly termed design-build-finance contracts in which the private finance component is provided through the sale of private housing units and the development of commercial opportunities.  Planning, construction and demand risk resides primarily with the private contractor.  It is, however, intended as a partnership so there is some sharing of risk.  For the State, there is always the danger that the project will fail if the conditions underlying the partnership change.  The terms of the contract will try to make this less likely but in the end the approach is built around both parties seeking to achieve a common objective in partnership.</P>
        <P>What are the potential benefits of a partnership approach?  There are three main reasons for using the PPP model.  The first is that it can release synergies through the closer ties between the different elements in the project.  Design can be more closely tied in with management and maintenance, non-profit activities can be sustained by those of a commercial nature, one party can be made responsible for delivery rather than having this spread across a number of different bodies and so on.</P>
        <P>The second potential benefit comes from the introduction of fresh ideas and innovative thinking in addressing complex problems.  Although the public sector has a responsibility to set the broad parameters for the regeneration, it does not always have all the answers.  Project <Col N="75"/>implementation, in particular, benefits from broadening the range of inputs to the process.  The private sector, voluntary bodies and the community have a part to play in expanding the capacity to deliver on the objective.  Public private partnerships can provide additional funding which can permit an expansion of ambition within the project or release funding for elsewhere in the housing programme.  Given the more constrained state of the public finances, this benefit cannot be overlooked.</P>
        <P>For each development, and often for individual elements within a regeneration scheme, decisions have to be taken about the appropriate form of procurement. The PPP contract is just one model that in certain circumstances is capable of delivering the private sector input that is needed if the project is to succeed.  The Fatima Mansions regeneration is one good example of how this can work very well.  Even where the PPP model is chosen this does not mean that the process cannot be improved.  I have set up a working group with representatives of Dublin City Council, the Department of Finance, the National Development Finance Agency, the Affordable Homes Partnership and my Department.  This group is to look again at the way PPP projects are carried out within the housing sector and report back to me with recommendations for improvements as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Regarding the lessons to be learned from the Dublin City Council projects, issues have been raised regarding the dominance of one developer in all the projects involved.  This matter can be examined within the overall constraints of the rules governing public procurement.  Another area that will be examined is the responsibility for planning risk, which in this case would seem to have resulted in serious delays in the projects.  I have also asked the working group to consider what actions can be taken to simplify the PPP process, which has been subject to charges of being overly complex and legalistic, a point the Deputies opposite made.  As I indicated at the outset, I will leave it to my ministerial colleague to deal with the specifics of the Dublin regeneration projects. I reiterate my personal commitment to the central role of regeneration within housing policy and to continuing my Department&rsquo;s active engagement with Dublin City Council in support of its efforts to get the projects involved moving forward as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the comments of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, in acknowledging the importance of the issues at the core of this evening&rsquo;s debate and reiterate the clearly articulated commitment of Dublin City Council on the priority which attaches to the tenants living in the affected estates.</P>
        <P>In my role as Minister of State with responsibility for housing, urban renewal and developing areas, I am constantly reminded of the need for a holistic approach to the challenges arising in addressing issues of disadvantage.  History tells us very clearly that it is wholly inadequate to focus purely on physical regeneration in the form of new social housing.  We have to address the wider social issues that affect the communities concerned and do so in a co-ordinated manner, engaging all the relevant stakeholders and service providers.</P>
        <P>It is important that I place the matter of housing-related public private partnerships in their wider social housing policy context.  The use of the housing-related PPP model is just one of a range of mechanisms available to housing authorities to facilitate the delivery of social housing to households that have an identified housing need.  In the first instance, my Department supports an extensive capital investment programme through which Exchequer funding is made available to local authorities.  In addition to the normal construction programmes of local authorities and voluntary bodies, the Part V mechanism is becoming an increasingly important element in the social housing investment programme and one which, it must be emphasised, also meets our national housing policy objective of mixed-tenure housing.  Through the rental <Col N="76"/>accommodation scheme, we have seen a substantial increase in the level of long-term leasing arrangements being used to meet the housing needs of individuals and families.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made in recent times in scaling up the social housing investment programme.  Last year alone, the main local authority house-building programme saw the construction of 5,000 new dwellings, the acquisition of 2,000 units, including through Part V arrangements, and almost 800 new dwellings leased under the rental accommodation scheme.  This year, my Department is providing a record investment of over &euro;1.2 billion in the construction and acquisition programme, as well as for the regeneration of existing local authority stock.  This year, my Department is providing a record investment of over &euro;1.2 billion in the construction and acquisition programme, as well as for the regeneration of existing local authority stock.</P>
        <P>Given that this evening&rsquo;s debate is focused on issues relating to housing in Dublin city, it is important to note that the issues surrounding the PPP projects do not affect the delivery by the council of its wider, and very ambitious, social housing programme for 2008.  This programme of housing construction and regeneration, for which my Department has allocated &euro;250 million, will see the delivery of 350 new starts and approximately 630 completions, as well as the continuation of support for the regeneration of Ballymun and the refurbishment of a number of other inner city flat complexes.</P>
        <P>The current PPP regeneration programme nationally consists of 18 live projects at various stages of procurement and delivery in various locations, primarily in the Dublin region.  These are considered to have the capacity to yield an additional 2,500 social houses as well as 2,000 affordable and 4,000 private units over a period of years.</P>
        <P>The PPP housing model used in this type of project is, at its simplest, based on the local authority optimising the use of its existing land holdings to leverage private finance to deliver integrated developments and to distribute project risk across all the parties involved.  In many cases it also involves the contractor providing office, retail and recreational facilities.  These projects, from a social perspective, represent an effective way of supporting the development of sustainable communities as they automatically make provision for social, income and tenure mix through the inclusion of private housing, community facilities and commercial development.</P>
        <P>We need only look as far as the Fatima Mansions project which has seen the complete regeneration of previously run-down blocks of 364 inner city flats with a socially disadvantaged community into a vibrant new development in the centre of the city.  The completed regeneration of Fatima Mansions will see 615 new dwellings, with a mix of social, private and affordable housing.  A substantial community centre with a swimming pool, a fitness centre and a cr&egrave;che alongside some state-of-the-art all-weather pitches have been completed as part of the first phase.  The second and final phase is due for completion by the end of 2009 and as well as the completion of the social, affordable and private units, will provide for retail and other commercial outlets.  It is also envisaged that space will be allocated within the development for local enterprise initiatives to support the social and economic regeneration of the area.</P>
        <P>I mentioned that there are 18 live housing-related PPP projects at various stages of progress nationally.  These projects are not taken on lightly and must go through a rigorous assessment to determine whether they are suitable for the PPP process.  The capital appraisal guidelines produced by the Department of Finance require Departments, local authorities and other public bodies to undertake an appraisal of all capital projects prior to any decision to go ahead with the procurement process.  In addition, the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, which has specific expertise in the evaluation of PPP projects, provides financial advice and PPP projects are benchmarked against traditional forms of procurement.</P><Col N="77"/>
        <P>Once the decision to procure a project through the PPP mechanism has been made and agreed with the NDFA and the sanctioning body, it could be said that the real work begins.  This process is replete with checks and balances, not just in terms of Department of Finance guidelines but also EU procurement legislation.  In addition, each PPP project is overseen by a project board charged with providing strategic oversight and consisting of representatives of the local authority, the NDFA and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  An independent process auditor is appointed for larger projects and the procurement of independent legal advice is also a prerequisite under the current guidelines.</P>
        <P>Before I leave the issue of process, I wish to respond to one of the points raised in the Labour Party motion regarding the involvement of a single contractor in all five projects.  In a fair public procurement process each individual tender is considered on its own merits.  To mitigate against exposure to increased risk, the public sector seeks assurances as to the financial capabilities of the prospective bidders and their ability to fulfil the terms of the contract.  This is done at an early stage in the tender process, with advice from the NDFA.  Notwithstanding the various checks and balances that exist, my Department will consider what further measures may be required, within the constraints of the rules governing public procurement.</P>
        <P>It may be useful to the House if I provide some clarification on the five projects and their status within the Dublin City Council PPP regeneration programme.  Since the announcement in May by Dublin City Council that these projects would not now go ahead as planned, my Department has been working closely with the council as it examines options for ensuring the regeneration of these areas.  At present, the council is engaged in a full examination of all the implications of the evolving situation, following the initial indications by the developer that, in his view, increased apartment sizes and energy requirements had rendered the projects unviable in the current market.</P>
        <P>Of the five projects, only three involve signed contracts with the developer, namely, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Infirmary Road and Convent Lands.  While the last two projects are brownfield sites, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens is a full-scale regeneration scheme, with 186 families remaining on the estate.  I understand that Dublin City Council is prioritising these families under its allocations policy to provide them with suitable accommodation pending the completion of the regeneration project.</P>
        <P>The remaining two projects at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate and Dominick Street are in a different position as no contracts have been signed.  The council has entered into correspondence with the developer to try to agree an acceptable way through which the local authority can move forward and examine other avenues for progressing the projects.  Arising from recent indications by the council, I am hopeful that the outstanding matters will be resolved shortly, thus enabling the council to move forward.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the council that a number of households in St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate have agreed to move to alternative accommodation since May, with just 18 households remaining.  The council has also indicated that sufficient alternative accommodation has been identified for these families and offers are being made on an ongoing basis.  The council has also met the regeneration boards for these areas to apprise them of the current situation.</P>
        <P>At this stage, it is difficult to comment on the possible outcomes of the council&rsquo;s efforts and I certainly do not wish to prejudice the process in any way.  The council is still engaged with the developer on the three schemes for which there are signed contracts, with the indications now being that a mediation process will be initiated in relation to two of the projects to bring matters to a conclusion.</P>
        <P>Again, I express my support for the communities living in these complexes and emphasise that the residents of these areas continue to be at the centre of all our considerations.  As a <Col N="78"/>demonstration of this and of my support for the council&rsquo;s efforts to bring matters to a conclusion, I have met representatives of the Dominick Street community and will visit O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate later this month.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council, for its part, has undertaken to examine all the housing-related PPP projects currently on its books to determine whether they will be affected by the current market situation.  I am hopeful that an examination of these will show that they will not be affected and that they can proceed as planned.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="5" />
        <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I am conscious of my responsibilities in determining any potential negative impact on the wider PPP housing model.  Accordingly, the factors cited as influencing the decision of the developers must be carefully considered.  As the Minister outlined, a multi-agency group has been established to examine the model and the impact of the current market on the ongoing viability of this mechanism for delivering sustainable communities.  To date, the group has met twice and I expect to be presented with its report on the matter this autumn.</P>
        <P>Despite this, it is clear that we will still need private enterprise in whatever form it takes if we are to achieve our objective of building sustainable, mixed communities.  It is not acceptable for us to return to the age of large, single tenure social housing estates with poor social support services, which we now know contribute to economic and social deprivation of the areas concerned.  Whatever we do in the future, we simply cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Labour Party motion relating to the five regeneration projects that have been the subject of considerable difficulty, particularly for the residents and the people who look forward to getting their new homes in time arising from these proposals which were brought forward by Dublin City Council through the PPP process.  </P>
        <P>Dublin City Council identified the PPP process as the best method of delivering the regeneration project.  I do not think any of the residents would care how it was delivered as long as it was delivered.  Nobody cares at the end of the day whether it is public or private expenditure as long as the job is done.  The council selected the property developer, Bernard McNamara, to redevelop all the various proposals.  It is somewhat surprising that one would put all one&rsquo;s eggs in one basket.  Perhaps the first lesson that can be learned from this process is that, regardless of the climate, it is rather difficult to expect one developer to deliver on time and on budget on all such major developments to the tune of &euro;900 million.</P>
        <P>Under the original plan, the developer was to build approximately 1,800 new homes between the five sites.  It was an attractive deal to the council as the property developer had proven expertise in planning, design and construction.  In return for undertaking the design and construction, the developer was to retain approximately 800 units and sell them on the open market.  That was when the jam was supposed to arrive.  Unfortunately, however, for the purposes of the regeneration projects, all the consultation that had taken place, the goodwill the residents had given this project and the fair wind it was getting in respect of approvals, it did not turn out that way.  As Deputies Costello and Upton rightly pointed out, when the breeze arrived on the open market climate, the people depending on the social and affordable aspect of the housing were the first to suffer.</P><Col N="79"/>
        <P>There is no doubt that the developer decided to pull out because he could not sell the private end of the site as quickly as possible for the amount of money he anticipated he would get.  It is very disconcerting that this would happen, particularly for the people whose hopes of having a new community and new homes, a win-win situation for all concerned, were built up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt that the major contraction of the housing market in the past 18 months is the reason for the derailing of the PPP project, but I would not throw out the PPP project completely because of that.  Even though the motion states that its proposers have difficulty with the PPP project, I understand that it is for this particular project and these five regeneration areas rather than anything else.  I have been in contact with Dublin City Council about this.  Seven-day letters have been issued in respect of two sites involving Mr. McNamara and mediation is taking place in respect of two others.  Mr. McNamara is proposing to go ahead with one site, but we do not know whether that will happen.  He has received sufficient time from Dublin City Council to come up with alternative proposals but it does not seem that he will do so.</P>
        <P>It will be interesting to see whether Dublin City Council pursues the contractual obligation laid down through that process to see whether it can get some of the money back.  I suspect that there will be some <i>quid pro quo</i> in the context of mediation to get the job up and running as quickly as possible.  If one was to again go through all the various processes through which this particular deal has gone, it would be another year before we would get anything up and running with a new developer.</P>
        <P>What Dublin City Council is trying to do is the right way to go.  It should get the developer in, see what can be salvaged at this stage, seek mediation and other projects and go to the underbidder to see what can be done in respect of pricing.  That is the best way we can salvage things.  I hope that the Minister will be proactive in ensuring that the quickest possible deals are turned around in respect of the regeneration of these areas.  At the end of the day, people want a result rather than commitments, promises and new processes that will take an indeterminate amount of time.  They certainly do not want to end up in the High Court which, as we know, is an expensive and very time-consuming process.  Waiting two or three years down the line for some site to be regenerated is not exactly what anybody here wants.  I hope that goodwill will be evident in how the process will pan out at the end of the day.</P>
        <P>The council hopes to salvage parts of the deal and is still working with the property developer to that end.  The clauses in the Labour Party motion reflect the frustrated comments of the local groups.  These relate to what were the reasoning and wisdom behind giving the contract for five large projects, which would affect thousands of residents if things went wrong, as they have, to a single property developer.  In addition, why did the contracts not contain stronger penalty clauses which would concentrate the mind of any developer?</P>
        <P>It is interesting that the developer did not decide to sell the Burlington Hotel.  Did nothing go wrong with this?  A similar situation pertained to the Allianz building at the rear of the Burlington Hotel, probably because of its preferential location.  He would have had to concentrate his mind on some of those assets if more punitive clauses had been included to ensure that he could not walk away in the manner in which he has done.</P>
        <P>The local residents have a point in respect of all these matters, which have brought about the motion before the House tonight.  The motion calls for whatever steps that are necessary to be taken to ensure that Mr. McNamara is removed from the process.  I think we would be better off getting something out of it if we can, salvaging something even with Mr. McNamara at this stage, going to the underbidders as quickly as possible and getting a deal as quickly as possible</P><Col N="80"/>
        <P>I would say to the Minister of State that social and affordable housing is not working as satisfactorily as it was.  The Part V process is not working because Dublin City Council and other local authorities do not have the money to buy out their contractual obligations from the developers on many of these sites.  In respect of the 20% allocation, one might as well have 5% or 50% at this stage because there is no money.  The Department has capped the amount of money a local authority can spend on any contractual obligations.  All local authorities are telling public representatives that they do not have enough money to fulfil existing contracts on the basis of the money they have been allocated in 2008.  Many contracts on water, sewerage and housing will not go ahead this year.  Contracts are fine, it works both ways and there must be goodwill on all sides, but, equally, the money must be there to achieve the objective.</P>
        <P>What we want to see as a result of this Labour Party motion is that truth is established about where we can go from here.  We want to see an opportunity for people to be certain that a route to a successful conclusion exists and that the five regeneration projects will go ahead rather than have just another opportunity to say &ldquo;if this&rdquo; and &ldquo;if that&rdquo; in a conditional sense about the potential of the future.  People want to know if these projects are dead or alive and where they go from here.  I hope that the Minister and his Department will be very proactive in ensuring that the people who have been painstakingly involved in the five regeneration projects are given that truth and certainty regardless of how unpalatable that might be in some cases in order to map out the route ahead to bring these to a successful conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss tonight&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion.  I thank the Labour Party for bringing this motion, which needs to be taken seriously by the Government, before the House.</P>
        <P>Public private partnerships were identified by Dublin City Council as the best method of delivering regeneration projects.  The property developer, Bernard McNamara was selected by the council to redevelop all five projects at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Infirmary Road, Dominick Street and Se&aacute;n McDermott Street.  The total value of all five PPP projects was &euro;900 million.</P>
        <P>However, the dreams of all residents concerned were shattered in May 2008, when it was widely reported in the media that these five PPPs in Dublin had collapsed.  Under the original plan the developer was to build 1,800 new homes between the five sites.  It was an attractive deal to the council and to the property developer, who had the expertise in the planning and design of major property development projects.  In return for undertaking the design and construction the developers were to retain about 800 units and sell them, while the remainder would be used by Dublin City Council for social and affordable housing, replacing some old flat complexes.  The PPP model delivered other projects such as the Fatima Mansions project.  It is a grand model when times are good but when times are tightening the weaknesses in the PPP model must be examined.</P>
        <P>The collapse of the PPP agreements between Dublin City Council and a property developer was a blow to the most vulnerable who were trying to buy a new home for the first time.  These people currently live in substandard accommodation and have been waiting between five and eight years to be re-housed.  It is unacceptable to be in this situation.  The rehousing of these people must be urgently examined.</P>
        <P>We must ask ourselves why the developer pulled out of these partnerships.  The slowdown in the housing market in the past 18 months is the main reason for the derailing of the regeneration PPPs.  Changes to the planning guidelines, making apartment sizes much larger, are to be welcomed.  The size of apartments was far too small, particularly with young families living in <Col N="81"/>apartments.  Obviously the increase in apartments sizes would hit the profit margin of the developer and was another reason why he pulled out.</P>
        <P>In May, when it was revealed that these public private partnerships had collapsed, the Government stated it would conduct a review of the rules concerning public private partnerships.  Today we are still awaiting this review.  When will the House be furnished with the results of this review?</P>
        <P>While I agree with the majority of points in the Labour Party motion, I disagree with the call on the Government to take the necessary steps to remove the developer from the five projects.  As of today, 8 July, Dublin City Council has formally terminated its contracts with Bernard McNamara for two out of the five regeneration projects, St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate and Dominick Street.  The developer is to proceed with at least one project and could potentially proceed with another two.</P>
        <P>It was recently confirmed that the property developer will proceed with the redevelopment of the convent garden lands on Sean McDermott Street.  The council and the property developer are also to enter into mediation on the two other housing projects on Infirmary Road and O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens.  However, the Council is threatening to take Mr. McNamara to the High Court if mediation is not successful.  It would be ludicrous to remove Mr. McNamara from all PPP contracts, particularly in view of the long delay.  The council must examine the originally unsuccessful bidders to get them involved in the other projects.</P>
        <P>I find it extremely careless on the Government&rsquo;s part not to have in place strict penalties if developers renege on PPP arrangements.  I echo the Labour Party&rsquo;s call on the Government to implement sufficient sanctions.  What was the reasoning and wisdom behind giving a single property developer the contract for five regeneration projects, when there was a chance the contract would not be fulfilled?  Stronger penalties should be written into the contract to ensure a developer could not walk away as easily as did Mr. McNamara.  On these grounds the local residents have every right to be disillusioned because these projects are in doubt.  We must restrict the amount of PPPs that a single developer can be granted at any given time.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Hogan stated, the waiting lists for social and affordable housing in Dublin are the highest in the country and with this PPP collapse, those on the housing list face an uncertain future.  We now see the first large bloc of victims of the economic downturn, those who are always the first to suffer in these situations.  We must look out for these people and ensure the PPPs continue.</P>
        <P>I am concerned at the huge waiting lists for social and affordable housing.  This Government has failed to deliver on affordable housing.  In May, Dublin City Council closed its affordable housing scheme for eight months, a decision which was a major setback for all those who are eager to make a start on the property ladder.  At that time, I appealed to Dublin City Council to revisit its plans and hire more staff to deal with the backlog of applications rather than penalising the genuine homeowners looking to make it to the first rung of the property ladder.  I was shocked that Dublin City Council closed its affordable housing scheme.  Some 8,000 people remain on this waiting list and it is not good enough that this was allowed to happen.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council&rsquo;s decision was terrible news and a drawback for all those who are eager to make a start on the property ladder.  While I recognise that there has been a huge increase in applications over the past couple of years, the application system must be thoroughly re-assessed, with more background checks necessary to prevent abuses of the system.  I appeal to Dublin City Council to hire more staff to deal with the backlog of applications, particularly for young people.  The affordable housing initiative has failed.  There are currently 750 people on the affordable housing list in Fingal County Council.  There are 3,000 people on the affordable <Col N="82"/>housing list in South Dublin County Council and 4,500 on the affordable housing list in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</P>
        <P>This Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government established the affordable housing partnership in 2005 with the sole aim of increasing the supply of affordable housing through the release of a series of State and local authority lands.  The 2007 NDP target for affordable housing was 5,700 units while, shamefully, only 1,800 units were delivered.  The affordable housing partnership has failed to deliver for those on waiting lists.  It is only a talking shop and another waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
        <P>It is beyond belief that there is no centralised affordable housing waiting list in operation at present.  As a result, it is not possible to ascertain a true figure of those currently on affordable housing lists.  In addition, the way in which local authorities manage applications results in differences in terms of who is counted on their waiting lists.  For instance, in some local authority areas, all applications are added to the list.  When housing becomes available, eligibility is assessed and housing offered accordingly.  The result is an imprecise list.  At the same time, other local authorities assess eligibility in order to add applicants to the waiting list, with the resulting lists being shorter but a more accurate reflection of the number of eligible households waiting.  Of course, just because households are not eligible does not mean they do not have housing needs and this must be considered.  I call on the Minister to instruct local authorities to create one centralised affordable housing list.  I also ask that the Government deliver on its affordable housing targets.</P>
        <P>The announcement of the collapse of five public private partnerships in May sent shockwaves throughout the country, particularly in the communities directly affected by the decision of McNamara Construction.  The residents concerned were devastated as negotiations for the projects had taken years and those affected had their hopes shattered.</P>
        <P>The council and Government must ensure strict penalties are written into future public private partnerships to ensure the developers involved in the 18 other public private partnerships do not walk away and follow suit.  We must ensure the PPPs are watertight and that they continue.  The council must enter into immediate negotiations with the other unsuccessful initial bidders in an attempt to save these public private partnerships.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council must be forced to re-open its affordable housing list.  It is nothing short of a disgrace that it was allowed to close it in the first place.  I also seek a review of the State Authorities (Public Private Partnerships Arrangements) Act 2002.  The Minister must work directly with Dublin City Council to ensure that these public private partnerships go ahead without further delay and every opportunity must be taken with McNamara Construction to salvage those which have a chance of being saved.  I know the Minister is committed to ensuring they go ahead.  We must take action on affordable housing and waiting lists and ensure the PPPs go ahead.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to excise section 1(3) and replace it with the amendment as drafted.

	<P>I appreciate that Deputy Rabbitte has a point with regard to the collective citation for the courts Acts, my Department is involved in a joint project with the Law Reform Commission to codify the courts Acts.  The issue referred to here will be taken into account in this examination.  This is an Intoxicating Liquor Bill rather than a courts Bill.  I cannot accept the amendment.  The reason section 1(3) is in the Bill is because section 7(<i>a</i>) refers to the jurisdiction of the District Court and it must be included to tie in with previous legislation in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not dispute that section 7(<i>a</i>) ought to be included but the critical words are &ldquo;the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts 1961 to 2007&rdquo;.  If the Minister acknowledges that in terms of refurbishment of the law generally this is desirable, I am not sure I entirely understand why then it is not desirable to take it on board here and enshrine it in this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have nothing further to state on this other than this is not the Bill to deal with the collective citation of these Acts.  It will be dealt with when the joint project reaches its finality.  Section 7(<i>a</i>) refers to the District Court having and exercising all the powers and jurisdictions which it has.  It refers to section 77 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924.  This is why it must be indicated in the citation in the Short Title.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister made an important point in his reply to Deputy Rabbitte with regard to codification and further reports pending.  I respectfully suggest we park this Bill until such time as we have further and more lengthy legislation.  Earlier this year, my party indicated we would consent to the passage of an interim measure.  However, since then the situation has changed substantially.  The most important sections of the Bill have been removed and other sections which caused difficulty for the Minister are subject to amendment.

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 2 is consequential on amendments Nos. 54 and 55 and the amendments will be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;<Miles com="is0p1" />&ldquo;Act of 2006&rdquo; means the Criminal Justice Act 2006;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">When introducing the Bill, I announced my intention to table Committee Stage amendments to clarify aspects of the fixed charge penalty arrangements set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  This is the purpose of this group of amendments.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 2 inserts a reference to the Criminal Justice Act 2006 into section 2 of the Bill.  Amendment No. 54 inserts a new section 19 into the Bill and amends section 23A of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 while amendment No. 55 inserts a new section 20 and amends section 23B of the 1994 Act.</P>
        <P>The legal basis for the charge we are discussing is in section 184 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  It has been formally commenced but the arrangements are not yet in operation.  Discussions have taken place with the Garda Commissioner and the necessary administrative arrangements have been finalised.  As a result, I expect to be able to make the necessary regulations introducing these charges shortly after the enactment of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The charges will apply to two of the most common offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  Section 23A applies to offences under section 5 of the 1994 Act, namely, being disorderly in a public place, and section 23B applies to offences under section 4, that is being drunk in a public place.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 54 amends section 23A of the 1994 Act.  As I stated earlier, the changes are technical but they are necessary before the arrangements can come into operation.  The amendments to section 23A cover two issues, namely, the outsourcing of systems of the service of notices and the payments of the charges and the presumption that may be made in proceedings for non-payment that the notice was properly served.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 55 relates to section 23B of the 1994 Act.  Sections 23A and 23B are cross-referenced regarding the administration of the system.  As a result, the same arrangements apply to both sections.  In other words, the changes to administration we discussed in regard to section 23A will apply also to the charges arising under section 23B.  However, a further amendment is required in subsection (2), which also provides for the service of the notice by post in cases where it is not served on the person personally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The difficulty is, as the Minister stated, this is a series of technical and necessary amendments but they are confusing.  The confusion is compounded by the fact that the amendments are dependent on the Minister introducing regulations, which he proposes to do at some time in the future.  We do not know what will be the import of the amendments until the regulations are drafted and the Minister does not know the form of the regulations because he has not turned his mind to them yet.  This is another reason my earlier argument, which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle did not wish to hear, is all the more relevant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to hear it now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda will be empowered to move people on if they are, in the opinion of an officer, drunk and disorderly.  How will people be moved on?  Where will <Col N="85"/>they be moved to?  Will they be moved from one corner to the next corner of a street?  Will they be moved from a park bench to the corner of the street?  Will they be moved from outside the public house to outside the chipper?  The wording is technical and cumbersome and no effort has been made to use language that might be understandable.  How will people be moved on?  Will the Minister provide a practical example of what he thinks, following the enactment of the legislation and the introduction of regulations when he gets around to it, the net effect of these amendments will be in dealing with public disorder?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy referred to the moving on provisions, which are not related to these amendments.  They concern two offences covered by the 1994 Act, namely, being disorderly in a public place and being drunk in a public place and the issue of fixed charge penalties.  Such penalties are notified to the person who commits the offence and, subsequently, he or she receives a notice.  Ultimately, he or she pays a fixed charge penalty similar to the fixed charge penalties for minor driving offences and the payment is made through An Post as the receiving agency.  It is proposed in inserting this provision to remove responsibility from the Garda for the acceptance of cash payments.  The regulations are under preparation.  We are in discussion with the Garda regarding the appropriate charge and it is estimated we will commence them one to two months after the signature of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a great deal of sympathy with Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s remarks because the first I knew about the amendments was when I received them earlier.  They were not provided for in the legislation and I have only recently commended the Minister&rsquo;s worthy civil servants on their prodigious output of legislation.  However, I am always left with the impression that if for some reason or other, such as the resignation of a Taoiseach, we did not enact the legislation this week and returned to it in September,  I could bet my life there would be as many amendments tabled again by the Minister.  It leaves one wondering what was wrong with the Bill, as drafted, if the Minister has to keep thinking up amendments to make it consistent and effective.</P>
        <P>I have no objection to the essence of the amendments, as advised by the Minister.  It sounds like a good idea to take this responsibility off the shoulders of garda&iacute; but I am not sure what the Minister is proposing regarding the operation of this provision.  He outlined the two offences concerned but I am not sure how the penalties will be collected and discharged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The principle is similar to that applied for basic driving offences where a fixed penalty charge is applied.  A notice is served on a person and he or she has 28 days to make the payment.  If it is not made, an additional charge is levied which must be paid within a further period of 28 days and the offender, therefore, must pay an increased penalty.  If he or she does not pay, a prosecution follows.  This is similar to the mechanism for pursuing minor traffic offences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that be spelled out in regulation later?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The receiving agency for penalty charges applied for driving offences is An Post and that more than likely will continue to be the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a slight difference in how this relates to motoring offences.  A car can be traced to a specific person.  People furnish wrong names and addresses too frequently to the Garda and a number of my constituents have contacted my office inquiring as to how they can extract themselves from scenarios where they are being pursued regarding various offences they did not commit.  The provision removes responsibility for collection of the charges from the Garda.  A fine issues and a period of 28 days can elapse followed by <Col N="86"/>another period of 28 days and then a court case.  In the meantime, these charges hang over people whose names have been falsely given for a fixed charge penalty.  How can they extract themselves?  Must they wait until they go to court a number of months later?  Is another mechanism available?  Currently a person deals directly with the garda who is charging or fining him or her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I anticipate when an offence is committed, the garda will take the person to the Garda station where he or she will be cited with a fixed charge penalty.  It would be rare for a person to give a false name in those circumstances.  If he or she did, that would also be an offence, which would have to be investigated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>What will be the practical import of the amendments and the regulations?  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh made a reasonable point.  An alleged offender will be questioned by a garda, presumably at the scene of the public disorder or drunken state.  He or she will be taken to the Garda station and an arrest will be made followed by a caution and a charge.  Is it envisaged the person will be released at that stage into the community?  When will the court hearing take place?  Is it envisaged the regulations will be similar to those relating to driving offences?  Will higher penalties be applied to those who opt to go to court?  If so, that will be in marked difference to the regulations governing driving offences because a vehicle is not involved.  Will the Minister place a greater burden on a person who feels his constitutional right to appear before a court will result in a greater fine or penalty being imposed by virtue of taking such an option?  As we are not clear on these issues, I ask the Minister to take us through them.  It is not sufficient to allow for regulations to be drafted outside the House where it or one of its committees would not have an opportunity to engage in formal discussion.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I could go through section 184 of the Criminal Justice Act, to which we are making technical amendments.  It is a long section that lists the procedures under which fixed charge offences are dealt with by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the 2006 Act?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  No court is involved.  The idea of fixed penalty charges is to try to keep as many people as possible out of court for minor offences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>If a person opts to go to court, will that choice result in a greater penalty?  Will going to court militate against the citizen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be a matter for the court to decide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>What if there is no court?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In driving offences, for example, I do not see the difference between owning and not owning a vehicle.  The amendment is an effort to try to reduce administration, time in court and the time used by the Garda so that relatively minor offences can be indicated.  People would not be brought to court.  However, if the person does not pay after two notices, he or she would be summoned to court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What in the provision is new?  Is it the fixed charge?  Is the Minister claiming that the power to move on someone who is being disorderly, drunk or whatever does not exist?  Is the fixed charge the new aspect that the House is being asked to agree to?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="87"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not new, but this will be the first time it will be applied to public order offences.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 3 is consequential on amendment No. 52.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 52 will be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;<Miles com="is0p1" />&ldquo;Court&rdquo; means the District Court and in relation to any application to the Court means the District Court for the court area in which the premises to which the application relates is situated;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a technical amendment, whereas amendment No. 52 is important.  Under the Minister&rsquo;s proposal, the closing times of licensed premises &mdash; premises with special exemptions, those commonly regarded as nightclubs and those operating with theatre licences &mdash; would be at a fixed hour.  The legislation will give rise to serious public order consequences.  Consequently, the amendment would introduce tiered or sequential closing.  Amendment No. 52 introduces a new concept, that of a nightclub licence.</P>
        <P>Under the Minister&rsquo;s proposal, thousands of people would spill out onto our streets simultaneously, pressurising emergency services, taxi ranks and fast food outlets and giving rise to flash points.  It would create areas in which social disorder would be more likely to occur.  The industry estimates that the country&rsquo;s 500 nightclubs are frequented by approximately 500,000 per week.  Does the Minister believe it to be a good idea to have that many people pouring onto the streets at the same time as the thousands who frequent pubs?  In Dublin city alone, there are 800 pubs.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposes to regulate nightclubs and that industry.  Currently, there is no distinction between a late bar and a club or a venue at which there is drinking, dancing and music.  Amendment No. 52 would allow for the certification of what constitutes a nightclub premises.  Such a premises would operate under strict conditions, which are included in amendment No. 52.  It states: &ldquo;the premises shall only operate for business between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.&rdquo; should a court deem fit on foot of an application.  This is an enabling, rather than a prescriptive, provision.  The nightclub would not operate as a public house or under any other licence during the day.  It would strictly be a nightclub or night venue.  It would also be distinguished from the ordinary seven-day licensed public house by virtue of the fact that its patrons would be subject to a fixed charge admission.</P>
        <P>The premises should provide entertainment through music and dancing.  Much of the late night bar industry is predicated upon a dancing facility that, in many cases, is no more than a fig leaf because there is no requirement that a particular area of the premises be designated for dancing.  Under the Fine Gael amendment, the area reserved solely for dancing must consist of not less than 20% of the club&rsquo;s gross floor area.  To ensure that public disorder is kept to a minimum, the amendment calls for at least two security personnel to be present on the front door with additional security personnel inside the premises during opening hours.</P>
        <P>Since the nightclub licence shall be subject to an annual District Court application in the manner of public house licensing, it will be open to any member of the public or a Garda superintendent in the event of disorder to make objections or allegations of nuisance, noise or disturbance.</P><Col N="88"/>
        <P>The amendment is innovative and would, under strict conditions, meet a demand for night-time music, singing and entertainment.  It would also address an inadequacy, namely, people operating licensed premises under various guises &mdash; theatres, singing venues and seven-day public houses with special exemptions.  It would confine the special exemption to the ordinary seven-day public house, which is in line with the spirit and the letter of the Bill.  It would address the matter of the growth in the number of questionable theatres, which was discussed on Second Stage.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to take the amendment on board.  In previous reforming intoxicating liquor legislation, we did not give full and adequate consideration to these issues, but we have an opportunity to do so now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister will accept these amendments or a version thereof.  He has not had the time or opportunity to reflect on the implications of not doing so.  I carry no can for the nightclub industry; I have no shares in it and I am past the stage of visiting those establishments.  However, the prospect of disgorging the patrons of the nightclubs of this city onto the streets at the same time is positively to invite public disorder.  For many years, the entertainment industry was unable to function satisfactorily because of the absence of public transport.  Since deregulation, the availability of taxis has immensely improved.  The staggered hours we enjoy between the closing times of pubs, establishments with theatre licence and nightclubs means public transport providers are able to cope with the demands on their services.</P>
        <P>In addition, this proposal will impose inordinate strain on other public services.  We in this House seem to believe we have done enough in simply passing a law.  However, a problem with many of the laws we pass is that they are not enforced.  In this case, unless it is enforced, it is valueless.  Public services in Dublin city, whether the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the ambulance service and so on, will be unable to cope with a fixed closing time.  It is unworkable.  There is a certain naivete behind the Minister&rsquo;s efforts.  This is not to impugn his motives in any way.  I share his goals.  However, in a capital city, one of the leading cities of the European Union, the notion that we can regulate the entertainment industry in the fashion proposed is naive.</P>
        <P>No figures were produced in the Dr. Gordon Holmes report or elsewhere as to the contribution made to the problems of public disorder and binge drinking by the activities of the nightclub industry.  I am sure it is not a significant contribution.  When I say there is a certain naivete informing the legislation, I mean that the phenomenon of binge drinking, youth abuse of alcohol and consequent public disorder is complex and that some of the measures in this Bill miss the target.  The Minister accepted as much when he promised to excise the sections relating to early morning opening.  I do not know what the Minister&rsquo;s household is like but I never encountered a teenager in my home heading to an early morning pub at 7 a.m., unless it was on the way home.  Most teenagers  are more likely to surface at midday than to be ready to go to an early house at 7 a.m.  I am confused as to the supposed connection between early houses and the phenomenon we are seeking to combat, which is binge drinking and youth public disorder.</P>
        <P>If the patrons of the nightclubs of this city and other towns and cities throughout the State are disgorged onto the sidewalks at the same time, when public transport cannot be accessed and where they end up congregating outside takeaway joints, we will simply be inviting an increase in public disorder.  In a society where adult entertainment is part and parcel of the way people live, we should consider whether it is reasonable to seek to regulate it to the extent proposed in the Bill.</P><Col N="89"/>
        <P>Given that the Minister&rsquo;s goals in this legislation are undoubtedly admirable, it is a great pity that we will not get a chance to work through all the amendments.  For example, the changes he proposes in regard to theatre licences will cause great hardship and difficulty.  The problem is not that people attending a performance have an opportunity to discuss it afterwards over a drink but rather the abuse of this existing provision.  This is in addition to the punitive system of tariffs introduced by the Minister.  My amendment No. 15 is also designed to facilitate staggered closing hours.  I am convinced that we will regret the implementation of measures which see a return to the bad old days in this city where people staggered out of nightclubs, pubs and theatres and could not hail a taxi in typical Irish weather.  That is not a recipe for improving the current situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister will take these amendments on board.  Although there is scope to improve them further, they succeed in addressing an issue of significant concern.  This is a problem that exists not only in this city but also in small towns throughout the country where everybody spills out of the pubs and onto the streets at the same time to congregate at the one or two chip shops that are open.  People who have consumed alcohol tend to bump into each other and a fracas invariably ensues.</P>
        <P>Staggered opening on a sequential basis allows for greater control over the activities of people who have consumed alcohol in public houses and nightclubs.  It is estimated that some 500,000 people will be converging on the streets at the same time in the towns and cities of Ireland.  Given that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already overstretched, it is an unreasonable proposition that it be tasked with ensuring public order in those circumstances.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 52 would allow for a degree of sequential opening.  This would ensure that people who do not wish to frequent nightclubs can go home secure in the knowledge that transport will be available, whether on a late-night bus, if they are lucky enough to be in Dublin city, or by taxi.  Likewise, by the time people are leaving nightclubs, whether at 3 a.m., 3.30 a.m., 4 a.m. or even later, taxis would be available to take them home.  There would be no large disgorging of people at the same time.  Most people I know wish to go home long before 4 a.m.  While many young people might be able to dance the night away, it is a long time since I have managed to stay out dancing until 4 a.m.</P>
        <P>In a modern society, we must consider what is the appropriate degree of regulation to impose on people&rsquo;s enjoyment.  We must ensure the potential for disorder is reduced while facilitating those who wish to frequent nightclubs and so on.  Part of the proposed amendment would address that.  As it stands, the legislative proposal is a recipe for disaster.  Hopefully that will not happen, however, and the Minister will have the wit to take on board what Deputy Charles Flanagan and others have been trying to point out, that 500,000 people coming on to the streets at the same time will do the exact opposite to what was intended when the Bill was first introduced.  At that time, we were told the legislation was to tackle anti-social behaviour, public disorder, late night drinking and everything associated with it.  I welcome most of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, which will have far-reaching consequences and will hopefully reduce many of the problems in urban areas, particularly those concerning off-licences.  However, the proposal to have everybody coming on to the streets at once will not serve any useful purpose and is a retrograde step.</P>
        <P>If we had had more time to tease out the Bill in committee, including presentations from those working in the drinks industry and hospital staff, we might have been able to come up with a reasonable proposal along the lines of Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s amendment.  That would allow Ireland to be modern, while beginning to tackle the drink culture in our society, including the disorder that occurs every week.  Thankfully, according to the most recent statistics, it has been <Col N="90"/>reduced, but if this Bill is enacted I do not think that reduction will last long.  I believe we will see an increase in drunk and disorderly behaviour, in addition to associated problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment constitutes a sensible approach.  Up to now we have not had any structure in place to deal with nightclubs.  Such clubs have been a phenomenon for a long number of years, having taken off in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  A litany of special exemption orders comes before local courts every week or month and garda&iacute; must attend the courts for this rigmarole.  Everyone knows what is going on, yet we allow it to continue.  Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s amendment No. 52 would put nightclubs on a statutory footing once and for all, which is something we have not done up to now.  I remember debating the matter in this House when we got rid of meals which, in theory, were served in nightclubs.  Officially they were restaurants and one had to consume a meal.  Sadly, I was one of those who frequented nightclubs regularly at the time and in reality slop was dished out to people at all hours of the night.  No one knew what they were getting but it complied with the letter of the law and facilitated that situation.  </P>

	<P>I never noticed.</P>

	<P>He learned from the experience.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The nightclub industry has developed based on loopholes in the existing legislation.  It is about time that we placed it on a proper statutory footing and Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s amendment would do that for the first time.  In that way, such clubs could only open at night-time and would have to charge a fixed admission price.  I do not doubt that the Minister is serious about tackling binge drinking &mdash; everyone in the House is serious about it &mdash; but sequential charging could be examined in this regard.  If one is in a late night pub before 11 p.m. admission is free.  If one goes in after that time, a charge applies.  The cost of drink can vary, with prices progressively rising during the night.  That encourages people to go in early and get filled up with drink as early as possible to avoid the higher costs that apply later.  In that regard, the Minister could examine the topical issue of sequential charging, rather than sequential opening.  </P>
        <P>For the first time, Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s amendment would insert a restriction whereby one fifth of the gross floor area must be for dancing purposes.  We should have proper security standards for personnel and CCTV cameras.  I know of two assaults that took place outside nightclubs but when the people concerned went to get the CCTV footage it transpired that there was no video in the cameras.  If CCTV was provided on a proper legal basis it would protect individuals who frequent such facilities.  As with pub licences, they would have to be renewed annually.  It is important to have sequential closing in place, in addition to placing nightclubs on a statutory legal footing.</P>
        <P>In a later section, the Minister refers to test purchasing but there is an anomaly as to who has ownership of the CCTV footage.  I hope there will be a provision in the legislation whereby if test purchasing takes place, CCTV footage can be confiscated by the individual concerned.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify that because there is not much point in sending in a child under the age of 18 if that footage can then be used to identify or victimise the child at a future date.  That needs to be examined in the context of test purchasing.</P>
        <P>The amendment, however, proposes to address the issue of public order.  As Deputies Rabbitte and Flanagan said, if we put everyone on to the streets at the one time, it will lead to chaos.  In every other country where that provision has been tried, it has failed and it will <Col N="91"/>fail here also.  It will lead to chaos and a litany of public order problems for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Minister should re-examine sequential closing to ensure that there is a natural progression emerging from pubs and nightclubs into public transport and then returning home.  In many of our larger towns and cities, it is virtually impossible to get home by public transport at a late hour.</P>

	<P>I want to make a final point about nightclubs. On Second Stage, I proposed the introduction of a national identity card that is tamper-proof.  The current ID card is not tamper-proof, but an improved one would help to address the problem of under-age drinking.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I too would like to support Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s amendment and I appeal to the Minister to accept it.  When Mr. Holmes addressed our committee, I gave the example where the joint policing committee in Tralee suggested that the bar should close a half hour earlier.  According to the local superintendent, the incidents of public disorder decreased because of that.  However, we were not referring to the two night clubs in the town at that time.</P>
        <P>This is about public order.  It is about preventing flash points all over towns and cities in Ireland.  When people leave the bar, the majority of them will go to a night club.  That can prevent people from crowding around flash points and they have somewhere to go.  By 4 a.m. they will have sobered up.  If that element is taken out, then we could create a major problem, perhaps even mayhem in some cases.</P>
        <P>I know that the Minister listens to people.  If he listens in this instance, he would be making a major contribution.  Sequential closing times are operating in Dublin at the moment, with the agreement of the various night club proprietors.  Apparently, it is very successful.  That example supports this amendment.  The night clubs in my constituency are very well run, as they have high standards and there is always security.  If they are not comfortable, people will not enter them, unlike some bars.  They also provide a very good product.  If there is no time lapse, then night clubs will be no different from bars and we will lose an essential social element.  Deputy Rabbitte also pointed out that they are part of our tourism business.  All over Europe, bars open later at night and Dublin is thriving with tourists.  However, this part of the Bill could be to the detriment of the tourism industry.  I appeal to the Minister to accept Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s proposal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to lend my support to the amendment put forward by Deputy Flanagan.  As a young person who regularly frequents night clubs, I must say that this Bill could do great damage to the entertainment industry and will effectively lock the door on night clubs at a particular time.  That will force young people out onto the street.  If this amendment is not accepted, the Minister will be dealing with an even greater problem in the months to come.  I appeal to him to accept it as it represents common sense.  It is time that night clubs were put on a statutory footing, and this amendment does that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I see a lot of merit in this particular amendment.  The concept of sequential closing is a good one.  A point was made to me from someone in the industry that there could be merit in looking at having a closing time for serving alcohol, with a longer period for drinking up.  That period would not be used by people stocking up on drink to drag things out.  Non-alcoholic beverages, such as tea and coffee, and food could be served and would help people to sober up.  It would slow their exit from night clubs and take the strain off the public transport services such as taxis and so on.</P><Col N="92"/>
        <P>There is a real need to make sure that everybody is not coming onto the streets at the same time.  There should be some more thinking outside the box, like the idea where people could have a single drink just before the sale of alcohol was to cease, without being rushed out of the premises.  They could usefully be encouraged to stay there for non-alcoholic beverages and food.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have thought long and hard about this issue, and I have come to a conclusion based on the figures available to me.  This country has a severe problem with the consumption of alcohol, whether we like it or not.  We have one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the European Union.  In 2006, it was 30% higher than the EU average.  A eurobarometer survey in 2007 indicated that 34% of Irish drinkers consumed at least five drinks on one occasion.  In comparison, just 10% of the rest of Europe reported such a level of consumption on one occasion.  When those people were asked about the frequency of consuming five or more drinks on one occasion, 28% of Europeans stated that they did so at least once a week, while 54% of the Irish respondents did so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People may exaggerate in surveys, but we can also look at the figures for those people <?oasys _dc18- ?>admitted to hospitals with intoxication. Between 1997 and 2002, admissions increased by 76%.<?oasys _dc0- ?> Between 2000 and 2005, there was a 135% increase in juvenile alcohol related offences.</P>
        <P>There seems to be a misunderstanding of the position up until last year.  Night clubs and late bars were legally obliged to close at the same time.  It is only because of the lacuna in the law for theatre licences &mdash; admitted in a Sunday newspaper by a night club owner &mdash; that night clubs could gain an extra hour or two for the sale of alcohol.  I understand that people have to make a living, but I have to take into the account the figures that were brought to the Government&rsquo;s attention last year.  We asked the advisory committee to look at this in a targeted way over a short period of time and we rushed the legislation through so that we could implement the main recommendations of that report.</P>
        <P>Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s amendment would effectively permit night clubs to remain open until 4 a.m.  The fact is that special exemption orders apply to night clubs and the only other vehicle to be used is the theatre licence, of which 76 exist across the country, with 36 of them in Dublin.  The remaining night clubs and late bars were obliged to close at 2.30 a.m., with drinking up time until 3 a.m.  Premises across the Border that apply to the courts to extend their opening hours do so until 1 a.m. on weekdays and midnight on Sundays.  Some 76 theatre licences were granted by the Revenue Commissioners in 2007.  As a result of a court case there was then a rush to apply.  To date this year more than 150 such theatre licences have been issued, with more on the books.  Gordon Holmes&rsquo;s committee strongly recommended that urgent attention be brought to bear on a significant loophole.  The increasing use of theatre licences by nightclubs and late bars to circumvent special exemption order provisions was and continues to be a source of serious concern to the Government and the advisory committee which recommended urgent action.</P>
        <P>Sections 9 and 10 contain proposals to give effect to the recommendations of the advisory group.  In future, holders of theatre licences will be permitted to apply for special exemption orders under the same rules as other licensees.  This is a necessary step in order to address problems arising from the increased availability of such licences and to ensure equality of treatment for all premises operating late at night.  Deputy Naughten referred to some research that indicated that opening up the licensing hours in other jurisdictions has been shown to be beneficial.  The truth is the opposite.  We reviewed what is happening in England and Wales, which provides a salutary lesson for those who would liberalise the licensing laws in the hope of reducing anti-social behaviour.  Late in 2005 when longer opening hours were introduced, <Col N="93"/>British Ministers argued that the aim of longer hours was to reduce disorder when everyone emerged from licensed premises at the same time.  A research report issued by the British Home Office in March 2007 reported that there was no clear evidence that positive benefits had accrued from staggered or better-managed closing times.  It stated that there were no clear signs up to then that the abolition of the standard closing time had significantly reduced problems of disorder.  The report stated that the evidence from those countries that had moved from strict opening hours to a more relaxed regime, such as Australia, New Zealand, Scotland and Iceland is that liberalised regimes tend to result in higher levels of consumption and more alcohol-related problems of crime and disorder.</P>

	<P>It makes a big difference for late public transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In some of my public comments I referred to another recent survey carried out in England by the Local Government Association.  It reported increases in alcohol-related incidences.  For example, half of all police authorities stated that the longer opening hours had simply resulted in incidences occurring later in the night.  The survey of 20 police forces indicated that crimes committed between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. had increased by 22%.  Meanwhile three quarters of the health authorities surveyed have reported increases in spending as a result of the rise in accident and emergency admissions.  The chairman of the Local Government Association is reported as saying that the longer drinking hours have made no impact whatsoever in reducing alcohol-related violence.  He said that the vast majority of councils, police and hospitals have reported no change at all with violent incidences generally just being shifted to later in the evening.</P>
        <P>Based on our levels of alcohol consumption coupled with our unfortunate culture for binge drinking &mdash; I gave some of the figures earlier &mdash; there is no reason to believe that longer opening hours here would lead to any improvement in the levels of anti-social behaviour and public disorder.  On the contrary, there is a likelihood that the situation would worsen.  I have had detailed discussions with the Garda Commissioner and other senior garda&iacute; on the matter.  Their view is that later opening hours for some premises would simply result in people moving from premises to premises as they close.  The reality is that as the pub closes people will go to the late bar and then on to the nightclub.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na strongly preferred the situation that pertained until recently where there were only 36 theatre licences in Dublin.  Up until two years ago the closing time for nightclubs and late bars was 2.30 a.m. apart from on Mondays.</P>
        <P>People refer to staggered opening.  In reality people would be staggering from premises to premises if we gave an opportunity to go from bar to late bar and then on to nightclubs.  Local authorities have some responsibility in this regard.  They were given the power by the Oireachtas in 2003 to give a recommendation to local District Court judges about closing times.  However, no local authority has used this power.  While I understand the difficulty people in the industry have and understand the arguments made, the Bill was in effect designed to reduce the accessibility to and availability of drink in a very targeted way in certain areas.</P>
        <P>The Bill will not be the silver bullet to solve all the problems.  We need to deal with education and instil in the population that what is going on cannot go on forever.  From generation to generation we are now beginning to have one of the worst drinking cultures in the western world.  Following the loosening of the legislation in recent years the situation has got worse and not better.  In this Bill we are merely curtailing the opportunity that certain establishments had to put in theatre licences, which was a loophole to get around the special exemption.  We are not changing in any way the existing time limits for special exemptions, which for some years have been 2.30 a.m. with drinking up time to 3 o&rsquo;clock on most nights and 1 a.m. on Monday mornings.</P><Col N="94"/>
        <P>We had a debate a number of years ago on the Sunday night-Monday morning issue.  The empirical evidence shows that there is a serious problem with abstention from work on Monday mornings.  Before we changed the Monday morning closing time, there was a significant difficulty in getting people to work on a Monday morning.  Unfortunately I cannot accept the amendment.  I can understand that the Deputies on the far side of the House are genuinely interested in the issue of public disorder in their communities.  However, given the evidence on our doorstep and in other countries around the world, their suggestion to allow nightclubs to open, in effect, until 4 a.m. is the wrong way to go.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not hold with what the Minister has said for a number of reasons.  I regret that we will not have the opportunity to debate the matter fully.  The Minister talked at great length about the effects of alcohol and the adverse consequences of a drink culture.  He knows that the Government of which he has been a member for many years has no alcohol strategy at all.  When the Department of Health and Children recommends one thing it is completely ignored by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is merely dealing with the manner in which alcohol is available through licensed premises.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has its own view regarding the alcohol industry.</P>
        <P>When the Minister lectures the House about the adverse consequences of alcohol he knows that a lack of joined-up thinking between the Departments of Health and Children, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform have given rise to the situation.  The matter of opening hours is a very small player in adverse consequences of drink and the drinking society we have.  It is not fair for a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ignore the role of his colleagues in the Department of Health and Children.  It is important to remember there is no strategy.  The 25 or 26 recommendations of the 2004 task force on alcohol were all ignored.  Even though the Minister was in another Department at the time he was a member of the Government.  It is a bit rich of him to lecture Members of this House on the issue.</P>
        <P>The second point the Minister made was in respect of public disorder.  There is no greater recipe for public disorder than having all licensed premises close at the same time.  The Minister referred to a comparative analysis with other jurisdictions.  The jurisdiction used was Northern Ireland, where until recently on a Sunday a child could not play in a park and a newspaper could not be bought.  The Minister should not use a comparison with the jurisdiction north of the Border, a different society with a different attitude to the retail sector and alcoholic beverages.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about defending the industry and the need to look after the workers.  It is unfair and disingenuous for the Minister to say any amendment from this side of the House is to protect jobs or that industry.  Not one Member other than the Minister has used this argument.  It is spurious and without foundation.</P>

	<P>No, they are not.  The Minister&rsquo;s party has shirked from dealing with the concept of a nightclub in a regulatory manner.  He is in denial and does not accept such a concept exists.  It will just be a fig leaf of a dancing area in an ordinary seven-day public licensed premises.</P><Col N="95"/>
        <P>The Minister facilitated loopholes with theatre licenses until a committee told him to call a halt.  If it were not for that particular amendment, the Bill would contain no new provisions.  The Minister should not talk about introducing regulation when the Government has consistently shirked from dealing with change in the retailing of alcohol to meet the needs of a modern society.</P>
        <P>My amendment would have for the first time recognised in law the status of a nightclub.  There is no current distinction between a nightclub and a bar.  It has not been recognised in law when it should be.  It is regrettable the Minister is not taking this point on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is regrettable the Minister is not taking on board the main points of Deputy Charles Flanagan&rsquo;s amendment.  There is a need to describe a nightclub in legal terms.  I agree there was abuse of theatre licences and special exemptions.  Once a loophole is identified, it will be abused.  There may be a need to close some of the existing loopholes but in doing so it must be recognised that nightclubs exist.  People go to nightclubs to enjoy themselves and not just to get drunk.  Many go to dance, make liaisons and the like.  A separation must be made between those attending an establishment to dance and those going to the pub for relaxation.  Whereas I do not agree with all the provisions contained in Deputy Charles Flanagan&rsquo;s amendment, it has some good points.  If more time were allocated, it could have been teased out with provisions on, say, a separate entrance to a public house and nightclub.</P>
        <P>The Minister will end up with the same if not a worse problem than that he is trying to address with this legislation.  If all licensed premises shut at the same time, even with every member of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rostered to be on patrol at the same time, there will still be public order problems.  The idea is to reduce the number of people coming out of licensed premises at the same time.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>If the existing laws were implemented properly, publicans would not serve intoxicated people who are a danger to themselves.  The Bill addresses the problem of on-the-street drinking which will hopefully reduce public order offences and the potential for them.  The Bill will not address binge drinking and the problem of young people wanting to get out of their faces on drink.  That can only be addressed over the long term through education and ensuring existing laws are implemented in full.  Only then will people have a more mature attitude to alcohol consumption in nightclubs and so forth.  Some of the changes in law such as regulation of the private security industry, CCTV on licensed premises and better lighting at exits to nightclubs will have benefits in time to ensure less public disorder.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains some good provisions on the sale of alcohol.  It is a pity this one aspect of the Bill does not address the main problem.  The Minister will have to return with later legislation to define a nightclub rather than it being a glorified pub with a designated corner for dancing.  The industry, the public, the courts and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deserve this.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I suspect part of the problem is that the average age of the clientele attending nightclubs is somewhat lower than the average age of Members in the House tonight.  Members&rsquo; aspirations to do the right thing is one matter but the practicality is entirely different.  The Minister&rsquo;s line about staggered hours was not a bad one, that people would be staggering from one emporium to another if sequential closing were permitted.  The Minister is correct that some of the 500,000 patrons of nightclubs would stagger to another venue if it were open.  Whether the closing time is 1.30 a.m or 3.30 a.m, the same type of client who will stagger to a taxi or another place of entertainment will stagger after 1.30 a.m. as well.  We have all known the phenomenon in the pub of people stocking up with drink because closing time is half an hour earlier, or whatever.  The Minister is right that we have a problem with alcohol in this country.  Anybody who has read the report about the harmful effects of alcohol cannot be but convinced that it is a real issue in our society.  However, we are addressing particular legislation <Col N="96"/>promoted by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor as seeking to address the phenomenon of youthful misuse of alcohol, binge drinking, public disorder and anti-social behaviour.  Quite frankly, the Minister and I are both out of touch if we put the great preponderance of people who go to nightclubs at the weekend &mdash; it is largely a weekend phenomenon &mdash; into that category.  That is not the nature of people who patronise nightclubs.  It is unrealistic to think we can correct the malaise, which we all agree exists, with this type of measure. </P>
        <P>I thought the arguments made in this discussion related to whether this was likely to invite further public disorder and create chaos in the streets in terms of people being disgorged at the same time and creating flashpoints, as well as testing the adequacy of public transport, the capacity of public services to cope and the efficacy of policing at this hour of the night.  Although we did not address the issue in terms of employment and so on, the Minister is right that there is an employment dimension.  I did not make my main arguments on the issue of sequential closing on the basis of the employment considerations, but there are such considerations.  For example, I had representations from a place with a theatre licence in the heart of Temple Bar.  I do not know what type of establishment the Minister would expect to find in Temple Bar, given what it was defined to do &mdash; regardless of whether it achieves this end.  However, the effect of the legislation on this establishment is to reduce the working hours from 31.5 to 23 per week.  If the Minister is the employer, he must acknowledge that this has implications for him trying to maintain structured staffing over the seven-day week.  Remember, there is very little business in these places between Monday and Thursday.  This particular place functions from 11 p.m. until 3 a.m. or 3.30 a.m.  To enforce Sunday closing on it would mean there would not be a Sunday opening, which has other implications as well.</P>
        <P>The Minister is expressing a lack of faith in the maturity of the great majority of people who frequent night places of entertainment because of the actions of a minority.  It is desirable to have a tough regime in such establishments and that staff are trained to deal with the phenomenon of drunkenness.  For that reason, employers have to be able to structure their staffing in such a way to facilitate that.  Otherwise, the issue goes underground, and we are not doing a particularly effective job at enforcing what we have at present.  The notion of trying to change the character of the entire late night entertainment industry in this and other cities, because of the actions of a small minority, will not be effected by law.  The person who resolves to get drunk out of his or her mind in the fastest time possible will do it whether the closing time is midnight or 3 a.m.  I have read no literature that challenges that point.</P>
        <P>We have set ourselves an objective that looks very good, but we have a problem.  Some of the tragedies that occurred in this city did not happen at 3 a.m.  Some of them happened in the evening, while it was still daylight.  I do not believe a Bill such as this will challenge that type of behaviour.  We should have some confidence in the maturity of people frequenting these places to conduct themselves in a proper fashion and allow the industry to structure itself so that there is a certain professionalism about the way it deals with things.  The phenomenon of drunkenness caused by the longer hours, as claimed by the Minister, relates to a minority, and this is more complex than trying to address that minority&rsquo;s and our problems.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept for a minute what Deputy Flanagan says about lack of co-ordination between Departments.  My Department is working very closely with the Department of Health and Children in relation to this and other initiatives on the health side.</P>
        <P>It was clearly indicated when we published the general scheme for consultation in 2005 that we accepted there was a need for nightclub permits.  That legislation will be brought forward towards the end of the year.  The sale of alcohol Bill will involve a codification of the entire law on the sale of alcohol.  We published the proposals in 2005, which included what the Deputy is endeavouring to do here.  However, the difference between what we are bringing forward and what the Deputy proposes is that it is not my intention to move from the existing position <Col N="97"/>of nightclubs and late bars opening until 2.30 a.m., with drinking up time until 3 a.m. on the Monday morning.  I am driven by all of the issues, including the report of the Department of Health and Children on the harm caused by alcohol.  The Deputy acknowledges is an enormous problem.  The figures are frightening and this Bill will not solve all the issues, but we are endeavouring &mdash; as the advisory group indicated we should &mdash; to take urgent action to close a loophole that it is acknowledged exists.</P>
        <P>We can exaggerate all we like about 500,000 people disgorging onto the streets.  The reality is that was happening up until last year.  Nightclubs and late bars only had authority to serve drink up to 2.30 a.m., with drinking up time until 3 a.m.  Last year, there was a dramatic rise in the number of licences, albeit the numbers were relatively small, with 76 in the country and 36 in Dublin.  This year, the figure to date already is 150.  Taking a full year, that means 74 extra premises have an advantage over all the other late bars and night clubs and, in effect, have longer opening hours.  The amendment suggests that this be extended to virtually everybody.</P>
        <P>Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s proposal in regard to a nightclub permit provides that nightclubs would only open at night.  However, the vast majority of nightclub owners who made representations said this provision would not satisfy them; the reason being that all of them already have bar licences.  Therefore, they would not be satisfied with that type of proposal.  In the forthcoming sale of alcohol Bill, we will propose the introduction of a nightclub permit, under which the club would have specific conditions, including the type of dance floor and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is conceding on this point.  He should have said that an hour ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but the only difference between it and a special exemption order is that it would be a yearly permit.  In order words, nightclub owners would only have to renew their permits once a year in the courts because their premises are dedicated nightclubs, whereas the owners of late bars would have to continue to apply for special exemption orders. </P>
        <P>It is not my intention to change the time of closing given that, as a nation, we have an alcohol problem of near epidemic proportions.  The general public are strongly of the view that public disorder would occur as a result of such a change.  Garda&iacute; have given a strong message that they believe the position that pertained up until two years ago whereby under the law late bars and restaurants in effect closed at the same time, would be far better than having staggered opening hours.</P>
        <P>I accept Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s point that not every one of the 500,000 people concerned would go from pub to late bar to nightclub, but I hazard a guess that a substantial proportion of them would go from one to the other.  That has been the nature of what has happened.  I accept that a relatively younger population go to these nightclubs.  Like most people in this House, I am a parent and I see what is going on in society.  This provision is not only targeted at young people, but on most occasions when they go out young people do not come home until 5 a.m. or 6 a.m.  The reality is they are in public houses.  We give out about the fact that there is disorder on our streets at different times.  Garda&iacute; have given a strong message that from a resources point of view, it is better that people come out of these premises within a concentrated period.</P>
        <P>No one has denied the empirical evidence found in virtually every study that has been carried out in regard the extension of opening hours.  The case has been proven, as it was in the UK recently, that such a change has had an adverse effect rather than the type of effect people had intended.</P>

        <P>Amendment No. 13 gives effect to my proposal that off-sales of alcohol will not be permitted in such premises before 10.30 a.m.  Amendments Nos. 4, 10 and 11 are consequential changes.</P>
        <P>The substance of the changes proposed by Deputy Flanagan in amendments Nos. 5 and 16 are already included in the Government amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister has done here.  It was an act of folly in the first instance to single out the early morning houses for closure in the manner envisaged.  I am pleased the representations made to the Minister from this side of the House and from people outside the House have given a stay of execution to the early houses but I do not know for how long that will continue.  </P>
        <P>There had never been any indication or evidence that these houses were sources of public disorder or had attracted the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a way that might give rise to public order difficulties.  It was mentioned there was a problem with the early houses being used by people on their way home from late night venues but, from speaking to proprietors and early morning licence holders, I was interested to note that special arrangements had been in place for some time and that this was not a problem.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister is not proceeding with the closure of the early houses.  My amendment No. 5 is probably dealt with in a later ministerial amendment.  Accordingly, I will withdraw my amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with what has been said.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has changed his mind about this provision.  My amendment seeks to oppose the section and to <Col N="99"/>have the <i>status quo </i>apply, but I accept the Minister&rsquo;s distinction between alcohol consumption on the premises and the selling of alcohol for consumption off the premises for the relevant hours is probably a better construction.</P>
        <P>I am puzzled as to why this provision was included in the Bill.  I instanced my puzzlement earlier about the fact that no young people, to my knowledge, have ever found themselves in early morning houses and the streets are usually well aired before they surface.  I asked the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor whether it was reasonable to posit the notion of a housewife in Castleknock who could not access a bottle of wine early in the morning and whether she would get into her soft top and drive down the docks in the hope that she could get a bottle in that location.  I do not believe that scenario is realistic.  I cannot see the connection between the stated purpose of this Bill and the inclusion of this section and for that reason I am glad the Minister has changed his mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for their comments.  This measure was not aimed at young people.  It was a proposal from the advisory committee because some evidence was brought to its attention that in some instances public disorder issues arose where, particularly in Dublin, people were queuing to get into some of these premises to feed their alcohol problem and that this was leading to public disorder in and around those public houses.  </P>
        <P>I listened to representations from Members on all sides of the House and to those of representatives of some of the interest groups.  It was clearly indicated to me subsequently when I spoke to the Garda Commissioner that, by and large, garda&iacute; did not have a difficulty with the early opening houses, except in a number of specific instances.  As a result of an undertaking given by the vintners&rsquo; associations and an understanding with garda&iacute; in regard to the specific early opening houses that would be looked at very closely, it was agreed we would return to the position whereby the existing houses would be allowed to continue to open early but no new premises would be allowed to do so.  A Member of this House and my party suggested a way of dealing with the off-sale to equate it with off-licences and that was a good compromise.</P>

        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, before section 4, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;4.&mdash;Section 17 of the Act of 2003 is amended by&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) after subsection (3) the insertion of the following new subsection:</P>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;(4) Any person other than a licensee who takes intoxicating liquor from a licensed premise for the purpose of its being sold on the account, or for the benefit of profit shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) in subsection (4) the insertion of the words &ldquo;or other person&rdquo; after &ldquo;licensee&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This has been of concern to a number of people for a while.  It is the &ldquo;dial a can&rdquo; system whereby in recent years pubs and off-licences have circulated fliers stating that one can tele<Col N="100"/>phone an order which a courier or somebody in the employ of the premises would deliver to one&rsquo;s door.  The problem I have with that is that far too frequently young people use this.  When the delivery person arrives and sees people aged 14, 15 or younger at the door, rather than travel all the way back to the off-licence or pub and forgo the tip or delivery fee from the publican or off-licence owner, he or she hands over the drink to the young people.</P>
        <P>I got a commitment from the Minister that under section 17(3) of the 2003 Act it is an offence for a licensee to engage in or permit such activity.  I examined it and could not find that it was that specific.  In this amendment I am trying to ensure it is specific that sales of off-licence goods can happen only on the premises, that one cannot transfer one&rsquo;s licence to an individual who will travel in a car to a location dictated over the telephone and sell drink to whoever is there.  The licence is for a particular premises; that is the purpose of my amendment.  The practice has been highlighted by the Minister and his advisory group.  It needs to be tightened to end this practice once and for all.  There is a difference if the sale is conducted by credit card over the telephone because the money has changed hands and the driver is only making a delivery.  However, where the exchange of funds is at the door, in the park or wherever the delivery has been directed, this needs to be tightened up much more.  Hopefully the wording I propose would deal with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>While I cannot accept the amendment, I have some sympathy with the sentiments expressed in it.  My advice is that &ldquo;dial a can&rdquo; is already illegal.  In its report the group suggested that there should be enforcement of the existing provisions.  It did not recommend any legislative change.  The Garda was represented at chief superintendent level and the group recommended that the Garda target &ldquo;dial a can&rdquo; and similar services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees.  I would expect that the Garda would target those services.  While my advice is that it is already illegal and needs no further legislative change, if something comes to our attention between this and the publication of the sale of alcohol Bill towards the end of this year or in the new year, we will re-examine it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and will look at the sale of alcohol Bill when it is produced.  This applies not just to the licensee.  If I telephone a taxi company and ask a driver to buy drink from an off-licence and deliver it with the agreement that I will pay the taxi fare and the price of the drink, that is a transfer.  That taxi driver is selling on alcohol and that is not illegal because the transaction has happened between the taxi driver and the licensee.  Given that we are short of time I will leave it until the sale of alcohol Bill is produced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to say a word in support of the substance of the amendment before we dispose of it.  If we are talking about the public disorder, anti-social behaviour, vandalism and binge drinking phenomenon, what Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has highlighted contributes much more to dangerous, anti-social behaviour in communities, neighbourhoods and estates than what we have discussed in previous sections of the Bill.  It is a classic example of the point I was trying to make about enacting law here that cannot or will not be enforced.  When the Minister tells Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh that &ldquo;dial a can&rdquo; is already illegal, it is patently obvious to any of us who represent certain communities that it is not being enforced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have nothing further to add.  The recommendation of the report was that the existing legislation should be enforced.  I am prepared to return to it.  In the event of its coming to our attention that there is a difficulty regarding the circumstances Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has indicated, I will take action in the sale of alcohol Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the existing legislation?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="101"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  This is the distinction to which Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh refers.  It makes it an offence for a licensee with intent to evade the conditions of the licence to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>That refers to the licensee, but the licensee would not be taking it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point, but the group did not indicate there was a problem.  However, since Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has raised it, I will be prepared to re-examine it in the context of the sale of alcohol Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not already covered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In those circumstances, under the section there would be the possibility of getting a prosecution or conviction against the licensee but not necessarily the taxi driver.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is most unlikely.  In the cases to which Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred and those that have been commonly reported to us and in the newspapers, there is no question of the licensee taking the goods off the premises.  The licensee engages in the transaction of selling to somebody who comes in as an agent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh links it to a licensed premises.  His amendment reads: &ldquo;Any person other than a licensee who takes intoxicating liquor from a licensed premise for the purpose of its being sold on the account&rdquo;.  It is linked to the licensed premises.  Under existing legislation a licensee would be prosecutable in that instance.  Going on the recommendations of the report, the advisory group has asked that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na examine this and it should be given some time.  I will return to it.  Licensees may not be aware of what is happening in some instances and we can re-examine that.  I will take advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

It carries the penalty of a fine with no maximum limit and imprisonment for life or less as the court may determine or both.  This insertion has been advised by Parliamentary Counsel as an appropriate clarification that the offence is an indictable one.  </P>

	<P>I indicated on Report Stage in this House that I would address the circumstances raised by Members on both sides of the House and bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  This section prohibits the disclosure of information except in specified circumstances.  It will be for the prosecuting authorities and the courts to determine this.  Depending on the nature and seriousness of the offence, a summary offence carries a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or imprisonment of up to six months or both.  An indictable offence carries a fine of up of &euro;50,000 or a maximum of two years imprisonment or both.  The fines and prison terms have been advised by Parliamentary Counsel as appropriate for the offences under this section.  They are separate offences to the main offence dealt with in section 2.

	<P>I stated on Report Stage in this House that I would address the circumstances raised by Members on both sides of the House and bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  This section provides that the making of false or misleading <Col N="104"/>statements or providing false or misleading information to the national and-or international authorities is an offence.  It will be for the prosecuting authorities and the courts to determine this.  Depending on the nature and seriousness of the offence, a summary offence carries a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or imprisonment of up to six months or both.  An indictable offence carries a fine of up to &euro;50,000 or up to two years imprisonment or both.  The fines and prison terms have been advised by Parliamentary Counsel as appropriate for the offences under this section.  They are separate offences to the main offence dealt with in section 2.  They are deemed to be appropriate and commensurate.    </P>

      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter.  I propose that the derogation that will cease in December 2008 be extended beyond that date.  Taking the current costs of fuel into account, it is reasonable to expect the Minister to reconsider the situation that has developed since 1997, when the directive was introduced, and when the then Minister, Deputy Dempsey, verified the extension of the derogation in the Wildlife Act.</P>
        <P>During the recent referendum campaign, it was clear that issues such as this were a major factor in the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is familiar with the situation in Shragh community centre, where those voting in a small rural area voted overwhelmingly &ldquo;No&rdquo;, primarily because of this situation.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has been asked if he will extend the derogation beyond that period.  It is clear that the people are sick to the teeth of overregulation, especially from Europe.  At a recent public meeting, 200 people indicated that they wanted to continue to harvest peat for domestic purposes as they had always done in Clonmoylan bog, outside Woodford.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the designation of certain bogs as SACs and national heritage areas, NHAs, in 1997 and in 2000 was based on unsound interpretation of the habitats directive in 1992.  In 1997 and in 2000, the relevant Ministers designated SACs and NHAs exclusively on scientific grounds.  The Minister who designated certain bogs as SACs in 1997 told D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 13 March 1997 that &ldquo;the habitats directive is a conservation measure and only allows for objections to proposed designations on scientific grounds&rdquo;.  That view was sustained by the subsequent Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, when he introduced his Wildlife (Amendment) Act of 2000.</P>
        <P>The Wildlife (Amendment) Act was signed into law on 18 December 2000.  Both Ministers ignored a number of important provisions in the 1992 directive, which was published on 21 May 1992.  The EU habitats directive declares that its central aim is to &ldquo;promote the maintenance of biodiversity, taking account of economic, social, cultural and regional requirements&rdquo;.  In committing itself to the &ldquo;general objective of sustainable development&rdquo;, the habitats directive acknowledges that &ldquo;the maintenance of such biodiversity may in certain cases require the maintenance, or indeed the encouragement, of human activities&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Ministers responsible for the 1997 and 2000 designations did not take into account the economic, social, cultural or regional requirements of the people of rural Ireland.  They focused exclusively on the scientific grounds.  The 1997 designation does not reflect the EU habitats directive&rsquo;s requirement for the &ldquo;maintenance and encouragement of relevant human activities&rdquo;.</P><Col N="105"/>
        <P Just="Left">The harvesting of turf is a major part of life in rural Ireland, especially for domestic purposes.  No one wants to see the commercial use of those bogs.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, was in the Chamber I pointed out that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in certain parts of rural Ireland was a direct response of the people in rural Ireland who wanted to harvest turf.  I gave an example of the polling booth in the Clonmoylan area where harvesting turf is restricted.</P>
        <P>This is happening at a time when we have an increase of 30% in electricity prices.  In 1997, oil cost $24 per barrel and it is now $140 per barrel.  The Minister cannot turn his back on the situation and condemn many people who depend on the bog for winter heating and domestic purposes.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s prerogative and within his capacity to extend the derogation beyond the current limit, allowing a redemption and an extension of time for those people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify a number of issues regarding the cessation of turf cutting on a relatively small number of designated bogs, which is due to come into effect at the end of this year.  Of the 1,500-1,600 raised bogs, only 139 are designated and only 32 of these are subject to the derogation that lapses this year.  While a similar ten-year derogation period will apply to the balance of the 139 designated bogs, turf cutting may continue as before on the vast majority of bogs.  That message must be sent out loud and clear.  The number of bogs affected by the ending of turf cutting in 2008 is, therefore, very limited.</P>
        <P>The Deputy refers to the interpretations by previous Governments of the habitats directive in 1997 and 2000.  Ireland is required to protect habitats of European importance under the habitats directive 1992.  This directive was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 and the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.  Ireland has nominated certain raised and blanket bogs, which are priority natural habitats under the directive, as candidate SACs.  In addition, Ireland has also designated other raised and blanket bogs as NHAs under the 2000 Wildlife Act.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s raised bogs are of European importance.  Almost all of the active raised bogs in western Europe have disappeared or been severely damaged.  Within Ireland too, most areas of bog have been severely damaged, mainly by turf cutting, but in more recent times by afforestation and overgrazing.  Less than 1% of Ireland&rsquo;s original active raised bog &mdash; bog on which the indigenous flora are still growing and forming peat &mdash; remains.  However, this tiny proportion represents 60% of western Europe&rsquo;s remaining raised bogs.</P>
        <P>This bogland is a priority habitat under the EU habitats directive.  Ireland is obliged under Articles 2 and 4 to protect and, where possible, restore it.  When arrangements were announced for cessation of turf cutting in designated bogs in 1999, a ten-year grace period was granted to domestic turf cutters to allow them to find an alternative source of fuel.  This ten-year period is now coming to an end on 32 designated raised bogs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>A similar ten-year derogation applies to bogs designated after 1999.  When NHAs were designated in 2004, under an agreement with the farming organisations, another ten-year derogation was put in place, allowing cutting in NHAs until 2014.  In the meantime, a review of the state of our bogs has revealed severe and continuing damage by domestic turf cutting.  In the ten years since commercial cutting was ended in designated areas, approximately 35% of the remaining area of this priority EU habitat has been lost.  We are losing a further 2% to 4% of our remaining active raised bog per annum.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">The overall scientific assessment of this habitat is &ldquo;unfavourable, bad&rdquo;, which is the worst of three categories for EU reporting purposes.  It is clear that, at the minimum, such unfavourable <Col N="106"/>habitat status must be addressed by measures to ensure improvement.  In the light of the scientific evidence, it would not be appropriate to extend the ten-year periods for the ending of cutting.</P>
        <P>Since 1999, the Government has actively encouraged the cessation of domestic cutting by buying the traditional turf-cutting rights through a voluntary scheme of compensation.  This covers both SACs and NHAs.  It is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that Ireland meets its obligations with regard to protecting at least a portion of what remains of this valuable element of Irish and European natural heritage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I hope he uses his high office to extend this communiqu&eacute; to his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to whom I have spoken off the record on this matter.</P>
        <P>This is not a new issue.  The secretary general of the INTO, John Carr, who is also a native of Donegal, recently wrote an article on the challenges we are facing with regard to student capacity within the primary school sector in the greater Letterkenny area.   Letterkenny is establishing itself as a gateway town under the gateway status initiative in conjunction with Derry.  If we are to consider our spatial strategy in any comprehensive and methodical way we should critically examine what has happened in Letterkenny in terms of demographics and population growth in recent years.</P>
        <P>While I acknowledge the fact that many schools in Letterkenny, such as Ballyraine national school, benefited from recent infrastructural investment, other schools are still in need of significant investment and extension.  In particular, I mention two schools, St. Colmcille&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; school and Lurgybrack national school.  These schools are coming under increasing pressures and I could list the reasons for this all night.  They include inward migration from other parts of Donegal where people had difficulty obtaining planning permission and were restricted from building in their own rural areas.</P>
        <P>We are looking at an ever-expanding younger generation.  At St. Colmcille&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; school, 63 students have come forward for enrolment this year.  The school faces another year in the unfortunate position of having to turn away students.  It has a history of appeals and a tradition of facilitating as many people as possible.  However, the capacity is not there.</P>
        <P>Letterkenny was the fastest growing town in Europe until recent years.  The greater Letterkenny area has a population of approximately 20,000 and we need infrastructure.  This highlights another part of the challenge we face as a country.  We do not necessarily have an east coast urban problem.  Various parts of the island have the same population pressures as the east coast.  I refer to a research proposal at DIT which suggested that in 20, 40 or 50 years&rsquo; time the balance will be between an urban east coast and a rural west coast.  I can tell the Minister this is not the case.  Donegal, and Letterkenny in particular, is situated 20 miles from Derry, the fourth largest city in Ireland.  Derry city has an urban sprawl and Letterkenny caters for students originally from Derry.  Within the greater Letterkenny area we also have integration and a social mix for which we must cater.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister speak to his colleague?  I know in his reply he will speak about projection appraisals and evaluations of population density.  The schools have provided their own analysis and produced their own projections.  They are there in black and white.  These schools are not in a position to cope with added pressures.  They do not want to turn away students and they want to carry on in the manner they have for generations.</P>
        <P>The Minister is in the Cabinet.  Today, it was stated that capital projects will not be affected by any measures being introduced.  This commitment must be extended to the Department of Education and Science.  I hear there is little money for capital projects.  In the economic circum<Col N="107"/>stances we face we must use imagination and creativity to cater for students being turned away from schools against the wishes of principals and boards of management.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding primary school provision in Letterkenny, County Donegal.  The Department&rsquo;s school building programme in 2008 aims to provide sufficient school places in developing areas, while also showing the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  During the lifetime of the national development plan, approximately &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in school buildings.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.  This investment will facilitate the provision of new schools and extensions in developing areas and the improvement of existing schools through the provision of replacement schools, extensions or large-scale refurbishments in the coming years.  It builds on the delivery of 7,800 building projects under the previous national development plan which resulted in new schools being built and the refurbishment of many existing schools.</P>
        <P>Capital projects under the multi-annual building programme cannot all be delivered together and they are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project, which indicates the urgency, type and extent of work required at a school.  There are four bands overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects include, for example, the provision of buildings where none exist but where there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision of desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities, such as a library or new sports hall.</P>
        <P>The forward planning section of the Department is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards.  This work will be done in consultation with local authorities.  The Department is included among the prescribed authorities to which local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans.  As a matter of course, there is on-going liaison with local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any major proposed developments and their possible implications for school provision.  In addition, the Department planning process utilises census data and school enrolment trends.</P>
        <P>The Department is aware that the latest publication by the Central Statistics Office on population and labour force projections indicates that the population aged five to 12 years is projected to increase by at least 10% in the next decade.  This will happen even with zero net migration and falling fertility rates.  Depending on the extent of inward migration, the increase could be even greater.  Meeting the demand for school places arising from these increases will in be a major challenge for the Department and for the State.  Therefore, when examining accommodation requirements for an area such as Letterkenny, factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  Having considered these factors, decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for attending the Chamber to address this issue.  This is the fourth occasion on which I have sought a reply to this matter.  On the day the story broke, I asked a junior Minister to clarify this issue and I did not receive an adequate response.  When the Minister was in the House last week, I asked about this matter and received no <Col N="108"/>response.  This evening I received a short reply to a parliamentary question I tabled in which the Minister stated, &ldquo;Anecdotal evidence suggests inert slag material was employed for this purpose during the period when the steelworks was in commercial operation but my Department does not hold any records or information from this period&rdquo;.  He further stated that since 2003 &ldquo;no material has been removed from slag heaps to be used in road construction, or indeed any other activity&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This is surprising given that in an article the<i> Irish Examiner</i> on Thursday, 11 August 2005, Eoin English wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">Environmental engineers moved onto the site of the former Irish Steel factory on Haulbowline Island in Cobh, Co. Cork, yesterday to begin the largest industrial clean-up in the history of the State. Consultants working for Cork County Council removed over 80,000 tonnes of hazardous and radioactive materials from the site last year. However, thousands of tonnes of waste material still has to be removed.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Given Ernst &amp; Young, the company engaged by the Minister, was on the site at the time, his response that no material was removed after 2003 is unusual.  It is on record that at least 80,000 tonnes was removed.  People living in the harbour region know mountains of this material were on the island, which are no longer there, and they want to know where they have been moved.</P>
        <P>Between 1998 and 2002, Haulbowline supplied road resurfacing material to two contractors: Road Maintenance Services Limited and Road Binders Limited.  Both companies have registered offices at Unit 1G, Maynooth Business Park, Maynooth, County Kildare.  RMS also has a sub-office in the Mallow area.  They are part of the Colas conglomerate, which has more than 500 companies operating with a budget of &euro;10.7 billion in more than 40 countries.  Those companies were engaged in this and they were operating on NRA contracts.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I have a letter dated 1998 from a D. Daly, chief environment officer of Cork County Council at the time, who states:</P>
        <P LI="1">We are considering how the matter of slag reuse might be progressed ... Slag from iron and steel manufacture is an amber list waste under this regulation which means that approval to movements must be sought from local authorities concerned and the movement must be tracked by the relevant forms.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Was a licence granted to these companies, given a licence must be granted by the local authority?  If so, the Minister can provide traceability about where the material went on road projects to the House.  If no licences were granted, our concern increases.</P>
        <P>There can be no ambiguity by the Minister or his Department about whether this material was moved.  An anecdotal response in a parliamentary question is completely insufficient.  I am asking him for the fourth time to clarify whether material was removed from Haulbowline for road building and to state where are those roads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the revelations by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, we know materials were moved from this site to the mainland.  The current investigation, therefore, must also examine material carried off site.  We need to know where the material was transported to and how it was transported.  Was a licence granted to transport it?  Was only inert material transported?  Is the material forming part of a slag heap somewhere in County Cork?  Given the material was transported by a company based in Mallow, when did it transfer to Mallow?  Is the material still in Mallow or has it been deposited in municipally licensed dumps in north Cork?  Is material deposited in non-licensed facilities?  Can the Minister confirm whether some material has ended up in other locations in north Cork?   Will the Minister, on foot of these revelations, consider a further investigation and use the powers vested in him to seek to ensure <Col N="109"/>complete traceability of all materials?  Will he widen the remit of the current assessment of the site to ensure all traceable material, both on and off site, comes within the remit of that investigation?  In light of these revelations, I also call on the Minister to meet the elected representatives of east Cork and the harbour area and, in particular, the mayor of Cobh immediately to listen to their concerns.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week when we discussed this issue, we were less informed than we are now.  Significant information has been garnered by people interested in this issue, particularly by the two previous speakers.  Local people need to know what will happen with this site and how it will be made safe.  When will the analysis be carried out to find out what is in the material?  The people in the area are very worried for themselves, their children and, above all, the local economy, which will suffer as a result of these revelations.  They need assurances from the Minister who is the only person who can assure them the necessary investigations are being carried out and that we will discover what is in the material, where it was transported to and how and when the site will be dealt with.</P>
        <P>Earlier the Government announced adjustments or curtailments or whatever the Minister wants to call them under which &euro;10 million will be cut from his budget in respect of remediation of landfills.  If what we have found out to date is correct and material removed from this site could have ended up in various landfills, how will this cutback affect his response to this issue?  Will the Haulbowline site not be dealt with as a matter of urgency?  Will it mean when the materials are traced to other landfills, those sites will not be dealt with?  The people in the lower harbour area in Cork want to know what the Minister will do about this and what assurances he can give them that the site will be dealt with speedily and properly?  Above all else, those assurances are vital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  They will be aware that I have already responded to a parliamentary question submitted by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch on this issue today.  This gives me a further opportunity to address the issue, which has become the subject of much media speculation in recent days.</P>
        <P>There has been a long history of industrial activity on Haulbowline Island, which was an important source of employment and a significant part of the local economy.  The steelworks located there became the property of Irish Ispat, which went into liquidation in 2001.  The State, acting through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in a co-ordinating role, took over custody of the site from the liquidator in 2003, as mandated by Government.  The mandate required the Department to co-ordinate all legal actions regarding the site and to address issues such as ongoing site security, maintenance and so on.  It also required the Department to enable a site investigation to be carried out to assist in determining the best option, environmentally and economically, for the future use of the site and its remediation.</P>
        <P>The steelworks operated on Haulbowline Island since 1939 at a time when such industrial activities were poorly regulated.  Inevitably, the nature of the activity generated large quantities of waste, predominately inert slag, which were subsequently deposited on the island in an area that became known as the East Tip.  I take this opportunity to confirm again for the House that, since my Department&rsquo;s involvement with the site began in 2003, no material has been removed from slag heaps to be used in road construction or other such commercial enterprises despite a number of approaches to my Department from interested parties in this regard.  Anecdotal evidence suggests inert slag material was removed from the site and employed for this purpose during the period when the steelworks was in commercial operation and possibly also during the period when the liquidator owned the site.  I can confirm that my Department does not hold any records or information regarding such activities during the periods in question.  I also understand that Cork County Council is investigating the matter in respect of any <Col N="110"/>licences or permits that might have issued for the removal for recycling of any slag material from the site.  I assume that the mountains of material seen by residents and referred to by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch were the so-called heaps of material for export.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, my Department has now engaged consultants to carry out an independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions following the extensive unauthorised works by the subcontractors.  The assessment, which has already begun, is divided into three distinct modules.  White Young Green has had the full benefit of the advice of the EPA, the Marine Institute and the Health and Safety Authority in assessing the quality of surface water, marine sediment and mussel bivalves in the vicinity of Haulbowline Island, in assessing any health or environmental risks that may be posed by the recent works on the East Tip and in monitoring ambient air.  The health and safety assessment will include sampling of slag-fill material across the East Tip.  In 2005, White Young Green carried out an extensive intrusive site investigation that indicated no evidence of any immediate threat to human health or the environment.  It is best suited to determining the best way forward in securing the site from an environmental and health and safety point of view in the short term pending a Government decision on its future use.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kathleen Lynch referred to a so-called cutback or adjustment in respect of landfill remediation, but it will have no implication in terms of the Haulbowline Island situation.  I assure the House that the investigation will continue unaffected.  I have also given a commitment to local residents that a peer review will be carried out of both the 2005 report and the reports expected in the next five weeks from the ongoing White Young Green assessments.  This is in line with best practice.  The residents will be assured that they will be in receipt of the best international methodology.  When I spoke to them, they called for a peer review, which I was happy to allow to proceed.  I have further committed that the results of the ongoing assessment will be published and, as I informed the House last week, I will then advise the Government for purposes of decision making on whatever actions are shown to be necessary, including the question of any studies in regard to human health.  I reassure the local residents and the House that my Department and other relevant agencies are properly engaged in the management of this legacy site in a manner consistent with good practice and the minimisation of risk to human health and the environment.  A coherent overall approach rather than piecemeal action, which could inadvertently cause problems to the local community and the environment, must be taken, which is the objective being pursued by my Department.</P>
        <P>A number of reports have been deposited in the Oireachtas Library.  They are the 1995 and 1998 K. T. Cullen and Company reports, the 2002 O&rsquo;Callaghan Moran report, the 2002 Enviros report and the 2005 White Young Green Report, which is on CD-ROM.  I am committed to releasing any other useful information or reports.  However, that there is considerable misinformation is a problem.  When there is misinformation, fears are stirred up.  I reassure people of my commitment to ensuring that relevant and accurate information is in the public domain to counter such misinformation.</P>

	<P>Joint Policing Committees are provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Because a Committee will be established in each local authority area in the State &mdash; of which there are 114 &mdash; it was considered desirable to run a time-limited pilot to gain experience in their operation before full rollout.  There are now 29 Committees established in the pilot phase, and they operate under guidelines issued in May 2007 by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, following consultation with the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. </P>
        <P>As part of the evaluation of the pilot phase, my predecessor as Minister and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government hosted a consultation seminar last November, at which participants in the pilot Committees considered the lessons from the operation of the Committees to date.  A very useful seminar, organised by Co-operation Ireland, was also held in Monaghan in May, at which participants in the Committees and in the nearest equivalent bodies in Northern Ireland, the District Policing Partnerships, discussed their experiences.</P>
        <P>My Department has prepared amended guidelines which take on board the experience gained in the pilot phase and allow for the establishment of Committees in all local authority areas in the State.  This work was carried out in consultation with the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, <Col N="112"/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives of local authority members and management.  As provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, I am currently formally consulting with my two Ministerial colleagues, and I expect to have their response in the very near future.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of their response, I intend to issue the guidelines, which will enable Committees to be established in each local authority area in the State, at an early date.  In particular, my aim is to begin the roll out to other areas prior to the Summer break and have Joint Policing Committees in place in all local authority areas this year.  I believe the Committees are already making a major contribution to the further improvement of the policing of their areas, by building up a partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the local authority, Oireachtas members and the community and voluntary sector and will continue to do so.</P>

	<P>The civilianisation programme proposed for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is being implemented by the Garda Commissioner and significant progress has been made to date in the recruitment of civilian staff.  The total number of full and part-time civilian staff assigned to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at the 30th June 2008 has increased to 2,549 from 2,267 on 10th December 2007. This represents just over 14% of organisational workforce.</P>
        <P>Civilian staff are involved in the provision of a wide range of important support services in the administrative, professional, technical and industrial areas.  This is best demonstrated by the range of recruitment of civilians that has taken place in the Garda organisation as follows:&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />Over 300 Clerical Officers have been recruited and assigned positions within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Dublin in 2007 on foot of a Government Decision of 19 December 2006. These Clerical Officers have been allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Region, Garda Headquarters and various Specialised Units.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />The civilianisation of posts at senior levels of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also commenced.  Appointments have been made to the positions of Chief Administration Officer and Director of ICT.  Competitions to recruit the Director of Change Management and Head of Legal Services are at an advanced stage, while recruitment for the positions of Executive Director of Human Resources and Executive Director of Finance will commence as soon as possible.  A significant number of other senior and middle management civilian posts have also been created in areas such as HR, Finance, Procurement, IT, Housing, Transport, Crime &amp; Policing Analysis and Internal Audit.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />As well as the expansion of the senior civilian management cadre, approximately 150 new management and supervisory positions have been created throughout the country at Higher Executive Officer, Executive Officer and Staff Officer levels.  As well as enhancing the capacity of the organisation to manage its rapidly increasing civilian complement &mdash; and allowing sworn members to concentrate on operational duties &mdash; this has provided a career structure for Garda civilian staff which did not exist before.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />A number of vacancies in other technical areas such as cartography, telecommunications, accountancy, photography have also been filled in the recent past.</P><Col N="113"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />Significant progress is underway in recruiting 300 Clerical Officers to Garda stations outside Dublin, the Garda Central Vetting Unit, Thurles and the Garda Information Services Centre, Castlebar.  There has been a net increase (after promotions, transfers etc) of 212 Clerical Officers in areas outside the DMR between May 2007 and 30 June 2008.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P FLI="0">I have been informed by the Commissioner that he has established a group to review the potential for further civilianisation and to develop an integrated strategy for future civilianisation in the Garda organisation.  This group is due to submit a final report to the Commissioner by the end of September 2008.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to developing the civilian support and management function within the Organisation to a level commensurate with best international practice and will continue to work to drive the civilianisation programme forward.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the reason it takes two and a half years, on average, to process an application for naturalisation; and if will introduce an improved system in view of the fact that there are currently 20,000 such applications on the waiting list. </Quest>
        <QRef>[26971/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The existing processing time for applications for certificates of naturalisation is approximately thirty months and this is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years.  In 2002 there were 3,500 applications for certificates of naturalisation whereas in 2007, the number of such applications exceeded 8,000, representing a very significant increase. This upward trend seems set to continue and it is anticipated that applications for naturalisation will increase to 10,000 in the present year.</P>
        <P>I think it would be useful for me to set out for the Deputy the procedures employed to assess applications for naturalisation.  Upon receipt, an initial examination of each application is carried out to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for amendment. Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act. Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.  Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, over 3,500 applicants who applied since that date have been found to be ineligible.  All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency, within a matter of weeks from the date the application is received, and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.</P>
        <P>Further processing takes place at a later stage and involves assessing an applicant&rsquo;s financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State.  Enquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time enquiries are also made with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to clarify if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  Depending on the complexity of any given case, these processes can take a lengthy time to complete.  Once all enquiries are completed, the file is referred to me for a decision.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the granting of Irish Citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. The procedures involved in the processing of applications have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary <Col N="114"/>to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process. Consequently, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved.</P>
        <P>The recent decentralisation of the Citizenship Section to Tipperary Town has resulted in a substantial redeployment in the staffing resources available to the section.  This is expected to have a positive impact on the number of  naturalisation applications on hand and will in time see a significant reduction in processing time scales.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement setting out details of the number of recorded incidents involving a firearm in each of the five years to date; the number of proceedings commenced; and the number leading to convictions.  Figures provided for 2008 are provisional, operational and liable to change.  The details have been compiled by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
        <P>I also set out a tabular statement setting out details of the number of proceedings commenced and convictions for offences of harming, threatening to harm, menacing, intimidating and putting in fear of another person who (a) was assisting in the investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of an offence or (b) is a witness/potential witness/juror/potential juror in proceedings for an <Col N="115"/>offence with the intention of causing the investigation/course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.  The details have been compiled by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the detection rate for crimes by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that in respect of each year the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and the number of proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts. This applies particularly to crimes committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than those referred to.  Furthermore such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than those referred to.</P>
        <P>There can be considerable difficulties for the Garda&iacute; in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities. This arises not least because generally none of the associates of such victims will co-operate with the Garda investigation.  Nevertheless, the Garda&iacute; are determined to pursue rigorously those involved in gun crime.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rigorously enforces the provisions relating to witness intimidation and protection contained in the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  In particular, where the possibility of intimidation of witnesses may be an issue, the case is closely monitored throughout the investigation, up to and including any criminal proceedings.  In circumstances where the senior investigation officer in a case has identified a witness who is crucial to the case and the evidence to be preferred is not available elsewhere, and there is a serious threat to the life of the witness or his/her family, an application can be made, with the consent of the witness, to have him/her included in the Witness Security Programme.</P></Speaker>

	<P>Negotiations are currently underway with a commercial consortium, which was selected following an E.U. tender procedure as the preferred tender for the design, construction, finance and maintenance of the proposed prison facilities at Thornton Hall, North County Dublin.  The project includes the construction of the prison facilities along with the ancillary infrastructure including services.</P>
        <P>The development consent process for the new prison which is set out in Part 4 of the Prisons Act was recently completed in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>It is intended, subject to the successful conclusion of the contract negotiations, to commence construction later this year.  It is envisaged that the development will take approximately three years to complete.</P>
        <P>It is not appropriate, for commercial and procurement reasons, to provide details as to the likely costs of the construction and fit out costs.  In particular it would not be in the public interest to give an indication of expected costs before a bid is accepted and a contract finalised.  The disclosure of such information is, in any event, not allowed under Department of Finance guidelines applicable to Public Private Partnership.</P>
        <P>I can, however, confirm the following expenditure which has taken place to date on the project.  The cost of the site acquisition was &euro;29,900,000.  An additional 8.7 acres has also been acquired to provide a dedicated access road to the main site.   This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern in relation to the effect of increased traffic generated by the prison project.  In addition to allaying these concerns, the new roadway will provide significant additional benefits both during the construction and operational phases of the project.  The cost of this additional land was &euro;1,305,000.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;6,148,053.00 has been expended to date on preliminary site works including surveys, landscaping, security and maintenance of the property, studies such as archaeological, topographical, etc., and professional fees including legal and specialist technical advice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Priority Question No. 52 of today.</P>
        <P>I condemn the activities of those involved in organised crime who carry out attacks on others with whom they regard themselves as being in dispute and who do not hesitate to use lethal weapons in doing so.  In particular, I condemn attacks on people who appear to have been targeted for no other reason other than that they are relatives of certain individuals.</P><Col N="117"/>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, of course, shares my grave concern at these activities.  The Force is devoting significant resources to preventing such serious incidents occurring and, where necessary, is being aided by the expertise of the Army in doing so.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na meets this task by strategic actions, including in particular continuous and intensive intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in such illegal activity.  Available intelligence is fully analysed and used in the strategic deployment of both local and specialised operational Garda units in targeting persons and groups.  It is used in carrying out searches and arrests aimed at preventing attacks.  The searches contribute to intelligence gathering, and the arrests apprehend persons suspected of being involved in such attacks.  Profiles regarding the personnel of organised criminal gangs are continually updated.</P>
        <P>Both uniformed and plain-clothes Garda patrols and checkpoints have been increased in areas where it is considered likely such attacks might take place.  In recent months, action has been focused on particular individuals.  Search operations have taken place with the aim of identifying the sources of devices, such as pipe bombs, being used.  A quantity of such devices has been seized, and a number of persons have been arrested and charged.  These persons are currently before the courts.  Firearms and drugs have also been recovered, resulting in the arrest and charging of persons suspected of having significant involvement in such criminality.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has established, on a permanent basis, the Organised Crime Unit, with the specific objective of targeting those suspected of involvement in organised crime, including drug trafficking, importation, sale and supply.  Similar operations are undertaken by Garda specialist units, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in May, 2005 to deal with this type of serious crime and was extended nationwide in 2006.  The primary focus of the Operation is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt, visible patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, Mr Justice Morris has produced six excellent and comprehensive reports to date all of which have been published. His seventh and eighth reports are currently awaited by me.</P>
        <P>On 1 April 2008 he  wrote to my predecessor indicating that he would be in a position to submit those last remaining reports in mid June. However on 13 June he contacted the Secretary General of my Department stating that there would be a delay and that he was not now in a position to present his final two reports until September. He confirmed that in writing on the same day.</P>
        <P>Under the instrument establishing the Tribunal I must, save in one exceptional circumstance, arrange to have the reports laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 14 days of receipt.  That exceptional circumstance relates to a situation where on receipt of a report I consider that its publication within that timeframe might prejudice any criminal proceedings. In such a case I must apply to the High Court for directions.  My predecessors have only had to resort to <Col N="118"/>this procedure once since the Tribunal was established and I am not anticipating that it will arise in the case of the two outstanding reports.</P>

        <Quest> the advice he has received or requested from the Children Acts Advisory Board since its establishment in July 2007; the role he has in the development and progression of the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008 to 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The functions of the Children Acts Advisory Board (CAAB), which was established by the Minister for Health and Children, are set out in Section 227(1) of the Children Act 2001, as amended by the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007.   The Board may, at the request of the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform, advise on policy issues relating to the co-ordinated delivery of services under the Children Act 2001 and the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, including residential accommodation and support services to children at risk.</P>
        <P>Within the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform, services under the Children Act are dealt with by the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS), an executive office, which is responsible for leading and driving reform of the youth justice system.  While the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform has neither received nor requested specific advice from the CAAB, I can say that the IYJS operates in strategic partnership with all of the relevant stakeholders including the criminal justice agencies and services in the health, education and welfare systems and with the community and voluntary sectors to ensure a co-ordinated approach in meeting the needs of children who come into conflict with the law.  The Children Acts Advisory Board is also one of the key stakeholders involved and works in close co-operation with the IYJS to bring about greater inter-agency co-operation in the delivery of services to children.</P>
        <P>The justice sector is represented on the CAAB by three nominees of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the National Director of the IYJS, the Director of the Probation Service and an Inspector from the Garda National Juvenile Office.  In addition, IYJS officials are represented on a number of CAAB inter-agency committees and working groups, including those on research and therapeutic intervention in residential centres.  The IYJS and the other key bodies involved in the youth justice sector participate and present information in the various seminars and other events held throughout the country by the CAAB.  The CAAB is also represented on the National Youth Justice Oversight Group which is monitoring the implementation of the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010, to which it contributed.</P>
        <P>In so far as to the role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to the National Youth Justice Strategy, the executive agency responsible for the strategy within his Department, the Irish Youth Justice Service, developed the strategy in partnership with Government Departments and Agencies who have a role to play in delivering services to, or an interest in, children who are in conflict with the law, e.g. the Department of Education and Science, the Health Service Executive, children&rsquo;s charities, the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
        <P>The Strategy of course acknowledges that the youth justice system is but one component in a broader community-based approach for preventing youth offending that takes account of the wider family and societal issues which need to be addressed by a number of agencies.  Both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and myself are confident that the National Youth Justice Strategy will make a difference in helping to reduce offending and lead to better outcomes for all concerned.</P><Col N="119"/>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has delegated responsibility for youth justice matters under the Children Act  to me, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</P>

	<P>The website launch follows the publication last year of an OECD Report on Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of the Convention on Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and represents a cross-departmental, multi-agency approach to raising awareness and ensuring that the public is fully informed of how they should report any suspicion of such corrupt practices.  It is intended to highlight the serious consequences such practices have for companies operating in an international business environment.  In addition to companies engaged in international trade promotion and financial transactions, such offences of bribery and corruption can have implications for individuals, agencies with international connections and those working in the area of development aid.  </P>
        <P>The most important function of the website is to act as a central repository for information on Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations in the fight against bribery and corruption by providing information on Conventions and Treaties to which this country is a party.  It is my intention that this website should be developed over time and that new up-to-date information is added to it, as appropriate.  I am anxious to ensure that when Ireland is evaluated by International Organisations such as the OECD or the Council of Europe to see how it complies with the relevant international treaties and conventions, the Government can demonstrate openly and transparently that it takes its obligations very seriously, not least by publishing these evaluations on the new website.</P>

	<P>A central element of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Sampling and Evidence) Bill will be the establishment of a DNA database for the purposes of criminal investigations and the identification of missing or unknown deceased persons or seriously injured persons.  The Bill will provide an updated statutory framework for the taking and use of forensic samples and will repeal the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990. It  will draw on the recommendations of the Report of the Law Reform Commission concerning the establishment of a DNA Database. </P>
        <P>Drafting of the Bill is progressing well and I expect to be in a position to publish it in the Autumn. The Deputy will appreciate that a Bill of this nature requires careful drafting, to ensure, on the one hand, that it contains adequate safeguards for the rights of those from whom forensic material is to be taken while at the same time providing a practical framework that maximises the potential benefits of such a database from the operational and technical perspectives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Forensic Science Laboratory and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

        <Quest> the reason Ireland, according to a letter written by an Estonian judge, has no appointed authority in a position to offer an opinion to courts in other jurisdictions pursuant to Article 13 of the Hague Convention of 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction; and if he will take steps to address this important shortfall. </Quest>

	<P>Article 13 of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction sets out criteria whereby a court before whom an application for the return of a child to its country of habitual residence might refuse to order that return. Where a party to such proceedings asserts that those criteria or any of them exist in any particular case, it is a matter to be determined by the court dealing with that application, having regard to the circumstances of the case before it. </P>
        <P>The Department does not comment on individual cases. However, I can indicate the following by way of general information. The correspondence to which the Deputy refers in his Question relates to a particular case in connection with which the Estonian central authority conveyed to the Irish central authority a query of a general and hypothetical nature regarding the possibilities in Ireland if a finding in accordance with Article 13 of the Hague Convention were to be made by the Estonian Court in that case. The Irish authorities are not in a position to respond to such a general question in the absence of specific allegations on which such a finding might be based and, if such allegations are made or such a finding is made, what steps the applicant for the return of the child might be disposed to take, whether alone, in concert with the Health Service Executive as the authority responsible for safeguarding children at risk, or by means of proceedings in the Irish courts, in order to satisfy the Estonian court that the return of the child to Ireland would not, or would no longer, be a grave risk to the child. The Estonian central authority has been informed accordingly.</P>
        <P>The Irish central authority holds itself ready to deal with any specific queries from the Estonian authorities or from the applicant in this case.</P>

        <Quest> the reason those provisions of the Children Act 2001, which were designed to help combat juvenile crime by ensuring that parents took responsibility for children involved in acts of crime and vandalism, have never been used in the seven years since the Act was passed, specifically sections 91, 111, 113 and 114; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Children Act 2001, as amended, provides for a number of measures in relation to parental responsibility in respect of children involved in anti-social behaviour, and children found guilty of offences.</P>
        <P>Section 91 of the Act provides that the parents or guardian of a child shall, be required to attend at all stages of any proceedings against the child for an offence, including family conference and failure to comply with a community sanction or any condition to which the sanction is subject.</P>
        <P>Section 111 of the Act provides that in any proceedings in which a child is found guilty of an offence, the court may make an order for the supervision of the child&rsquo;s parents where it is satisfied that a wilful failure of the child&rsquo;s parents to take care of or control the child contributed to the child&rsquo;s criminal behaviour. This Section came into effect in July 2007 with necessary changes in the District Court Rules.</P><Col N="121"/>
        <P>Section 113 of the Act provides that where a court is satisfied of the guilt of a child and that the appropriate way of dealing with the case is to make a compensation order, it may order that the compensation be paid by the parent or guardian of the child instead of the child.</P>
        <P>Section 114 of the Act provides that a parent or guardian may be ordered by the court to enter into a recognisance to exercise proper and adequate control over their child.  If the child is found guilty of another offence as a result of said parent or guardian failing to exercise such control, the parent or guardian would forfeit the recognisance.</P>
        <P>It should be noted, however, that the imposition of any particular sanction referred to above on the parents or guardians of an offending child is a matter for the judiciary.  The Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  It is therefore not open to the Minister to comment in any way in relation to how cases are conducted or outcomes arrived at.  These are matters entirely for the presiding Judge and it would be inappropriate for the Minister to comment or intervene in such matters.</P>
        <P>There are other interventions available under the Children Act 2001 which involve the parents of children who come into conflict with the criminal justice system. In this regard, I wish to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to my answer to Question No. 132 (ref 27168/08)  on restorative justice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of murders involving knives or sharp instruments increased from 23 in 2006 to 37 in 2007. This increase is a matter of concern.  I am also informed that for the first six months of this year four murder offences involving a knife or sharp instrument have been recorded. </P>
        <P>I am further informed that 721 proceedings were taken in 2006 for offences under sections 9(1), 9(4) and 10(1) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990, and 554 proceedings taken in 2007.  These offences relate to possession or trespassing with a knife or weapon of offence.  It should be noted that some time can elapse between an offence and when proceedings in respect of it are taken.</P>
        <P>Our legislation already prescribes very strong penalties for offences involving the use of knives and similar weapons. The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 and the Offensive Weapons Order 1991, which contain the criminal law in this area, lay down strict prohibitions on such weapons and severe penalties for breaking those prohibitions. Indeed, our law generally provides for very heavy penalties for offences involving weapons. A person found guilty of murder through stabbing or otherwise is of course liable to the highest possible penalty of a mandatory life sentence.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, my predecessor as Minister asked the Garda Commissioner to review the law in this area to see whether further measures should be taken. The Commissioner has recently finalised his review, and my Department is currently examining it. If necessary, we will strengthen our law even further. In considering this matter, we have to be conscious that it would not be practical to ban or restrict many of the knives and similar weapons which are often used in attacks, as they have legitimate uses in home and workplaces. What we have to target instead is their possession in inappropriate circumstances.</P>
        <P>The Garda Policing Plan for 2008, which reflects the priorities set for the Force by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, contains a series of measures to target the use of knives and similar offensive weapons for violent attacks. As well as taking rigorous action under the criminal law against those found carrying such weapons, the Garda&iacute; will be launching later this year a public awareness campaign addressing this behaviour.</P>
        <P>The use of knives and other weapons can arise in the context of incidents of public disorder and excessive consumption of alcohol. To address this, I introduced the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which is currently being considered by the House. The Bill contains a number of important reforms of the licensing laws and public order legislation, with the aim of addressing the adverse consequences of alcohol abuse in our society.  The measures being proposed are a balanced response to problems caused by excessive alcohol consumption and binge drinking.</P>
        <P>The Garda Policing Plan for 2008 includes actions to proactively target groups and individuals involved in anti-social behaviour and identify hot-spots where such behaviour is taking place.</P>
        <P>Policing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of communities is a key factor in addressing this type of behaviour. Significant progress is being made to increase the strength of the Force. As of May <Col N="123"/>2008 there were 13,874 fully attested members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Furthermore, hundreds of extra civilian staff have been recruited to free up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.</P>

        <P>It is of course the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I agree with the view of the Garda Inspectorate, expressed in its most recent report, that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The report of the working group developing proposals for a comprehensive model of rural and urban community policing is now at the final draft stage and will be submitted to the Commissioner for approval shortly.  I look forward to receiving a copy of the final Report from the Commissioner in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account. The situation will be kept under review and when additional <Col N="124"/>personnel next become available the allocation of Community Garda&iacute; will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I have no proposals to make any changes to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission. However, discussions have been taking place between the Commission and my Department for some time regarding certain amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 proposed by the Commission. This is against the background of the Report made by the Commission pursuant to section 80(2) in the Act and the changes which, in the light of its experience to date, the Commission believe will contribute to its greater effectiveness in the use of its resources and operational efficiency.</P>
        <P>Details of the amendments are set out in the recently published Report under that section by the Commission which it launched on 1 May, 2008 in conjunction with its second Annual Report. Two of the most significant changes concern the Commission&rsquo;s power to conduct preliminary enquiries and the power to exercise greater discretion about what constitutes an appropriate and proportional investigation into a complaint.  Both Reports have been laid before each house of the Oireachtas in accordance with section 80(6) of the Act.  I hope to obtain Government approval shortly for the drafting of Bill amending the 2005 Act.</P>

	<P>Sentencing policy, including mandatory sentencing, is a matter which is kept under review within my Department. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down the maximum penalty appropriate to an offence generally and for the courts, having considered all the circumstances of the offence in each particular case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum. This approach reflects the doctrine of the separation of powers. The law enables the Judge to exercise his or her discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he or she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and, assessing the culpability and circumstances of the accused. There are a small number of situations, however, where the Legislature has intervened by statute to create exceptions to this approach through mandatory sentencing for certain crimes.</P>
        <P>Firstly, mandatory life sentences apply to the most serious of offences including murder, treason and the offence of genocide in cases where the offence involves the killing of any person.</P>
        <P>Secondly, mandatory minimum sentences apply where a person is convicted of a second or subsequent offence under section 15A or 15B of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 as amended.  These are the offences of possession or importation of controlled drugs for sale or supply with a value of over of &euro;13,000.  Mandatory minimum sentences also apply to certain firearms offences.</P>
        <P>Finally, presumptive minimum sentences apply where:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />a person is convicted of a first offence under section 15A or 15B of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 as amended;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />a person is convicted on indictment of a second or subsequent offence being a scheduled offence under section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 within a period of 7 years of a previous conviction on indictment for a scheduled offence. In order for the provision to be triggered, the sentence imposed for the previous conviction must have been 5 years or more. The scheduled offences include serious non-fatal offences against the person, aggravated burglary, firearms and explosives offences, drug trafficking offences, and organised crime offences.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Presumptive minimum sentences also apply to certain firearms offences.</P><Col N="126"/>
        <P>Unlike mandatory or mandatory minimum sentences, presumptive minimum sentences allow a judge, who is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist, to depart from the mandatory or mandatory minimum sentence specified in statute and impose a lesser sentence.</P>
        <P>There are a number of commitments relating to sentencing contained in the Programme for Government including a commitment to establish a Judicial Sentencing Commission to formulate sentencing guidelines. The Programme for Government also provides for a formal annual review of the stringent new mandatory sentencing regime for drug crime introduced in section 33 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007. As those provisions were commenced with effect from 18 May 2007, they are now in operation for just over a year. The issue of establishing a formal review mechanism will be addressed at the appropriate stage.</P>
        <P>In considering the matter of sentencing, my Department is guided by the ongoing work of the Steering Committee established by the Courts Service Board to plan for and provide information on sentencing.  The committee, under the chairmanship of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court, comprises a judge from the High, Circuit and District Courts and a university law lecturer with expertise in sentencing law.</P>
        <P>The project, known as the Irish Sentencing Information System (&ldquo;ISIS&rdquo;), involves an examination of the feasibility of providing a computerised information system on sentences and other penalties imposed for criminal offences.  This will assist judges when considering the sentence to be imposed in an individual case.  The objective of a sentencing information system is to enable a judge, by entering relevant criteria, to access information about the range of sentences and other penalties imposed for particular types of offence in previous cases.  The Committee established a pilot project in June 2006 in Dublin Circuit Criminal Court. A further pilot commenced in Cork Circuit Court in April of this year.  An appropriate IT system has been developed incorporating a database where the information collected is electronically stored for subsequent retrieval and searching.  The work of the Steering Committee is ongoing.</P>

	<P>The National Disability Strategy was launched by Government in September, 2004 and underpins the participation of people with disabilities in Irish society by building on existing policy and legislation.  The implementation of the Strategy is the agreed focus of disability policy under the Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016.  My Department is responsible for the provision of the framework for the implementation of the Strategy including cross-Departmental co-ordination and reports to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion on progress of the Strategy.  </P>
        <P>Under the terms of Towards 2016, the National Disability Strategy Stakeholder Monitoring Group was established in November, 2006 to monitor progress on the overall implementation of the Strategy.  The Group comprises representatives of stakeholder groups, trade unions, senior officials and the National Disability Authority (NDA) while my Department also serves as Secretariat to the Group.</P>
        <P>Key elements of the National Disability Strategy include the Disability Act 2005 and Sectoral Plans for service provision for people with disabilities.  The Disability Act is the cornerstone of the National Disability Strategy and my Department played a lead role in its development and enactment.</P><Col N="127"/>
        <P>The accessibility provisions of the Disability Act are supported by the Code of Practice  on Accessibility of Public Services and Information provided by public bodies which was published in July 2006.  The Code of Practice was developed by the NDA in consultation with my Department.  The Act also gives statutory effect to the 3% employment target for people with disabilities in the public sector.  My Department has a key role in relation to the implementation of these provisions while progress achieved by public bodies in this regard is being monitored by the NDA.  Again, under the Act, a Centre for Excellence in Universal Design has been established within the NDA with the support of my Department.  The Centre has an important role in contributing to the development and promotion of standards in universal design.</P>
        <P>The NDA is concerned with the implementation of important aspects of the Strategy and works closely with my Department to meet relevant objectives.</P>
        <P>My Department had a central role in relation to the negotiation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which was adopted by a UN General Assembly in December 2006.   Ireland was in the first group of countries to sign the Convention.  My Department continues to have a central role in relation to the Convention&rsquo;s ratification process.  My Department also had a central role in the development of the Council of Europe Disability Action Plan, 2006 &mdash; 2015.</P>
        <P>My Department also funds certain accessible transport initiatives for people with disabilities, provided &euro;6 million for an independent living support programme and provides financial support to People with Disabilities in Ireland (PwDI).  My Department also continues to fund the Enhancing Disabilities Services Programme which was launched in 2005.  The Programme comprises a funding package of &euro;15 million over the five-year period 2005 &mdash; 2009 to support once-off projects which can demonstrate an innovative, efficient, collaborative and cost effective approach to service provision for people with disabilities.  The budgetary allocation for this project is &euro;3 million per year.</P>
        <P>In 2007, my Department undertook a number of awareness raising initiatives, including funding two TV programmes and a National Information Day.  The cost for these projects was &euro;341,000 in 2007.  My Department is continuing these projects in 2008 and the budgetary allocation for the year is in the region of &euro;423,000.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 89 together.</P>
        <P>Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007. Part 13 of the Act, relating to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children. With regard to children these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children&rsquo;s Court.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am informed by the Garda authorities that from 1 January, 2007 to 31 May, 2008, 700 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 354 to children. There have been ten formal good behaviour contracts agreed.</P>
        <P>In setting up the regime in the Criminal Justice Act 2006, the intention was that these warnings or good behaviour contracts would themselves address the problem behaviour. It is only if they fail that a court order will be applied for. In any case, it inevitably takes time to reach the stage where a court order itself might be sought. No significance therefore should be attached to the fact that the stage has not yet been reached in the process where a court order has been issued. Where warnings or good behaviour contracts do not succeed in altering a person&rsquo;s behaviour, they will culminate in an order being sought by the Garda authorities from the courts.</P>

	<P>Part 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 amended the law governing the circumstances in which inferences could be drawn in criminal proceedings from a failure or refusal by the accused to account for certain suspicious circumstances which clearly call for an explanation when requested to do so by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na either prior to or when being charged. </P>
        <P>Part 4 also extended the range of offences in respect of which inferences could be drawn from a failure by a person to mention particular facts which he/she later relied on in his or her defence when being questioned by a member of the Garda&iacute; either prior to or when being charged. These provisions now apply in respect of all arrestable offences &mdash; the limited provisions of section 5 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 were repealed.</P>
        <P>The operation of these inference-drawing provisions is governed by a number of important safeguards. In particular the provisions cannot be applied unless;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />The accused was told in ordinary language (i.e. cautioned) what effect the failure of refusal might have;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />The accused was afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult a solicitor before the failure or refusal occurred;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />The Garda questioning was recorded by electronic means or the accused consented in writing to it not being so.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Furthermore a person may not be convicted of an offence solely or mainly on an inference drawn from a failure or refusal to account for suspicious circumstances or to mention particular facts i.e. corroboration is required.</P>
        <P>Part 4 also provides that the Minister may make regulations that would include details on the form of caution or cautions to be used by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as the withdrawal and replacement of cautions.  This matter is currently being considered by officials of my Department.</P>

	<P>Operation Trace was established in October, 1998. The original objectives of the investigation team under this dedicated initiative were to trace, review and collate all evidence pertaining to the separate Garda investigations into the disappearance of six women in the Leinster area. Subsequently the investigations into the disappearance of four other missing women were also reviewed.</P>
        <P>Information and intelligence relative to the Operation continues to be collated and assimilated on a dedicated stand-alone database maintained for the purpose of the Operation. A Detective Superintendent retains operational responsibility to ensure that all such information and queries received are identified, catalogued and acted upon. The Detective Superintendent <Col N="130"/>also ensures that liaison is maintained with the families of these missing women, to ensure that they are kept apprised of any progress or developments arising from information received or lines of enquiry being pursued.</P>
        <P>Operation Trace will continue its role of collating, reviewing and examining all evidence based on enquiries and investigations conducted under the direction of the respective District Officers.</P>
        <P>I am confident that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has devoted significant resources, time and investigative skills to investigate these disappearances. The cases have been subject to numerous reviews to ensure that the Garda&iacute; maximise any new investigative opportunities and that they employ the most up to date techniques and methods in line with best international practice.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 97 together.</P>
        <P>The enabling provisions to allow for the use of Electronic Monitoring are provided for in the Criminal Justice Acts of 2006 and 2007.  However, before any decisions are taken on the introduction of those specific provisions careful and detailed consideration must be given to the costs, advances in technology, the offender cohort most suitable and the likely overall impact on reducing recidivism and preventing crime. For those reasons I have no immediate plans at this point in time to implement the enabling provisions of the Criminal Justice Acts, 2006 and 2007, in relation to Electronic Monitoring.</P>
        <P>Whilst my Department is keeping developments in other jurisdictions under review, I would advise Deputies that the experience abroad indicates that there are technical, operational and cost limitations.  For example, there have been instances where people have committed serious crimes while subject to electronic monitoring.  As I have already said, in previous debates in the House, I would have reservations about its application in bail cases.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, there are a range of community based sanctions available to assist in the management of offenders and it is important that we look at the merits and cost effectiveness of the full range of options before coming to any final judgment on Electronic Monitoring.</P>

	<P>In December 2005, following publication of the Youth Justice Review, the Government agreed a programme to implement youth justice reforms.  These reforms included the establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children; the establishment of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) as an executive office of my Department; and a number of legislative amendments to the Children Act 2001.  These were aimed at changing the way in which responsibility for youth justice matters was previously spread across a number of Departments.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say that the recommendations of the Youth Justice Review have been implemented.  Responsibility for youth justice matters is now co-ordinated and focused by a single body, the IYJS, which works in partnership with the criminal justice agencies, the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) and other statutory and non-statutory bodies.   The commencement of all provisions of the Children Act, 2001, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 has also been completed.  In addition, progress is being made on the ongoing redevelopment of children detention facilities and the implementation of the recently published National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010.  I am confident the implementation of these reforms will make a difference in helping to reduce offending and improve outcomes for both young people and the public in general.</P>

	<P>Every effort is being made to have the Property Services Regulatory Authority Bill published as soon as possible.  Publication is subject to the resolution of certain legal issues that have arisen during completion of the drafting process.</P>
        <P>As regards the regulation of management companies, I should point out that the recently-published Law Reform Commission Report on Multi-Unit Developments does not recommend any such regulatory role for the National Property Services Regulatory Authority.</P><Col N="132"/>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a wide-ranging document which recommends reforms across a broad range of policy areas including planning and development law, tax law, company law, the law relating to registration of ownership of land, the jurisdiction of the courts and other related areas.  As I have already indicated in response to Parliamentary Questions, a high level interdepartmental committee on multi-unit developments has been established to identify the legislative and administrative actions that should be taken in response to recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission on the matter.  The Committee has already had its first meeting to consider the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations &mdash; 70 in total &mdash; that are contained in its Report.</P>
        <P>My Department is already engaging with the Property Registration Authority to examine the recommendations made, for example, in relation to the registration of title for multi-unit developments.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is examining the recommendations for the strengthening of company law.  In so far as issues relating to consumer information and general awareness in the area of multi-unit developments are concerned the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has already welcomed the new publication launched by the National Consumer Agency to address the need for consumers to understand the issues around multi-unit developments.  This followed on from the work at the stakeholder forum on which his Department and other key organisations were represented.</P>
        <P>I should also mention that the National Consumer Agency has agreed a Code of Practice for developers of multi-unit developments with the Irish Home Builders Association. This Code outlines the responsibilities of developers regarding ownership, management and maintenance of common areas and the provision of common services within such developments.  It also addresses areas such as the establishment and operation of the management company, the use of property management agents, the calculation of service charges and establishment of a sinking fund.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 112 and 114 together.</P>
        <P>At 30th June 2008, there were 258 attested Reserve Garda&iacute; and 93 Reserve trainees.  The 258 attested members currently operational are assigned to the following stations:</P><Col N="133"/>

        <P FLI="0">The Agreed Programme for Government has set a target strength for the Reserve at 10% of the full-time strength of the force. In the Annual Policing Plan for 2008 the Garda Commissioner has set a target of recruiting 270 Reserve members this year.  As the Garda Reserve depends on volunteers who undertake their training and other duties during their free time, it is difficult to predict how many people will commence training in any particular period.  However I can assure the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner is making every effort to reach the recruitment target.</P>
        <P>Recruitment is continuing and regular promotional efforts to attract potential Reserve members are being undertaken.  In February and March 2007, the Garda Commissioner appointed a Chief Superintendent and Superintendent to co-ordinate the management and promotion of the Garda Reserve.</P>
        <P>There is an on-going marketing campaign to recruit members to the Garda Reserve.  This is achieved through local media interviews, radio advertisements, cinema advertisements, and public transport advertisements.  Also, stands were taken at the Ploughing Championships, the Young Scientist of the Year Awards and F&Aacute;S Opportunities in Croke Park.  The Garda Reserve featured on the RTE Crime Call programme and a promotional DVD was commissioned and forwarded to all second level schools in the country.  This DVD was transmitted on the City Channel for three months.  Promotional material on the Garda Reserve has been forwarded to each District Officer in the country to be disseminated to post offices, libraries, leisure centres, shopping centres, banks and credit unions in their District, as well as to local residents associations, neighbourhood watch groups and community alert groups.</P>
        <P>The mission of the Garda Reserve is to provide an efficient response and a quality service at all times and to enhance partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the local community.</P>
        <P>Under section 15 (5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the range of powers and duties of Reserve Garda&iacute; is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to determine. The Garda Commissioner has initially determined that the duties of a Reserve member shall include the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />Station Duty, other than the care and custody of prisoners;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />Assistant to the Station Orderly;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />Road Traffic checkpoint duties, accompanied by a full time member;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />Duty at the outer cordon of major events such as festivals and major sporting   events;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />Assisting in the event of accidents, fires and major emergencies;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />Giving evidence in Court;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />Community/Neighbourhood Policing;</P>
        <P FLI="0">Members of the Garda Reserve carry out most or all of the above duties. In addition, are predominantly engaged in foot patrol and duties at major events, such as sporting events and festivals. A small number are involved in Community / Neighbourhood policing. Some members of the Garda Reserve have assisted with the marketing of the Garda Reserve at a local level by attending promotional events.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As part of a general review of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act last year, the extension of the Act to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was considered.  That consideration involved an examination of all factors relevant to the governance, oversight and accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </P>
        <P>Since the passage of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the regulatory and administrative landscape in which it operates has been undergoing massive change.  The Garda Ombudsman Commission has been established. The Garda Inspectorate has been established and has produced three reports with major implications for the structure and operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the past year the senior civilian management positions of Chief Administrative Officer and Director of Communications have been created.  Further civilians are currently being recruited for key posts as Legal Advisor, Director of Information and Communications Technology and Director of Change Management.  At the same time the ranks of attested members and the numbers of civilian staff have been expanding.</P>
        <P>In light of this extensive and fast-moving change it was decided that to extend the FOI Act to the Garda&iacute; at this time would place an excessive administrative burden on the resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as the Force continues to discharge its challenging core duties, in particular that of tackling crime.  For all these reasons it was decided not to extend the FOI Act to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at this time, but to keep the matter under review. In this regard, I intend to be guided by the overall public interest which lies in maintaining an appropriately accountable police force which is not distracted from its key tasks of safeguarding public safety and security.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>Following a two stage tender and evaluation process, a preferred bidder has been selected.  Following a cooling off period in accordance with standard procurement  procedures, the intention is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will shortly commence contract discussions with the preferred bidder.  A rollout of the network of cameras would commence following conclusion of a contract.  Rollout would involve a service start-up phase, which would include drawing up policy and procedures by the service provider and their approval by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; service testing, following which the Garda Commissioner would issue a service commencement certificate; and rollout of the service until operating at full capacity.</P>
        <P>Every effort is being made to proceed with the project as speedily as possible.  However, I am not in a position to indicate a specific timescale for the project until the contract discussions are concluded.</P>
        <P>In addition to the camera network, significant resources are being provided to enforce road traffic law and thereby increase road safety.  As well as increases which have taken place in personnel for the Traffic Corps, there has also been a significant increase in the financial resources provided for road traffic equipment, including for the replacement and upgrading of current mobile speed detection equipment and the introduction of an automated number plate recognition system.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that to date all significant arrests by the Garda National Drugs Unit in 2008 have involved adults. </P>
        <P>There is no evidence, currently to hand, to indicate that there is an increase in the use of juveniles by criminals for the purpose of drug-trafficking.  However there is no room for complacency on matters such as this and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to monitor any developments which indicate any such manipulation of young people for criminal purposes.</P>
        <P>Regardless of age, it is already an offence to incite another to commit a crime. The crime of incitement stands alone and does not depend on whether a substantive offence was committed. It is punishable by imprisonment and/or a fine with the duration and amount at the discretion of the court. Furthermore, the Criminal Law Act 1997 provides that any person who aids, <Col N="136"/>abets, counsels or procures the commission of an indictable offence is liable to be tried as the principal offender.</P>
        <P>My colleague the Minister for Children recently launched the National Youth Justice Strategy for 2008-2010. It is based on the principles of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and the Government&rsquo;s decision to reform the youth justice area.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Strategy is to develop a co-ordinated approach among agencies working in the youth justice system over the next three years. The Strategy acknowledges that the youth justice system is but one component in a broader community based approach for preventing youth offending that takes account of the wider family and social issues which need to be addressed by a number of agencies.</P>
        <P>In relation to any circumstances where a person, including a juvenile, is caught in possession of a controlled substance they may be arrested and processed for any relevant offences disclosed. The offences applicable would be possession of a controlled drug per section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977/84 or possession for sale and or supply per section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977/84.</P>
        <P>During any investigation of any such disclosed offence, if evidence comes to light of a juvenile being used by any other person for the purposes of transporting a controlled substance, then that person may be treated as a principal offender and prosecuted accordingly.</P>
        <P>Provision is also made in law for a juvenile, following the proper investigation of any alleged offences, to be processed under the Juvenile Diversion Programme.  The Juvenile Diversion Programme deals with juveniles who offend, by way of administering a formal or an informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the Courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.</P>
        <P>Furthermore there are currently 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects operating throughout the state with a mandate to divert young people from becoming involved or further involved in anti social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development and promote civic responsibility.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 102 together.</P>
        <P>The recorded crime figures for the first quarter of 2008 issued by the Central Statistics Office for the first time use the new Quarterly Irish Crime Classification System. This system includes some offences which were not previously classified as headline offences.</P>
        <P>These statistics, which have to be assessed against the background of an increasing population, show progress across a range of areas.</P>
        <P>In the statistics the group of homicide offences shows a significant drop year-on-year of 15.6%. This is primarily due to the level of dangerous driving causing death decreasing by more than half (although the Central Statistics Office caution that all road collision investigations for the period have not concluded which could result in some incidents being re-classified as homicides). While year-on-year cases of murder and manslaughter increased by 26.9% and remain at a completely unacceptable level, the trend has improved in the first quarter of 2008 where there has been no increase on the corresponding period in 2007. I expect further improvements to be manifest when figures for the second quarter are published.</P>
        <P>I commend the leadership and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a number of positive aspects to the figures. For example, robberies of an establishment or institution and of cash or goods in transit decreased year-on-year by 16.9% and 43.3% respectively. I also welcome the fact that what are classified as Controlled Drug Offences are up by 31% year-on-year. As with the increases in areas such as possession of offensive weapons and some disorderly conduct offences, such offences, of their nature, are only recorded if detected by the Garda&iacute; and, accordingly, represent the increased levels of activity in these areas.</P>
        <P>The increase in burglary and related offences which have recorded a year-on-year increase of 3.6% and quarter-on-quarter increase of 14.3% is a matter for concern. Whilst not high profile crimes they do cause understandable and enormous distress to the victims. I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is taking a series of measures to counteract the rising trend for these offences. These include identifying the blackspots and launching targeted operations against those involved in these activities.</P>
        <P>Whilst there has been an increase in the number of recorded incidents of public order offences from 2002 to 2007, this increase coincides with Operation Encounter, which was commenced by the then Garda Commissioner in February 2002 specifically to target public disorder and anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour and areas subject to such behaviour have been identified as hot-spots by local Garda management and additional foot patrols and mobile patrols, are directed in these areas during times when these offences are more likely to occur. All such incidents, detected by members on patrol or reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are dealt with immediately and the suspected offenders are dealt with in accordance with the law, including the provision of Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, the Criminal Damage Act 1991, and the Criminal Justice Act 2006.</P>
        <P>The increase in the number of public order offences recorded can be attributed in part to the continued increase in enforcement of public order legislation during the years 2002 to 2007. Over 480,000 offences have been detected since the commencement of Operation Encounter.</P><Col N="138"/>
        <P>The Commissioner recently held a Crime Conference with senior management at which the current crime levels were discussed along with sharing knowledge and best practice across the various initiatives and operations in place to target volume crime, organised crime and public order.</P>
        <P>I am informed that senior Garda management is satisfied that adequate resources are available to address these types of criminality, which are being targeted through various initiatives at national, regional, Divisional and District level. Personnel allocations are constantly monitored by local management.</P>

	<P>Following the approval of Government the details of my proposals for a Civil Partnership Bill were published on 24 June 2008. The Bill is now in the course of being drafted by Parliamentary Counsel. It is, I believe, generally acknowledged that the Bill, while being comprehensive, is very complex. It will require a good deal of consideration on the legal and technical aspects in the course of its formal drafting, which is expected to take a number of months. The details of the proposed Bill are on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>My Department (including the immigration and asylum areas) is required to operate within overall staffing levels approved by Government.  The staffing of the immigration and asylum areas is dealt with in the same manner as obtains across the Department and is determined by: the availability of staff; the competing priorities of the many critical areas of responsibility handled by my Department; and overall Government policy on Civil Service numbers.  Having said that, I am satisfied that the immigration and asylum areas are adequately resourced to meet the many challenges they face.  In the circumstances, the question of significant numbers of vacancies remaining unfilled in the context of other Departmental priorities does not arise.  </P>

	<P>The position is that the Licensing Acts already provide for a system of sequential closing of licensed premises. Existing legislation provides for a general closing time of 11.30 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday; 12.30 a.m on Friday and Saturday and 11.00 p.m. on Sunday. A further period of 30 minutes drinking-up time is also permitted.</P>
        <P>Special exemption orders which permit extended opening hours may be sought from the District Court for special occasions. A special exemption order expires where it extends to any Monday that is not a public holiday at 1.00 a.m., and in other cases at 2.30 a.m. Drinking-up time of 30 minutes is also permitted. The District Court may however grant an order for a shorter period for stated reasons, including public order reasons.</P>
        <P>Recently, there has been a substantial growth in the number of theatre licences which are not subject to the general rules concerning closing time but are permitted to sell intoxicating liquor both before and after performances. In 2007, 76 theatre licences were issued by the Revenue Commissioners. To date this year, over 150 have been issued. The increasing use of such licences to circumvent the special exemption order provisions is a source of concern and the Government Alcohol Advisory Group has recommended that the general closing time rules should also apply to theatres.</P>
        <P>Sections 9 and 10 of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008, which is before the House, contain proposals to give effect to the recommendations of the Advisory Group. In future, holders of theatre licences will be permitted to apply for special exemption orders under the same rules as other licensees. This is a necessary step in order to address problems arising from the increased availability of such licences and will ensure equality of treatment for all premises operating as late night venues.</P>

	<P>Over the last number of years the Government has of course been aware of and concerned by the increasing prevalence of cocaine use in Ireland. We are not alone in this as this development reflects increasing use of the drug across all of Europe in recent times.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy points out, the drug prevalence study recently produced by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) which measured illegal drug use in Ireland over the period 2006/2007 confirmed that there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of cocaine use here albeit from a low level.  These results present a challenge for us all in the development of our new National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.</P>
        <P>Prior to the completion of this study, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) and the National Drug Strategy Team (NDST) prepared a joint briefing paper on cocaine, based on existing data in Ireland. This paper was presented to the Interdepartmental Drugs Group in September 2006.</P>
        <P>The paper, which was published as part of a wider study on cocaine published in March 2007, concluded that all data sources indicated an upward trend in cocaine use here.  A number of recommendations are made in the paper, principally in regard to treatment, but also covering supply, prevention and research.</P>
        <P>The Interdepartmental Drugs Group, chaired by my colleague Minister of State John Curran T.D., is currently liaising with the relevant Departments and Agencies in relation to their implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.</P>
        <P>From the law enforcement perspective, one of the primary functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  is to reduce the supply of all illegal drugs including cocaine.</P>
        <P>The steps taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address the illicit supply of cocaine and indeed all illegal drugs include the following:</P>
       <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />The on-going investigation and intelligence gathering by the Garda National Drugs Unit in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, both national &amp; international including the Customs Service.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />The investigation and intelligence gathering by other National Units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau  and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation whose activities relate to organised crime &amp; drug trafficking.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />The ongoing investigation and activities by Divisional &amp; District Drug Units operating throughout the State which have been established with the specific remit of targeting individuals engaged in the sale and distribution of drugs to local communities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These units are supported by local resources as well as National Units including the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Garda Technical Bureau, the Forensic Science Laboratory and the Garda specialist services section.</P><Col N="142"/>
        <P>Internationally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with relevant law enforcement agencies including with other E.U. Agencies, the US Drugs Enforcement Agency and Interpol and Europol.  Presently An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have liaison officers based in the Hague, London, Paris, Madrid, Europol and Interpol.</P>
        <P>In addition, the recently established Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (Narcotics) MAOC(N) in Lisbon, of which Ireland is a founding member is a focused initiative which has the specific objective of intercepting narcotic shipments, in particular cocaine, to the European Union from Latin America. A Garda Liaison Officer will soon be based permanently at the centre.</P>
        <P>The volume and value of cocaine seizures which continue to be made by the Garda&iacute;  demonstrates that such strategies are resulting in significant operational successes.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly, this is ongoing work in progress and the Government fully acknowledges that tackling the problem of all drug trafficking remains an ongoing challenge to be faced with vigilance.</P>
        <P>In concluding, I would also like to reiterate the point I have made previously on the drugs issue which is to stress that while the State clearly has responsibilities in these matters, the fact is that all of us as Irish citizens have choices to make and responsibilities to uphold with regard to drug use as it is the demand for drugs which fuels the drugs trade.</P>
        <P>Finally I would like to assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the measures and resources for tackling all forms of drug trafficking, including cocaine, under review.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are sufficient resources and infrastructures in place to provide training for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are authorised to carry Firearms Authorisation Cards.  Cardholders are required to attend for refresher training three times per year which is significantly more than the average international policing standards. </P>
        <P>There has been considerable investment in training facilities over the past two years and I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  that two Prefabricated Modular Firearms ranges have been installed and are operational at the Garda College  and, more recently, at a new facility in Tallaght.  These prefabricated ranges are newly designed products that facilitate live fire shooting for up to four persons in a carefully contained environment which adheres to all range safety requirements.  In addition, three Firearms Automated Training Systems (FATS) units were introduced in January 2007. FATS training has allowed the development of judgmental firearms training as well as traditional marksmanship training in a non-live fire environment.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Specialist Training Unit also make use of Military ranges throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Garda firearms training and facilities are constantly reviewed to ensure sufficient and appropriate training is provided.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of licensed firearms has increased by approx 5% over the last five years.  On the other hand, figures from the Central Statistics Office indicate that the population grew by over 8% between 2002 and 2006 so, while there has been a small increase in the number of licensed firearms in recent years, in real terms the number of firearms per capita has decreased.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that our definition of what constitutes a firearm is among the most stringent to be found in any jurisdiction. Under the Firearms Act 1925, any device with a muzzle energy greater that one joule is regarded as a firearm. Many countries, for example, do not require a licence for a wide range of sporting firearms which are all treated as part of the firearms regime here.</P><Col N="144"/>
        <P>Nevertheless since my appointment, I have been concerned at the increasing number of handguns being licensed, which follows a series of court decisions favourable to persons seeking licenses. Sections 30 and 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provide for a new, stricter licensing regime for what are termed as &lsquo;restricted&rsquo; firearms, which include the vast majority of handguns. Certain technical amendments are necessary in relation to their implementation and work has been proceeding on these. I also directed that consideration be given to what further measures may be necessary to tighten up the legislation in this regard.</P>
        <P>Following consultations with the Attorney General and the Garda Commissioner, I will bring forward proposals to the Cabinet with a view to introducing legislation early in the next Parliamentary session dealing with this matter. This will reflect the outcome of a short, intensive review of the relevant legislative provisions which I have directed take place.</P>
        <P>While I am aware that the vast majority of persons with licensed firearms pursue their interests legitimately, public safety has to be the paramount consideration and I will take whatever action is necessary to ensure that that is put beyond doubt in our laws.</P>

	<P>Consideration of the issue of heroin misuse in Ireland needs to take place in the global context within which such misuse takes place.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime estimates that approximately 90% of the heroin which is consumed in the European Union originates from Afghanistan.</P>
        <P>The sharp increase both in cultivation and production of illicit opium poppy in Afghanistan in recent years continues to result in an increasing supply of the drug being available right across the European Union, including in Ireland.</P>
        <P>This development is reflected in the increasing level of seizures of the drugs which have been made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na here in recent times.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in association with its international law enforcement partners continues to monitor world trends in illicit drug production.  Notwithstanding any worldwide fluctuations in the production of the poppy crop, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains vigilant for any signs of increased or intensified flow of heroin into this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Whilst there has been a significant increase in the seizures of heroin in this country since 2005 there is no evidence of a corresponding increase in demand for heroin.  The table shows seizures of heroin from 2001 to 2008 up to date (up to and including 4 July).  It should be noted that the figures shown for 2007/2008 are provisional/operational and may be subject to change.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly these are very significant volumes of the drug which have been seized by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I warmly commend their ongoing work in this regard.</P><Col N="145"/>
        <P>I am further advised by the Garda authorities that the increase in the amount of heroin seized in recent years is directly attributable to increased law enforcement and the conducting of intelligence driven operations at various levels which are coordinated by the Garda National Drugs Unit in association with other Garda Units such as the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
        <P>The steps taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address the illicit supply of heroin and indeed all illegal drugs include the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />The on-going investigation and intelligence gathering by the Garda National Drugs Unit in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, both national &amp; international including the Customs Service.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />The investigation and intelligence gathering by other National Units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau  and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation whose activities relate to organised crime &amp; drug trafficking.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />The ongoing investigation and activities by Divisional &amp; District Drug Units operating throughout the State.</P>
        <P FLI="0">At a local level Divisional and District Drug Units have been established with the specific remit of targeting individuals engaged in the sale and distribution of drugs to local communities.</P>
        <P>These units are supported by local resources as well as National Units including the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Garda Technical Bureau, the Forensic Science Laboratory and the Garda specialist services section.</P>
        <P>Internationally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with relevant law enforcement agencies including with other E.U. Agencies, the US Drugs Enforcement Agency and Interpol and Europol.</P>
        <P>Presently An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have liaison officers based in the Hague, London, Paris, Madrid, Europol and Interpol.  An Garda S&iacute;&oacute;ch&aacute;na was directly involved in the establishment of a Maritime Analysis Operations Centre for Narcotics (MAOCN) which is tasked with countering illicit drug trafficking at sea.  A Garda Liaison Officer will soon be based permanently at the centre.</P>

	<P>The recent increase in the use of pipe bombs and other improvised explosive devices (IEDs) is a matter of concern to me. That concern is shared by the Garda Commissioner. </P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all available intelligence is fully analysed and used in the strategic deployment of both local and specialised operational Garda units in pursuing persons and groups who use pipe bombs and similar devices in their criminal activities.</P>
        <P>Both uniformed and plain-clothes patrols and checkpoints by Garda&iacute; have been increased in the areas targeted by these attacks.  Intelligence-led operations are ongoing, including searches and arrests aimed at preventing attacks and the apprehension of persons suspected of being involved in such attacks.  The resources of Operation Anvil and the Organised Crime Unit are focused on apprehending the criminals using these devices.</P>
        <P>Over the last number of months, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has focused on individuals involved in this type of criminality. A number of search operations have taken place with the object of identifying the source(s) of these devices. A quantity of such devices has been seized, resulting in persons being arrested and charged. These persons remain before the courts.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that in May 2007 a Detective Superintendent was appointed to co-ordinate investigation of incidents involving the use of hand grenades and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) within the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) for the period from 2005. The Superintendent is also tasked with establishing whether there were any links or associations in cases where IEDs have been used in the DMR.</P>
        <P>All incidents of this nature are the subject of a thorough investigation by the relevant District Officer and his investigation team, with ongoing support from the relevant operational and technical units of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with assistance as required from the Defence Forces.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 127 together.</P><Col N="147"/>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to decide on the prioritisation and allocation of resources within the force. The Commissioner has informed me that, as of 31 May 2008, the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Juvenile Liaison Service was 101. The Garda Commissioner has given a commitment to appoint an additional 21 personnel by 2010. Of course, while these officers are specifically dedicated to this service, a significant number of Garda&iacute; are engaged in liaising with juveniles on a day-to-day basis.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner has also pointed out that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>
        <P>The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. It also enables referral to the Garda Youth Diversion Projects which operate separately from the Diversion Programme. These Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour.   There are currently 100 of these projects operating throughout the country.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Obviously, given the clandestine nature of this illegal activity it is extremely difficult to quantify with any degree of certainty the proportion of drug seizures made in this jurisdiction by our law enforcement authorities in relation to the overall volumes of drugs being trafficked. Any estimate is, therefore, speculative.</P>
        <P>According to the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the global illicit drug trade is reputed to exceed billions of US$ annually.  That office estimated in 2005 that global seizures for that year accounted for 44% of cocaine production, 28% of cannabis resin, 25% of opium production, 7% of amphetamines and 4.7% of ecstasy.</P>
        <P>As I am sure the Deputy appreciates, drug misuse remains one of the most complex social ills faced globally. Our drug law enforcement response is of course a vital feature of our overall response in addressing the issue but we cannot just look at the issue from a supply reduction perspective only.  Rather, we must examine the drugs problem in the wider context in which it takes place and take cognisance of the fact that the demand for and the use of illegal drugs is what fuels the drugs trade. The measures that we have in place to address the problem must take account of this.</P>
        <P>The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the problem through our current National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.</P>
        <P>The National Drugs Strategy addresses the problem under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.</P>
        <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of my colleague and Minister of State Mr. John Curran, T.D., is the lead Government Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the current strategy and is presently involved in a wide-ranging consultative process in developing our new Strategy for the years 2009-2016.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s remit in this area, while not exclusively, is primarily in the area of drug supply reduction, and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government&rsquo;s drug policy framework.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na invokes a number of broad strategic responses in addressing the issue. These include the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />Identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within this state.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />Conducting intelligence-driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />Working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs trade.</P><Col N="149"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />Working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We must acknowledge the fact that both the Garda&iacute; and the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners continue to be very successful with regard to the numbers of drug seizures they are making, the quantity of drugs being seized and number of convictions being obtained.</P>
        <P>This is reflected, for example, in the 117 kilograms of heroin seized last year by the Garda&iacute; with seizures at a similar level continuing this year.  Both these services are using an intelligence-led approach to interrupt supply. I warmly commend both agencies for their work in this regard.</P>
        <P>This work is ongoing and both law enforcement agencies will continue to pursue these strategies and continue to tackle organised crime and drug trafficking primarily through the use of specialist units and targeted intelligence led operations.</P>
        <P>To further assist in our law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking, a number of new initiatives have been recently introduced. Some examples of this includes the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />The establishment in January 2008 of the Organised Crime Unit on a permanent footing with full time staff assigned to it. The Unit now has a personnel strength of seventy and, in conjunction with the Garda National Drugs Unit and local Garda&iacute;, will continue to implement initiatives such as Operations Anvil and Oak which target criminals involved in the trafficking of drugs.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />The recently established Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (Narcotics) MAOC(N) in Lisbon, of which Ireland is a founding member. The Centre has the specific objective of intercepting narcotic shipments, in particular cocaine, to the European Union from Latin America.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />A number of provisions introduced in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 have provided for further measures which will enhance the powers of the Garda&iacute; in the investigation and prosecution of drug offences.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the measures and resources for tackling all forms of drug trafficking under review. The enforcement of the law relating to drugs continues to be a key element in the Government&rsquo;s policing priorities and this is reflected in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Policing Plan for 2008.</P>

        <P>The aim of a Garda Charter is to improve customer service and responsiveness.  The Charter will set out targeted response times and levels of service the public can expect, including the frequency of high visibility patrols in urban and rural communities.</P>
        <P>The Garda Inspectorate has been requested to examine the allocation of Garda resources and also to provide advice on the development of a Garda Charter as proposed in the Programme for Government and I look forward to receiving its advice.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>   if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the number of suspected money laundering offences here rose by 10% in 2007 to an all-time high; his views on this development; if he has concrete proposals to target money launderers and to strengthen money-laundering legislation; if he has read the 2006 report on Ireland by the Financial Action Task Force; if he proposes to update Ireland&rsquo;s legal framework on the basis of this report; the position regarding Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of the third EU Money Laundering Directive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will know, effective anti-money laundering legislation has been in place in this jurisdiction since the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.  Later amendments to this Act are contained in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.  These statutes ensure our full compliance with the 1st and 2nd EU Money Laundering Directives.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the increased levels of reporting of suspicious transactions to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The financial services sector and other bodies whose members are affected by this legislation, including the Law Society and organisations representing the accountancy profession, make considerable efforts to ensure that their members are fully aware of the provisions of current anti-money laundering legislation and of the requirements to report any suspicious transactions to the authorities.  I am of the view that the increase in reports of this nature to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a positive indication of greater levels of awareness on the part of many people whose job involves them in dealing with financial transactions which could be used for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing.</P>
        <P>While our current anti-money laundering legislation is of a high standard, we must remain vigilant and as necessary continue to strengthen the law in relation to combating both money laundering and terrorist financing.  To that end my Department is working closely with the Department of Finance on the transposition of the 3rd EU Money Laundering Directive into Irish law.  In that regard the Government approved the drafting of a Money Laundering Bill on 12 February last.  The Government also gave approval for the publication, on my Department&rsquo;s website, of the General Scheme of the proposed Bill and for the initiation of a consultation process involving all interested parties who wished to comment on the proposals.  An extensive consultation process followed, which has now been completed.  During the course of this process, a range of bodies met with my officials and made both written and oral submissions on the legislation.  Bodies who participated in this process included the Irish Bankers Federation, the Law Society, the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, the Irish Taxation Institute and the Combat Poverty Agency, as well as a number of leading commercial law firms and other groups.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 2006 Report on Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing measures.  I note that the Report was broadly positive regarding Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory regime in relation to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing.  It stated that &ldquo;Ireland has a broad money laundering offence which meets the Financial Action task Force requirements&rdquo;.  The Report also pointed out that &ldquo;Adequate powers are available to the Garda, the CAB and the Revenue Commissioners to gather evidence and to compel the production of financial records and files from financial institutions&rdquo;.  The FATF 2006 Report did identify a small number of areas where our anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regime could be strengthened and in that context it is my intention <Col N="151"/>to ensure that the provisions of the proposed Money Laundering Bill will combine both the requirements set out in the 3rd EU Money Laundering Directive and the recommendations contained in the FATF 2006 Report.  Drafting of the Money Laundering Bill is now underway, and officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel are working closely together to ensure completion of drafting of this measure as soon as possible.  It is my intention when drafting is completed, to bring this Bill to Government to seek approval for its publication at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

	<P>The Domestic Violence Act 1996 makes substantial provision for victims of domestic violence who are not married to their abuser.  A person may apply for a safety order if he or she has been living with a person as husband and wife for six months in aggregate of the previous twelve, and may apply for a barring order if he or she has been living with a person for six months in aggregate of the previous nine.  </P>
        <P>I have proposed certain changes to the Domestic Violence Acts in the General Scheme of the Civil Partnership Bill which I published on 24 June 2008.  These changes will extend the protections of the Domestic Violence Acts to same-sex couples who register as civil partners. Aspects of the law in relation to cohabitants will be considered in the context of development of the Bill.</P>

        <Quest>   if he will make a statement, including the implications for Ireland, on the finding of the European Court of Human Rights on 1 July 2008 that the rules governing data interception in the UK are in breach of the right to privacy under Article 8 of the Convention.   </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Lawful interception in this jurisdiction is governed by the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.  That Act sets out clearly the conditions justifying interception for the purposes of criminal investigation or in the interests of the security of the State.  It also sets out clearly the procedures required to authorise an interception.  In particular, the Act provides that an authorisation to intercept may only be granted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform following an application which may be made only by the Garda Commissioner or by the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, with the latter requiring a recommendation of the Minister for Defence supporting the application.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the 1993 Act a Designated Judge of the High Court is charged with keeping the operation of the legislative provisions under review, of ascertaining whether these provisions are being complied with and reporting at least annually to the Taoiseach on these matters.  The Designated Judge is completely independent in his oversight <Col N="152"/>function.  The Deputy will be aware that in all previous reports to the Taoiseach the Designated Judge has expressed satisfaction that the statutory provisions are being complied with.</P>
        <P>The legislation also provides for a separate Complaints Referee, who is currently a Judge of the Circuit Court.  Persons may apply to the Complaints Referee for an investigation if they consider that there may have been a contravention of the Act.  The Complaints Referee is completely independent in his functions and must report any contraventions found to the Taoiseach.  Such reporting provides a further safeguard in relation to the State&rsquo;s lawful interception through the provision of an independent complaints procedure for members of the public who believe that a communication sent to or by them may have been intercepted.  The Deputy will note that no such report has been received by the Taoiseach, which indicates that the Complaints Referee has never to date concluded, on investigation of a complaint, that there has been a contravention of the relevant provisions of the 1993 Act.</P>
        <P>The 1993 Act does not permit the issue of warrants of the type which were found by the European Court of Human Rights to be in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.  The mass interception of external communications is not a feature of our lawful interception regime.  I believe that the statutory provisions in place in this jurisdiction provide a sound framework, with robust safeguards for the public, with regard to lawful interceptions.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>   the number of criminal gangs known to be currently operating here; if the leaders, principals or gang members are operating from overseas, from prison, are free or on bail; the number who are wanted here or overseas on foot of serious crimes; if warrants have issued in all cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed that there are two categories of organised crime groups operating in this jurisdiction.  The first category consists of individuals / groups that are well established and tightly structured and are involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences.  The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.  Details in relation to such groups is disseminated on a regular basis to Europol.</P>
        <P>The membership of organised gangs tends to be fluid and the nature of criminal activity is such that offences committed by members of gangs may or may not be connected with the individual&rsquo;s membership of such gangs.  It is therefore not possible to accurately attribute specific figures to the membership or activity of such gangs.</P>
        <P>Organised criminal gangs operating in this jurisdiction are targeted on an ongoing basis and profiles regarding the personnel of such groups are continually updated.  Their members, operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are likewise proactively targeted and intelligence-led operations, primarily undertaken by specialist units of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, under the remit of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau are regularly undertaken, targeting those suspected of being involved in Organised Crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains liaison with other law enforcement agencies throughout Europe, and elsewhere, exchanging information and intelligence on Irish criminals living abroad.  This ongoing liaison has led to a number of successful joint operations targeting the <Col N="153"/>attempted importations of drugs and firearms.  This has resulted in a number of significant arrests here and in other jurisdictions.  Where intelligence, supported by evidence, is available, law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions put operations in place, as appropriate, in cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent and detect such criminality.</P>
        <P>Where information exists that a person, who is wanted in relation to a particular crime in this jurisdiction is living abroad and where the particular legal requirements apply, extradition is sought or an application is made for a European Arrest Warrant.</P>
        <P>Where there is justification and a legal basis, those suspected of involvement in criminal activity are arrested, detained and questioned in relation to specific crime.  A member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must, at all times, have reasonable grounds to believe that an individual has been involved in criminal activity before they can arrest and question any person in relation to criminality.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a party to various International Conventions which provide for assistance in criminal matters between jurisdictions.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na send and receive requests for assistance via the Central Authority for Mutual Assistance at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Requests for Assistance may also be dealt with on the basis of reciprocity where certain jurisdictions may not be a party to specific conventions.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to use all available means to ensure that those engaged in criminal activities are brought before the Courts regardless of the location from which they operate.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table contains the number of cases of murder recorded in which firearms were used, the number of prosecutions initiated and the number of convictions secured in each year from 1998 to 2007 and in 2008 up to the end of May.  Figures provided for 2008 are provisional, operational and liable to change.</P>
        <P>The detection rate for murders by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that in respect of each year the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and the number of proceedings commenced are <Col N="154"/>finalised by the courts.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder.  Furthermore such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.</P>
        <P>There can be considerable difficulties for the Garda&iacute; in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities.  This arises not least because many of the associates of such victims will not co-operate with the Garda investigation.  Nevertheless, the Garda&iacute; are determined to pursue rigorously all killings, whatever their background.</P>

	<P>Restorative justice principles underpin the Children Act, 2001, as amended.  The Act introduced a comprehensive set of restorative justice provisions, all with the aim of diverting children from further criminal behaviour by making the offenders more directly accountable for their actions and by giving a greater voice to victims of crime.  Essentially, there are two approaches to restorative justice provided for in the Act.  The first approach is set out in Part 4 of the Act under the statutory diversion programme, as operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This provides for restorative cautions (Section 26) and restorative conferences (Section 29).  The second approach is set out under Sections 78-87 of the Children Act 2001, where a court may direct the Probation Service to arrange for a family conference.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Restorative events under the Garda Diversion Programme are applied only to young persons who have already been accepted as suitable for admission to the programme.  Therefore, the question of prosecution and possible detention does not arise in relation to these cases.</P>
        <P>Under Section 78 of the Act, the Probation Service may be directed by the court to arrange for a family conference in cases where (a) the child accepts responsibility, (b) the Court thinks a family conference is desirable and (c) the child and child&rsquo;s family agree and are able to make <Col N="156"/>a positive contribution to the conference.  The aim is to formulate an action plan which will be overseen by the Probation Service.  Failure on the part of the child to comply with the plan may result in the case being returned to court.  The sanction in respect of these cases is a matter for the court, but could involve either detention or other community sanctions.  The Probation Service has advised me that the following are the most recent statistics available for family conferences:&mdash;</P>

	<P>The profit outflows of foreign owned multinational corporations operating in Ireland are not directly available for this period.  However, the Net Factor Outflows shown in the table below largely reflect these accrued profit outflows and are given from 1976 to date.  The geographical analysis of the destination of these outflows is only available for the years 2001-2007 and therefore the table below only presents the proportion of EU based recipients of the total accrued outflows from 2001 onwards.  The latest data available for 2008 relate to the first quarter, and were published on 30 June 2008.  These figures show that the Net Factor Outflows in this quarter were &euro;6,717m (the equivalent amount for the first quarter in 2007 amounted to &euro;7,733m).</P>

The Terms of Reference of this review include an examination of: the extent to which the objectives of NESDO have been achieved and the effectiveness with which they have been achieved; and the current usage by NESDO and its constituent bodies of the Grant-in-Aid funding in value for money terms and evaluation of alternative policy, organisational, structural or funding approaches to achieving its objectives against efficiency and cost effective criteria. </P>

	<P>The value for money review by the Commissioners of Public Works of the maintenance of Garda premises is an ongoing exercise, the results of which are reported to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform at six-monthly intervals.  The costs of maintenance works undertaken are benchmarked against equivalent private sector operations.  Improvements in terms of procurement or administration of maintenance processes identified in the course of the review, are adopted.  It is not possible at this stage to quantify direct savings arising from the report.</P>

	<P>The Business Expansion Scheme (BES) provides a tax incentive to private investors to invest long-term equity capital in companies (particularly new and smaller ones), operating in certain sectors of the economy.  Its purpose is to encourage investment in companies which would otherwise find it difficult to raise such funding and would instead have to rely on loan finance which can be difficult for small and start-up companies to obtain.  Provided an investor holds his or her investment for a minimum period of 5 years, the BES provides individual investors with tax relief, at their marginal tax rate, in respect of investments of up to &euro;150,000 per annum in companies engaged in certain activities, especially in sectors such as manufacturing, services, tourism, and Research and Development.  The scheme was designed with a view to the creation and maintenance of employment.</P><Col N="175"/>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated tax cost of the Business Expansion Scheme and the amount of investment raised since it was created is as set out in the following table.</P>

	<P>The aim of the Performance Management &amp; Development System (PMDS) is to provide a framework for aligning individual and team performance with the goals of the organisation, through greater clarity in setting objectives and related performance targets, and for monitoring progress of their achievement.  It also provides a context in which the development needs of jobholders can be addressed.  </P>
        <P>In 2005, on foot of commitments in Sustaining Progress, management and unions in the Civil Service reached agreement on the integration of PMDS with wider HR policies and processes, including assessment systems.  In particular, the ratings resulting from annual assessments are now, in addition to their use for staff development purposes, linked to the awarding of annual increments, assignments to higher scales and access to promotion competitions.  The annual assessment is based on a uniform five-point scale for all grades.</P>
        <P>The integrated PMDS system was introduced in 2006 for training and familiarisation purposes only.  From 2007, on ratings inform decisions relating to increments, higher scales and promotions.  In accordance with the arrangements agreed with the Civil Service unions, a formal evaluation of the revised model will commence in 2009.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 to 161, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The review of the Information Society Fund was completed in August 2006.  The fund terminated at the end of 2005 in line with its intended lifespan. As a result, an annual allocation for the fund is no longer required.  However, expenditure in each of the final three years of the programme was as follows: 2005, &euro;8.872m; 2004, &euro;5.233m; 2003, &euro;7.767m.</P>
        <P>I expect that the review of the Civil Service Childcare Initiative will be completed shortly and that the reviews of Procurement Management Reform and Departmental Procurement will be completed by the end of 2008.  The Office of Public Works expects that the review of the Flood Relief Schemes will be completed very shortly and that the review of the Property Management Scheme review will be completed by the end of 2008.  It is not possible to anticipate the consequences of these reports until their findings are finalised, considered and implemented.	</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that following the introduction of the Single Market in 1993, customs officers were integrated into the general service grades in Revenue.  This process was completed by 1996 and therefore the information requested is not available.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that customs and excise functions, including frontier management, trade facilitation, customs policy and legislation, customs valuation, excise controls, and customs and excise investigation and prosecutions were assigned in the main to three divisions during this period.  The number of employees in the three divisions, which carried out a broad range of other functions, including trade statistics, local tax collection, P35 processing, vehicle registration tax and matters relating to charities and residence, during the years in question was as follows: 1999, 1,626; 2000, 1,622; 2001, 1,568; 2002, 1,572; and 2003, 1,554.</P>

        <P>The Office of Public Works manages 750 national monuments that are in direct State care.  Conservation plans are considered for national monuments that pose significant issues in the context of the overall preservation, presentation and management of the monument and where external factors may have a major impact on the site.  Most national monuments do not require a formal conservation plan.  Maintenance and conservation of monuments is achieved by way of an annual works programme devised by conservation architects of the Office of Public Works.  Hore Abbey, Cashel Dominican Friary, Kilcooley Abbey and Cahir Abbey are included in this programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government decided in May 2004 to introduce reform measures in respect of the procurement of public works projects and the engagement and settlement of fees for construction consultants.  The reforms are a key value for money initiative introduced to address concerns about the extent of cost overruns (the difference between the tender price accepted and the final outturn cost) on public works con<Col N="180"/>tracts and the way fees were paid to construction consultants employed on public works projects.  New fixed price lump sum contracts with optimal risk transfer were developed to achieve greater cost certainty at tender stage, better value for money and more efficient delivery of projects.  Fixed price contracts with more client focused, standardised conditions for the employment of construction consultants were also developed.  The revised arrangements came into effect on 19 February 2007.  A transition period was allowed to permit projects in the pipeline with advanced designs to proceed on the basis of the existing forms of contract.  The transition period ended on 13 February 2008.  Contracts for all projects after that date, other than a small number mainly in the water services area, to which I have given a further derogation, have to be awarded using the new public works contracts or the conditions of engagement for consultants in line with the Government reform initiative.  It is too early at this stage to provide a realistic estimate of savings arising from the reform measures.  It is essential that the calculation of savings is based on a realistic representative sample of completed projects and a review of the performance of the new procedures will be undertaken by my Department in consultation with the relevant procuring authorities when the appropriate information is available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of member states.  In the Irish context, these derogations allowed <i>inter alia</i> for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services, including school transport services.  While the derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other member states, sought retention of them beyond that date.  The European Commission, which is the deciding authority, refused such requests.  As the Deputy is aware, the Finance Act 2008 set out the legislative changes to withdraw the relief in respect of fuel used for public passenger transport vehicles.  The relief will be withdrawn from 1 November 2008 and the appropriate full excise rates will apply from that date.  In such circumstances, the question of reconsidering or deferring the withdrawal of the existing relief does not arise.  The Department of Transport and other relevant line Departments have, in conjunction with my Department, explored alternative mechanisms that might be used to direct Exchequer resources toward such services from that date, subject to compatibility with competition and EU state aid requirements.  While the matter is still being considered it is necessary to stress, despite the claims being made otherwise, that introducing an alternative suitable mechanism is not a straightforward matter.</P>

        <P>The amount paid under the fuel duty rebate scheme for public transport vehicles in each month in 2007 and to date in 2008 is set out in the table that follows this reply.  The cost of the relief under the fuel rebate scheme for public transport vehicles, in terms of excise foregone, is approximately &euro;30 million per annum.  As the Deputy is aware, the 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of member states.  In the Irish context, the derogations allowed <i>inter alia</i> <Col N="182"/>for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.  While the derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other member states, sought retention of them beyond that date.

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a voluntary early retirement scheme.  No such scheme is available to staff in the Civil Service.  However, there are other arrangements which make provision for retirement earlier than normal pension age in certain circumstances.  Arrangements for cost-neutral early retirement were introduced in 2005 under Department of Finance Circular 10/2005 and are available in the Civil and Public Service generally.  In broad terms this facility, which was recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions, allows staff who are within ten years of their normal pension age to apply for early retirement with immediate payment of their superannuation benefits.  The benefits are actuarially reduced to ensure that the early payment is cost-neutral to the Exchequer.  Retirement before normal pension age with immediate payment of superannuation benefits may be permitted on medical grounds.  Superannuation benefits may also be paid to a Civil Servant before normal pension age as a consequence of the abolition of his or her post or removal from office to facilitate improvements in the organisation of the Department by which greater efficiency and economy can be effected.</P>

To date no such documents have been produced.  Regarding the payment of vehicle registration tax by instalments there is no provision for such an arrangement under the legislation.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, having regard to the position set out in the previous reply to the Deputy, it is still their intention to cease the issue of TDCs from Jan 2009.  To accommodate those Employers requiring a TDC after this date Revenue intends to provide an enhanced version of the existing TDC on their website www.revenue.ie later this year.  This will allow an Employer to enter Employee details and automatically calculate the weekly/fortnightly/monthly deductions as they were previously shown on the TDC.  This web based TDC can then be printed and used in the same way as the existing TDC.</P>
        <P>Revenue will continue to issue paper Tax Credit Certificates to Employers who are currently receiving TDCs.  These certificates contain all the information required to enable an Employer to operate the PAYE system.</P>
        <P>Revenue will continue to remind Employers that TDCs will be discontinued from January 2009 and to inform them of the options they will have in relation to receiving pay and tax details for their Employees from that date.  An Employer who is seeking further information or assistance on this matter should contact the Employers Helpline at 1890 25 45 65.</P>

Therefore, it would not be normal procedure for me to receive communication from the Department of Finance representative on the F&Aacute;S board or the audit committee and accordingly, I have received no briefings, oral or written, on the internal audit report in question.</P><Col N="185"/>
        <P>Officials of my Department brief Ministers for Finance on an ongoing basis about policy matters arising in F&Aacute;S and did so in the period 2000 to 2008.  This was not done in their capacity as members of the F&Aacute;S Board.</P>
        <P>As a member of the board of F&Aacute;S, the representatives from the Department of Finance along with all other non executive board members are required to bring effective and independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance, resources, standards of conduct etc.  The Department of Finance representative on the board of F&Aacute;S can also contribute specific expertise in areas such as public finances, value for money as well as wider public policy that can help to contribute to the more effective functioning of the board.</P>

        <P>In addition to the CGT rate applicable to capital gains, a number of other factors impact upon the CGT yield in any particular year, including the prevailing property market and the general economic circumstances.

As a result, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the CGT yields on a basis as if the rate was not reduced in the 1998 Budget.</P>

	<P>Section 125 of the Finance Act 2006 (now Section 891B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) empowered the Revenue Commissioners, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, to make regulations requiring certain financial institutions, such as banks, credit unions, investment funds and assurance companies, to make automatic annual reports to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to certain payments (including interest) that they make to their customers.  Regulations to this effect were made on 6 May 2008 in S.I No. 136 of 2008 entitled Return of Payments (Banks, Building Societies, Credit Unions and Savings Banks) Regulations 2008.  This legislation was broadly in line with a recommendation from the Revenue Powers Group, established by the then Minister for Finance in 2003, which found reporting arrangements of this kind to be a common feature in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>In the case of Irish banks and building societies, the regulations require reports of certain deposit interest to be made to Revenue for the years 2005 et seq.  The first such reports are due on 15 September 2008.  In tandem with this reporting date, Revenue has announced a voluntary disclosure scheme focused on large (i.e. greater than &euro;100,000) bank and building society deposits where the funds relate to taxable sources not declared for tax purposes.</P>
        <P>Unlike in the case of banks and building societies, the first reports from credit unions will be for interest paid to certain deposit account holders in the year 2008 and the first such reports are not due until 31 March 2009.  Furthermore, dividends that relate to share accounts for periods prior to the end of 2008 are not reportable.  In general it is only accounts and investments that pay interest or dividends of &euro;635 or more in aggregate in a year that are to be reported on.  This threshold is however subject to an anti-account splitting provision which requires that interest or dividends that are paid for all new accounts opened on or after 1 January 2008 to be reported in the first year that any such interest or dividends payments are made.</P><Col N="188"/>
        <P>The primary purpose behind the new regulations is to encourage taxpayers to be generally more compliant and to limit the scope for using domestic financial institutions as a &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo; for depositing significant taxable funds that have not been disclosed for tax purposes.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have emphasised that the information that they receive on foot of these new reporting requirements will be used only for the identification of significant risk.  Revenue has given public assurances that anyone who has placed funds with a domestic financial institution (including a credit union) by way of savings from after tax income or by way of a legitimate gift or inheritance has nothing to fear from these new reporting requirements and there is no need for them to contact Revenue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201, 247 and 251 together.</P>
        <P>The Government in 2001 made a commitment, in the context of the Health Strategy Quality and Fairness, to increase public acute hospital bed numbers by 3,000 over ten years.  This commitment included both acute in-patient beds and day places.  The Government is substantially on target to reach this objective.  In 2001 the average number of in-patient beds and day places available in the 53 public acute hospitals was 12,145, based on returns to the Department (11,374 in-patient beds and 771 day places).  The number of acute hospital beds recorded by the Health Service Executive for 2006 was 13,771 (12,574 in-patient beds and 1,197 day places) based on a total bed complement.  This represents an increase of over 1,600, an average of some 325 new bed and day places per year, a very high level of annual increase by historic standards.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to provide an additional 1,500 public acute hospital beds.  About 1,000 of these will be provided through the co-location initiative and the balance through the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s (HSE&rsquo;s) capital plan, which is part of the National Development Plan.  The co-location initiative aims to deliver approximately 1,000 of these beds for public patients through the development of private hospitals on public sites.  The intention is to transfer private activity to those hospitals thereby freeing up capacity for public patients.  The Board of the Health Service Executive (HSE) has approved preferred bidders for six co-located hospital sites: Beaumont Hospital, Cork University Hospital, Limerick Regional Hospital, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Waterford Regional Hospital, Sligo General Hospital.</P>
        <P>The Project Agreements for Limerick Regional Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and Cork University Hospital have been signed.  Planning permission has been granted by the local authorities concerned for the co-located hospitals at Beaumont and at Cork University Hospital.  Planning permission for the Beaumont and Cork projects has been appealed to an Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The HSE has advised my Department that a decision to grant planning permission for the Limerick Regional Hospital project was given in mid June and that this decision is scheduled to be made final later this month subject to no planning appeal being lodged.</P>
        <P>The HSE advise that the Project Agreements for St. James Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital are expected to be signed shortly.  The HSE expects the Sligo Project Agreement to <Col N="191"/>be concluded by the autumn.  Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, which are also participating in the co-location initiative, are at an earlier stage of the procurement process.  Connolly Hospital is at preferred bidder stage and it is expected that the invitation to tender (ITT) for Tallaght Hospital will issue in the near future.</P>
        <P>In 2007 the HSE commissioned an independent review of acute bed capacity requirements for Ireland until the year 2020.  The report produced reaffirms the case for continuing to increase our focus on a primary and community care model.  The review recommended that Ireland develop an Integrated Model of Care system.  This overall strategic direction has already been adopted by other developed countries, such as Denmark and Canada.  The review forms a basis for discussion with key stakeholders on how best to plan for the provision of public health care to 2020.</P>
        <P>A number of measures are being taken in the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government to reform the use of beds in hospitals to ensure equity of access.  In addition to increasing the number of acute hospital beds and looking at the optimum configuration of hospital and community services, other measures being undertaken include the negotiation of a new hospital consultant contract and recruitment of additional hospital consultants.  Hospital consultants have voted to accept the new contractual arrangements, with members of both the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation voting in favour of the new arrangements.</P>
        <P>The major changes in working arrangements under the new contract include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />A longer working week (from 33 to 37 hours);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />An extended working day (8 am to 8 pm Monday to Friday);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Weekend working (up to 5 hours scheduled attendance, where required, on Saturday, Sunday and Bank Holidays);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Team working under leadership of Clinical Directors; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Restrictions on private practice rights and robust measurement of individual consultant&rsquo;s clinical throughput, to ensure that the ratio of private to public work is not exceeded.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These arrangements will result in the increased availability of senior clinical decision makers to treat and discharge patients as part of the transition to a consultant-delivered service, from the present consultant-led service.  The new private practice provisions, ranging from a total prohibition to an upper limit of 20% of overall clinical throughput, depending on the contract type, are designed to improve the position of public patients in terms of their access to the public health system.  The new contract has a target implementation date of 1st September 2008.</P>
        <P>In April 2008 the Health Service Executive recommenced the recruitment process for new consultants in a range of specialties and 129 posts have been advertised to date.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202, 203 and 222 together.</P>
        <P>I identified the need to improve services for persons with cystic fibrosis as a priority in the Estimates process over recent years.  Since 2006, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.78m has been allocated to the HSE to develop services for patients with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that 44 additional staff dealing with cystic fibrosis have been appointed to date across a number of hospitals, including St. Vincent&rsquo;s, Beaumont, Temple Street, Crumlin, Tallaght, Cork University Hospital, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  The necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.</P>
        <P>I asked the HSE to place a particular focus on the development of services at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, the National Adult Tertiary Centre for the treatment of persons with cystic fibrosis, where concerns had been raised regarding the need to improve facilities.  A number of capital projects have been completed at the hospital and further developments are in progress.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, a new ward block is to be built at St. Vincent&rsquo;s which will include 120 replacement beds in single en-suite accommodation.  The new facility will accommodate cystic fibrosis patients and will include appropriate isolation facilities.  The HSE advises that planning permission has been obtained, financial provision has been included in the HSE Capital Plan and the contract is to be awarded in 2008.  It will be a condition of the contract that the design build period be no more than 24 months from the date of contract award.</P>
        <P>In the interim, work is under way on the refurbishment of accommodation to provide eight single en-suite rooms for patients with cystic fibrosis.  The HSE expects that these beds will be operational within the next few weeks.  On completion of this first phase, work will commence to further increase the number of single rooms for patients with cystic fibrosis.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which will invest &euro;575 million over 5 years.</P>
        <P>I understand from enquiries made that a miscalculation occurred when calculating the transitional and subvention funding for 2008 for the Group in question under the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme.  Pobal, who manage the day-to-day operation of the childcare programmes, has since clarified that the rate of staffing funding for the Group in 2007 under the EOCP was &euro;175,788.  Therefore the Group has been approved an increase to their transitional funding for January to June 2008 to &euro;87,894 with their subvention funding for July to December 2008 subsequently increased to &euro;79,105.  The amount of their staffing funding for July to December 2008 represents 90% of their transitional amount as their parent declaration forms did not exceed the floor my predecessor set for the Scheme.  The Group has been notified of their amended funding levels.  This Group was approved a total of &euro;920,219 in EOCP staffing grant assistance.</P>

	<P>The Mental Health Act 2001 provides a modern framework within which people who have a mental disorder and require treatment or protection can be cared for and treated.  It puts in place mechanisms by which the standards, care and treatment in mental health services can be monitored, inspected and regulated and brings Irish mental health law into compliance with international conventions, including the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. </P><Col N="196"/>
        <P>Prior to the full commencement of the Act, the health services embarked on a readiness programme.  A National Project Team was established which included Consultant Psychiatrists, Senior Nursing, Psychology, ICT, Service User, Administrative staff  and senior  managers.  The National Project Team was supported by a Liaison Team.  In addition a network of local implementation groups was formed to raise issues for guidance and clarification. The National Project Team worked closely with the Department of Health &amp; Children, the Mental Health Commission, Service Users organisations, Professional bodies and staff representatives.  5,300 staff employed in the Mental Health Service participated in a 2-day Mental Health Act training programme over a 9-month period.  This equated to 29 training years, rolled out in less than 12 months.</P>
        <P>In these circumstances I am satisfied that Mental Health staff within the HSE are familiar with the rights and responsibilities that flow from human rights standards in the context of the delivery of mental health services.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 231, 232, 335 and 337 together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to the development of a freely available and personalised national programme to provide for the prevention and early detection of illnesses for both men and women.  The Programme intends that guidelines should be developed for the Personal Health Check based on best available national and international evidence of what works well, with structured call and recall arrangements during a person&rsquo;s life and provision for appropriate clinical follow-up where required.</P>
        <P>My Department is at present examining a range of issues which need to be addressed in order to decide how best to proceed in relation to this commitment, in the context of international best practice, our own national health policy and the many competing priorities for heath service development.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.</P>
        <P>In recent years there have been significant improvements to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed.  Since the beginning of 2005, the qualification guidelines have increased by a cumulative 29% (7.5% and 20% in January and October 2005 respectively).  Assessment is now based on a person&rsquo;s and, where relevant, his/her spouse&rsquo;s <Col N="200"/>income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.</P>
        <P>In June 2006, there was a further increase in the qualification threshold for the GP visit card to 50% above that for a medical card (previously 25%).  Furthermore, under the assessment guidelines, persons whose weekly incomes are derived solely from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE payments, even if these exceed the stated threshold, qualify for a medical card.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commits to the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Indexing the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Doubling of the income limit eligibility of parents of children under 6 years of age, and trebling them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In conjunction with the development of a new legislative framework to provide for clear statutory provisions on eligibility for health and personal social services, my Department is reviewing the assessment criteria in the context of financial, medical and social need in line with the commitment in Towards 2016.  A Steering Group has been established which is expected to complete this work in autumn 2008.  It is my intention to then consider how best to progress the commitments in the Programme for Government in relation to medical card eligibility.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 237 to 239, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I established a Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance in January last year.  The overall objective of the Commission is to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure the quality and safety of care for patients is paramount within the health care system.  The Commission has been asked to develop proposals for ensuring clear responsibility among senior management and clinical leaders within the health system for performance in relation to quality and patient safety.  In addition, one of its terms of reference is to specifically examine and make recommendations in relation to a statutory system of licensing for public and private health care providers and services.</P>
        <P>Membership of the Commission is made up of medical and nursing representatives, management representatives and representatives of patients and carers.  The Commission is due to report on its proposals by the end of this month.</P>
        <P>As part of the process involved in considering the proposals of the Commission, a legislative review of the area of patient safety and quality will be undertaken to establish what changes may be necessary to give effect to the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations.  The Commission is also examining and making recommendations on the participation of patients and carers and support staff in engaging with health care providers on health services planning and the quality of care received.  In line with this engagement with patients and carers I intend to ensure that the safety of patients and the delivery of high quality in healthcare services will be at the forefront of any legislative change.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 and 243 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) reports that GP out-of-hours services dealt with some 830,000 calls in 2007 compared with 750,000 calls in 2006, which represents a growth of 11% over 12 months.  The Executive also reports that 90% of the population is now covered by an out-of-hours GP service, compared to 80% in 2006.  This growth was mainly due to the full roll out of the North Dublin GP out-of-hours service (D-DOC), which was introduced in 2006 and became fully operational in early 2007.</P>
        <P>I welcome the continuing development of GP out-of-hours services throughout the country as it is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care and ensuring that, to the greatest extent possible, peoples&rsquo; care needs are met in the primary care setting.  Ongoing annual funding of &euro;37 million is available to the HSE to fund the operation of GP out-of-hours services.  This figure does not include the fees paid to the participating doctors.</P>
        <P>Participation by GPs in an out-of-hours co-operative is voluntary.  The geographic areas to be covered by GP co-operatives and any expansion of same are decisions for the HSE to make having regard to the strategic, financial and other issues involved, including the willingness of GPs in a particular area to join a co-operative arrangement.  My Department will continue to work with the Executive to implement the commitment in the Programme for Government to a &ldquo;within one hour&rdquo; service where this is currently not being achieved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242, 244 and 245 together.</P>
        <P>The key objective of the Primary Care Strategy is to give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational thera<Col N="203"/>pists, home helps and others.  Membership of primary care teams and networks are drawn from existing professional and other staff working in primary, continuing and community care services.  The Government has committed under the Towards 2016 Agreement to the establishment of 300 Primary Care Teams by 2008; 400 by 2009 and 500 by 2011.  In line with the Agreement, a review of these targets is currently under way.</P>
        <P>There have been substantial enhancements in the services provided in primary and community care settings along with corresponding increases in the numbers of staff concerned.  At this stage, the main focus needs to be on the reorganisation of existing services and staff into primary care teams and networks.  This requires changes in work practices and reporting relationships, with an emphasis on joint working by various health professionals.  It also requires significant work in mapping and profiling of areas.  Work under many of these headings is well advanced and I am pleased with the level of interest in, and engagement with, primary care teams among general practitioners.  I understand that some 500 GPs are involved in the development of teams, with a further 700 projected to become involved.</P>
        <P>Specific additional funding was provided each year between 2006 and 2008 to facilitate the roll-out of extra primary care teams. Some of this funding was used to appoint extra frontline professional staff.  The HSE has advised me that it was unable to use the remaining funding as planned because it had to cover higher than anticipated costs in other parts of its services, particularly in acute hospitals, within its overall budget allocation.  Clearly, the HSE has to operate within the resources made available to it in any given year.  However, this should not mean that new funding provided by the Government for specific service enhancements is redirected to other purposes.  I have emphasised to the HSE the importance I attach to the continued development and roll-out of primary care teams.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 to 250, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Under the Programme for Government, the Government is committed to providing an additional 1,500 public acute hospital beds. The co-location initiative aims to deliver approximately 1,000 of these beds for public patients through the development of private hospitals on public sites.</P>
        <P>The essential idea underlying the co-location initiative is to free up capacity for public patients and deliver new public acute beds in the quickest and most efficient manner. The initiative was founded on the principle that all patients ordinarily resident in the State should have access to public hospitals based on medical need; the possession of private health insurance should not influence timeliness of access or treatment. A diversity of providers of hospital care is commonplace in many countries and is entirely appropriate.</P>
        <P>The scheme of capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private hospitals was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and came into effect in May 2002. Provided that capital expenditure on the proposed co-located private hospitals conforms with the existing legislation governing that scheme, normal tax relief will apply. Under the terms of the Finance Act 2001, the co-located hospital must ensure that at least 20% of its bed capacity be made available to the HSE for the treatment of individuals awaiting in-patient or outpatient hospital services as public patients. The fees charged must be not be more than 90% of the fees that would be charged for equivalent treatment provided to a patient with private medical insurance.</P>
        <P>The new privately-managed facilities will be available for public patients and will supplement rather than supplant public service provision. In principle, all such hospital capacity that meets standards and offers value for money should be capable of being used for all patients.</P>
        <P>The Government endorsed the co-location initiative in July 2005. The policy direction I subsequently issued to the HSE required the Executive to undertake a rigorous value for money assessment of co-location proposals which would take account of the value of the public site and the cost of the tax forgone. The HSE had to satisfy itself that proposals represented better value for money than building, commissioning and operating beds in the traditional manner. Projects in order to proceed must meet a rigorous value for money test which accords with a Public Sector Benchmark applied by the HSE in the first instance, which is verified by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) which acts as advisor to the Department of Health and Children. The HSE and NDFA calculations went through all aspects of each project in great detail, including such matters as site value, capital allowances cost, value of released beds and loss of private income to public hospitals. The HSE and NDFA have confirmed that the tenders received for the six most advanced projects provide value for money and the projects must continue to demonstrate value for money as they proceed.</P>
        <P>Detailed and innovative features will promote the public interest. Each site will have one accident and emergency department. The private hospitals will facilitate medical training and research and development; accept direct admissions to medical and surgical admission units from primary care centres and general practitioners on a 24-hour basis; comply with physical design requirements to fit with the public hospital; have joint clinical governance, shared infor<Col N="205"/>mation and records management, performance management and documented service level agreements, where these are undertaken; and participate in the public HIPE and casemix information systems.</P>
        <P>The Board of the Health Service Executive (HSE) has approved preferred bidders for six co-located hospital sites: Beaumont Hospital, Cork University Hospital, Limerick Regional Hospital, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Waterford Regional Hospital, Sligo General Hospital.</P>
        <P>The Project Agreements for Limerick Regional Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and Cork University Hospital have been signed. Planning permission has been granted by the local authorities concerned for the co-located hospitals at Beaumont and at Cork University Hospital  Planning permission for the Beaumont and Cork projects has been appealed to an Bord Plean&aacute;la. The HSE has advised my Department that a decision to grant planning permission for the Limerick Regional Hospital project was given in mid June and that this decision is scheduled to be made final later this month subject to no planning appeal being lodged.</P>
        <P>The HSE advises that the Project Agreements for St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital are expected to be signed shortly.  The HSE expects the Sligo Project Agreement to be concluded by the autumn.</P>
        <P>Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, which are also participating in the co-location initiative, are at an earlier stage of the procurement process.  Connolly Hospital is at preferred bidder stage and it is expected that the invitation to tender (ITT) for Tallaght Hospital will issue in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to carry out an independent review of the co location initiative following completion of the current programme. In accordance with this commitment, my Department will make the necessary arrangements to commission such a review in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 to 255, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Improving the delivery of Accident and Emergency services continues to be a high priority for this Government.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government contains a number of commitments designed to further improve the delivery of Accident &amp; Emergency services.  These are to:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Increase the number of A &amp; E consultants available around the clock in A &amp; E departments;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Further develop chest pain and respiratory clinics to ease pressure on A &amp; E;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Establish a national network of Local Injury Clinics.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The &ldquo;100 + Scheme&rdquo; was introduced last year by the HSE to reward hospitals with Emergency Departments operating in line with performance targets.  Phase 1 of the Scheme involved the announcement in August 2007 of 60 consultant posts to be distributed across 24 hospitals and including posts in emergency medicine, radiology, general medicine, general surgery and geriatric medicine. The HSE National Service Plan, 2008 states that these posts will be progressed in line with the level of development funding available for the scheme.</P>
        <P>An additional 20 Consultants in Emergency Medicine have been approved to support the delivery of A &amp; E services since 2003. This represents an increase of 61% over the past five years in emergency consultant numbers. A further 2 posts were advertised in April.</P>
        <P>In addition, the new Consultant Contract provides for greater flexibility in the rostering of Consultants in Emergency Medicine and the consequent availability of consultant-provided services in line with clinical need. The new Contract includes provision for an extended working day to 12 hours Monday to Friday (8 am to 8 pm), provision for rostering on-site at weekends and public holidays and by agreement, more flexible arrangements, including 24/7 rostering.</P>
        <P>Chest pain assessment and respiratory services are provided at existing Emergency Departments. There are also dedicated practice examples where GP referrals are assessed by the cardiology services in units with chest pain assessment units such as the Mater, Connolly, Cork University and South Infirmary Hospitals. Dedicated respiratory clinics are conducted at hospitals such as the Mater Hospital and Connolly.</P>
        <P>Significant capital provision has been included by the HSE within its Draft Capital Plan 2008-2013 for the enhancement of A &amp; E facilities in line with the recommendations of the <Col N="207"/>Emergency Task Force. The funding will be targeted at upgrading and extending existing departments and will also include provision for new departments. A number of the new A&amp;E Departments have provision for minor injury clinics at hospitals  including Connolly,   Cork University, St Vincent&rsquo;s, St James&rsquo;s and South Tipperary General Hospitals.</P>
        <P>Outside of Dublin, funding was provided for the expansion of the  minor injury service at St. John&rsquo;s Limerick, and the provision of a minor injuries unit at Waterford Regional Hospital.  These services are fully operational.</P>
        <P>In line with the recommendations of the Teamwork Report &ldquo;Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards&rdquo;, the HSE is also committed to the development of Minor Injury Units in local hospitals in the North East. The first of these units is to be developed at Monaghan Hospital. Other units are to open at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan and Louth County Hospital, Dundalk.</P>
        <P>My Department has asked the HSE to communicate directly to the Deputy any additional detail regarding initiatives at individual hospital level in respect of the issues raised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256 to 260, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Tackling all Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) continues to be a priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>The HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic <Col N="208"/>consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.</P>
        <P>In order to introduce measures to aid in the reduction of antibiotic prescribing, additional antibiotic liaison infectious disease pharmacists have been appointed in order to assist with the participation in the national surveillance of antibiotic consumption.  The development of guidance in relation to the appropriate use of antimicrobials has also commenced.  Local prescribing guidelines are in place in 67% of acute hospitals and antibiotic audits have been carried out in 40% of hospitals.  Education campaigns for healthcare staff and the general public around the prudent use of antibiotics have commenced.  It is hoped to commence a public information campaign on prudent antibiotic use to accompany GP educational programmes by the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>The availability of isolation facilities is another important factor in the overall solution to the issue of reducing incidence of infection.  I have instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used for isolation purposes where required for patients who contract HCAIs and this policy has been adopted by the HSE.   New environmental building guidelines to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments are expected to be published by the HSE later this month.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertook a comprehensive review of hygiene in our acute hospitals in 2007 and published its report last November.  The hygiene review process included unannounced visits by HIQA.  The report represents a thorough assessment of how hygiene services are provided and managed in 51 HSE-funded acute care hospitals.  This allows individual hospitals identify strengths and areas for improvement.  HIQA is following up on this review to ensure that deficits identified during that process are rectified and the Authority will be undertaking a further national review this Autumn.  In addition, on 3rd June HIQA published its &lsquo;Draft Infection Prevention and Control Standards: A Consultation Document&rsquo;.  When finalised, these, along with the National Hygiene Standards, will provide a comprehensive framework to control infection in all healthcare settings and the HSE will produce a further Action Plan around these standards.</P>
        <P>In relation to financial incentives for achieving excellence, while it is a matter for the Health Service Executive to decide on funding priorities, I favour, of course, the allocation by the Executive of resources to best ensure the delivery of high quality services.</P>
        <P>I expect to receive the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance in July which will have proposals on, amongst other matters, licensing of healthcare facilities and services.  It will be appreciated that I am not in a position to comment on the report until I receive its recommendations.</P>
        <P>While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261, 275, 277, 279, 280, 282, 284 and 344 together.</P>
        <P>The development of Services for Older People is a priority for the Government. Our aim is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care. This is reflected in the funding committed to services for older people in recent Budgets and the ongoing progression of the commitments in the Programme for Government to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
        <P>For example, over &euro;400m additional funding was provided in Budgets 2006 and 2007, of which &euro;190m was ear-marked for a wide range of community based initiatives such as Home Care Packages, Home Helps, Meals on Wheels and Day /Respite Care services. At the end of 2007 the HSE provided approximately:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />11.8 million Home Help hours benefitting around 53,000 clients;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Over 4,000 Home Care Packages assisting some 10,500 clients;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Over 21,000 Day Care and Respite places.</P><Col N="210"/>
        <P FLI="0"> In relation to Palliative Care Services and the issue of regional disparities, the HSE is developing a national 5 year Implementation Framework, which is due to be finalised shortly.  This will prioritise palliative care developments nationally over this period and will inform any future allocation of development funds. It will also be reflected in the HSE National Service Plan each year.  The National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care Report (2001) highlighted amongst other things, the special and specific needs of children with life limiting conditions.  In 2007 the Department of Health and Children set up a Working Group to develop a policy on children&rsquo;s palliative care in line with the 2001 Report. The draft policy document of the Group is currently being finalised.</P>
        <P>On the issue of  diverted funding for Palliative Care the HSE have committed through the National Service Plan 2008 to delivering services within its Vote provided by the Oireachtas.  There is no doubt that demand can at times exceed service resources and that this problem can manifest itself in particular at local level. It is a matter for the HSE to deliver services both nationally and locally within its budget and overall health policy priorities.  However, this should not mean that new funding provided by the Government for specific service enhancements can be, as a routine budget practice, redirected to other purposes.  This Government has provided an additional &euro;2million in budget 2008 for organisations that work in partnership with the HSE to deliver services but this is now contingent on the HSE delivering overall services within its voted allocation for 2008.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commitment to the expansion of Nursing Home Inspections is being progressed by the HSE&rsquo;s implementation of a standardised nationwide inspections process. HSE implements a standardised nationwide inspections process with a target of 2 inspections per home per year. Over 870 Nursing Home inspections (2 inspections per Nursing Home) were carried out in 2006.  HSE confirms it completed 812 statutory inspections in 2007 (93% of its target), with the remainder completed in January 2008.  An extra &euro;6m was allocated for the further development of this process in 2006-2007.</P>
        <P>The proposal  to provide ten new 50 bed Community Nursing Units in the next five years is being progressed in the context of the National Development Plan.  The capital and revenue implications arising from individual projects proposals fall to be reviewed each year in the context of agreeing the annual Estimates process and the Service/Capital Plans for the HSE. The public fast-track bed initiative currently underway provides for 860 new public beds. This process commenced in 2007 and will continue throughout 2008 and 2009.</P>
        <P>The supports for minimising social exclusion among older people relates to a wide range of measures in the NDP including for example the Social Inclusion, Social Infrastructure and Human Capital Chapters.  The key initiatives insofar as my Department is concerned relates to the Living at Home Sub Programme which provides for some &euro;4.7 billion investment over the period of the Plan.</P>
        <P>In relation to the commitment to introduce a community led pilot scheme to counter the social isolation of the elderly in rural Ireland,  this scheme would not fall under the direct remit of my Department.  However, the Plan which gives effect to many of the commitments contained in &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo;,  recognised older people as one of the main groups at risk from social exclusion. Many of the health &mdash; related community based initiatives introduced to-date, or planned for future years underpin this objective.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 263 together.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck commenced roll-out in the Western Region in May 2007 and in the Southern region last October.  I officially opened the BreastCheck clinical static units in Galway and Cork last December.  The expansion of the BreastCheck programme to the Southern region covers counties Limerick, Kerry, Cork, Waterford and Tipperary South Riding.  The expansion of the BreastCheck programme to the West covers counties Clare, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary North Riding.</P>
        <P>An additional &euro;26.7 million capital funding was provided for the construction of  the two new clinical static units, eight additional mobile units and the provision of state of the art digital equipment.  A total of &euro;15 million additional revenue funding has been allocated to cater for national roll-out of the programme.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved and recruitment is underway.</P>
        <P>The expert advice from BreastCheck and from the National Cancer Forum, as contained in the National Strategy for Cancer Control, is that following the national extension of the programme, the upper age limit should be extended to women aged 69 years.  The priority of BreastCheck is to screen women who have not yet been screened and accordingly it is fully focussed at present on the completion of the first round of screening in the West and South.  I will consider extending the age limit as recommended when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered.  Any woman irrespective of her age who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

	<P>It is my objective and that of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to see the earliest delivery of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology (NPRO).  Considerable progress is being made in implementing the Plan which is a key deliverable of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme. Additional revenue funding of &euro;3.25m was allocated in 2007 and a further &euro;5m in 2008 to support delivery of the Plan. An additional 39 posts have also been approved.  Five consultant radiation oncologist posts have already been advertised and a further five oncologist posts will be advertised this year.</P>
        <P>This plan is progressing on schedule with the first phase (new facilities in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont) due for completion in 2010.  Installation of additional capacity at St. Luke&rsquo;s has been completed and will be fully operational in September 2008.  Work is also progressing for the second phase of expansion of radiation therapy facilities nationally which will be procured through a Public Private Partnership (PPP).</P><Col N="212"/>
        <P>The specific question raised by the Deputy in relation to the details of phase two of the process relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department  has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the matters raised.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 418 together.</P>
        <P>The estimated additional cost of the implementation of &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy is &euro;150m over 7 to 10 years.  A total of  &euro;51.2 million has been allocated since 2006 which represents over a third of the overall requirement.  In addition to the extra funding required to finance &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;, existing resources need to be remodelled and reallocated.  It is clear that the implementation of the report is dependent to a much greater extent on the remodelling of existing resources, than on new additional funding.  It is also clear that additional investment must be phased in parallel with the reorganisation of mental health services and resources.  In view of the significant additional investment in 2006 and 2007, it is necessary to pause and review the situation in 2008, to ensure consolidation of the investment to date.</P><Col N="213"/>
        <P>Substantial resources have been invested in mental health services.  Estimated expenditure in 2006 and 2007 was &euro;984 million and &euro;1 billion respectively.  It is also important to bear in mind that some 90% of mental health services are provided at primary care level.  Expenditure on these services is not captured in the above figures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Health and Children has been advised by the HSE that &euro;24 million of the &euro;51.2 million development funding was not used as planned, because of competing expenditure pressures and the overriding obligation on the HSE to live within its overall Vote.  As a result, some of the planned developments in mental health services have been delayed; however, some of the mental health services funded in 2006 and 2007 will be put in place in 2008.  These include the provision of 8 additional child and adolescent mental health  teams, and the provision of 18 additional beds for children and adolescents at St. Anne&rsquo;s, Galway, St. Vincent&rsquo;s, Fairview and St. Stephen&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork,  to increase the bed complement from the current provision of 12 to 30 during 2008.</P>
        <P>Implementation of &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; is a key priority for the recently established Office for Disability and Mental Health.  The Office is working in partnership with the HSE and other stakeholders to achieve implementation of agreed targets.</P>

	<P>A Vision for Change, the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.  The Report recommends inter alia that a plan to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals should be drawn up and implemented, and that the resources released by these closures should be protected for reinvestment in the mental health service.  It is understood that the Health Service Executive (HSE) has disposed of a small number of assets since the launch of the Report in January 2006.  </P>
        <P>As the HSE has primary responsibility for implementing this recommendation, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular issues raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>To qualify as a clinical psychologist, a post-graduate qualification in clinical psychology must be completed after an initial undergraduate degree in psychology.  Post-graduate students are sponsored by health agencies and spend time over three years in clinical placements in different specialties; course work and a thesis must be also satisfactorily completed.</P>
        <P>For some years the Health Service Executive has been committed to developing the number of postgraduate training places for clinical psychology nationally.   In 2003, the total training places available nationally was 54.   At that time, clinical psychology training opportunities were <Col N="214"/>available at UCD and TCD only.  Since then, facilitated through a partnership initiative involving the HSE and four National Universities &mdash; TCD, UCD, UL and NUIG &mdash; the number of clinical psychologists in training has doubled to 110 training places.    Within the HSE,  a Working Group continues to examine the issue of training places and I have been advised that the Executive aims to bring the total number nationally to 150 by the year 2009.</P>

	<P>A Vision for Change &mdash; the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy proposes a holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated multidisciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems.  It recognises that responding to children&rsquo;s mental health needs can be conceptualised at different levels, ranging from early intervention and health promotion programmes, to primary and community care services and specialist mental heath services for the treatment of complex disorders.  Recommendations in the Report are consistent with commitments in the Programme for Government.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Implementation of  A Vision for Change is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  In this regard the HSE has prioritised the development of child and adolescent services in 2008 and has recently advertised 12 Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists posts;  teams to support the consultants are also being advanced.  In addition the HSE propose to increase the in-patient child and adolescent bed capacity from the current number of 12, to 30 by the end of the year. Construction will also begin on two purpose-built 20 bed children&rsquo;s in-patient units in Galway and Cork.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is noted that considerable work in planning the reconfiguration of mental health services for people with an intellectual disability was undertaken in 2007 following the Report of the Forum on Mental Health and Intellectual Disability.  In 2008, each area will be required  to agree the reconfiguration necessary to meet the recommendations in relation to the provision of services for people with Intellectual Disability. As the majority of services for people with intellectual disability is provided by voluntary partners, these arrangements will be agreed and developed jointly with the voluntary partners.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 270 to 274, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In September 2005, Reach Out &mdash; a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, 2005-2014 was launched.  The strategy provides a policy framework for suicide prevention activities in Ireland.  The strategy calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies. The actions identified in this strategy are consistent with the commitments in the Programme for Government.   The HSE, through the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP), oversees the implementation of the strategy and has taken on board the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children regarding the &ldquo;High Levels of Suicide in Irish Society&rdquo; which are consistent with the actions identified in Reach Out.</P>
        <P>One of the key components of the overall strategy aimed at reducing suicide include the implementation of measures aimed at high risk groups, provision of information and training on suicide prevention to relevant professionals and organisations, research on suicide prevention and the improvement of services which would benefit those at risk of suicide and those who attempt suicide.  Suicide prevention rates have been agreed with the National Office for Suicide Prevention &mdash; an interim target for a 10% reduction in suicide is to be achieved by 2010.  In addition, a target of 5% reduction in repeated self- harm by 2010 and a further 5% by 2016 has been set.</P>
        <P>Additional funding of &euro;1.85 million was provided in 2007 for the implementation of the Strategy bringing the overall funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives in 2007 to &euro;8 million and this level of funding continues into 2008.  This funding is being used to develop and implement national training programmes, complete the availability of self-harm services through A&amp;E departments, develop mental health awareness campaigns, implement recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services and support voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention.</P>
        <P>It should also be recognised that a  range of services such as mental health and primary care services are important in helping to prevent suicide. These services play a vital role in the drive to reduce the incidence of suicide and should be taken into account when considering the level of expenditure devoted to suicide prevention.</P>
        <P>The promotion of positive mental health contributes significantly to combating ignorance and stigma which often surrounds mental illness.  In 2007, two national mental health awareness campaigns were launched.  In October 2007, the HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention&rsquo;s Mental Health Awareness Campaign &lsquo;Your Mental Health&rsquo; was launched.  The main aim of this campaign is to influence public attitudes to mental health and is specifically designed to alter negative attitudes and to promote positive attitudes and a greater understanding of mental <Col N="216"/>health.  In addition, in December 2007, the National Disability Authority launched an advertising campaign &lsquo;Challenging Attitudes to Mental Health&rsquo;, which is designed to challenge negative perceptions about people with mental health problems.</P>
        <P>The NOSP Annual Report includes details on initiatives and statistics etc. including research activities funded.</P>

	<P>A key Government initiative in the area of rehabilitation is the commitment by the Department of Health &amp; Children and the HSE to develop a national strategy for the provision of medical rehabilitation services. A number of issues will be considered as part of this including an assessment of the need, the structure and location of facilities and services, the nature of the rehabilitation facilities, that is, whether they should be hospital type, step down, or preparation for independent living.  I am happy to say that preliminary meetings in relation to this strategy will take place in the coming weeks. </P>
        <P>The commitment to provide funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund to secure rehabilitation services would have to be considered in the context of the strategy.</P>
        <P>With regard to long-term care, I would like to take this opportunity to clarify the position. Under the proposed new Nursing Home Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, the NTPF will have responsibility for agreeing prices for long-term residential care with private nursing home owners for the purposes of the scheme.  However, HSE will remain the budget-holders for the scheme.</P>

The National Audit of Stroke Care which was recently published by the Irish Heart Foundation with the support of my Department, has highlighted a number of areas where clinical care and the organisation of stroke services can be enhanced.</P>
        <P>The policy group is considering the audit and is addressing the issues including prevention in the primary care setting, rapid access to diagnostic services, the configuration of stroke <Col N="217"/>services including stroke units, the provision of thrombolysis as well as models of rehabilitation and discharge planning. The group is expected to report before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has indicated that there are now acute stroke units in six hospitals, namely Mater Misericordiae Hospital, St James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin; South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel; Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan; Sligo General Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital, Galway. A further two hospitals, St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Kilkenny and Connolly Hospital, Dublin are building or refurbishing a unit.

	<P>The present standards for nursing homes are set out in the 1993 Care and Welfare Regulations and the HSE inspects private nursing homes on the basis of these standards.</P>
        <P>In January 2007, Minister Harney published Draft National Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People.  The standards were developed by a working group chaired by DoHC and included the Health Service Executive, Social Service Inspectorate and the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board. Once introduced, these standards will apply to all nursing homes, be they public, private and voluntary.</P>
        <P>As the Health Act, 2007 provides that the enhanced inspection function will be taken over by the Health Information and Quality Authority, the draft standards were formally referred to HIQA for consultation and finalisation.  The Authority established a wide-ranging Working Group to finalise the draft standards. On the 25th February, 2008 the Board of the Authority approved their draft National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People and submitted them for the approval of the Minister for Health and Children, as required under section 10(2) of the Health Act, 2007.</P>
        <P>The draft Standards and the Regulations required to underpin them will be subject to a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) before finalisation.  The RIA process has commenced and it is intended to have both the approved Standards and Regulations in place in early 2009.</P>

        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, intends to publish the Bill as soon as possible following finalisation by the Attorney General and Government approval, and to bring the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas thereafter. As the timeframe for bringing <Col N="218"/>the legislation through both Houses is contingent upon finalisation of the Bill, a more definitive answer is not possible at this stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 372 together.</P>
        <P>The HSE is making progress in the integration of a large number of health sector agencies, in setting and implementing consistent performance standards, and in improving patient care across many different service areas.</P>
        <P>The HSE endeavours to make constant and continuous improvement.  To this end, I meet with the Chairman and CEO of the Executive regularly.</P>
        <P>In this context, I wrote to the Chairman of the HSE last March, on foot of the report into the handling of events at Portlaoise. I asked him to consider whether the governance and management issues which had been identified in relation to the events at Portlaoise had wider application across the HSE. I acknowledged that the Board had already been considering these issues and I asked for this work to be expedited.</P>
        <P>The Chairman wrote to me about these wider governance and management issues on 27 May and outlined for me the key elements of a proposed new management structure. In summary, this will involve:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a Director of Service Delivery who would be responsible for all service delivery and head up a single integrated NHO/PCCC pillar with a team of Area Service Delivery Personnel;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a Director of Planning with a team of national care group/programme managers covering children, older people, disability/mental health, acute hospitals and primary/community care who would be responsible for setting corporate policy/standards in all these areas and driving performance against these standards;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a Director of Clinical Affairs who would drive engagement with clinicians and be responsible for quality/risk, and defining national clinical standards/protocols;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a Director of Communications who would be responsible for all communications including parliamentary affairs;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />and the retention of the existing Directors of Finance, HR, ICT, Estates and Procurement.</P><Col N="219"/>
        <P FLI="0">The Chairman explained that these changes are designed to:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />maximise operational excellence and effectiveness in service delivery;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />facilitate integrated service delivery for the benefit of patients and to optimise efficient use of resources;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />enable a single national strategic approach with local (area) responsibility for service delivery;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />ensure clinical engagement at all levels; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />create a lean organisation with clarity of roles and accountability.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The implementation of these new management structures will necessitate a clarification of associated staffing implications below National Director.  In line with the Government&rsquo;s decision today, this will include developing a voluntary redundancy scheme to streamline the number of management layers and positions.  This scheme will be subject to consultation, will require the prior approval of the Minister for Finance and will operate on a voluntary basis.  It is to meet the test of delivering value for money.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the new structure is to make operational decision-making clearer and more efficient.  It will allow those charged with service delivery to take a far more active role in delivering services within budget and staffing limits. National strategies will remain at national level.</P>
        <P>I am committed to the review of the Health Service Executive as set out in the Programme for Government and to ensuring that staff will have an opportunity to propose ways in which the HSE can work more effectively.  To this end, I expect the Executive will:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />focus intensely on implementation and service delivery, with clear lines of management accountability internally, and a concentration on short-term deliverable changes which are consistent with overall policy;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />develop a locally responsive system of service delivery within a consistent national framework;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />have an integrated and patient-centred approach to service delivery, by enhanced team working internally and with care groups, professions, etc.;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />strengthen its communications with the Oireachtas; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />strengthen its communications with staff, the general public and the media.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The further development of the nursing profession has been progressed in several different ways under this Government.</P>
        <P>The 2007-2012 Programme for Government&rsquo;s commitment to further the development of the nursing profession sought to increase both the status of nurses and midwives and the number <Col N="220"/>of nursing and midwifery posts. It also gave a commitment to keeping the Benchmarking process open to nurses.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2006 there were 36,737 whole time equivalent nurses/midwives employed and this increased to 37,850 by March of this year. In addition to increasing the overall number of nurses it must also be acknowledged that nurses are beginning to work at a high level of specialist practice e.g. in Intensive Care, Cardiac and Bone Marrow Transplants units.</P>
        <P>There are 113 Advanced Nurse Practitioners and 1,979 Clinical Nurse Specialists currently in place.  These posts are created to meet specific service needs, are spread across the country and across the nursing disciplines and these type of posts are continuously being developed.</P>
        <P>The development and modernisation of the nursing profession requires a new legislative framework for nurses and midwives from that set out in the Nurses Act 1985. My Department is currently preparing new legislation in this regard. This proposed legislation will provide a modern framework for the regulation of the professions and the practices of nursing and midwifery and for greater protection of the public. An extensive public consultation process on Heads of Proposed Nurses and Midwives Bill has recently been completed. The development of this new legislation is well advanced and it is planned that it will be in place next year.</P>
        <P>In line with last year&rsquo;s recommendations of the National Implementation Body (NIB) I have established a Commission to produce an independent assessment of how a 35 hour week for nurses and midwives can be achieved having regard to the issues set out in Labour Court Recommendation No. 18763.  It began its work in March 2008 and it plans to submit its report at the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The Commission is examining the international experience of best practice in the activities and deployment of nurses and midwives, and the type of flexibilities and change which would be necessary to achieve a 35 hour week. The Commission will take account of the submissions from the HSE management, based on the analysis it is initiating, and the nursing unions who should elaborate to the Commission on the changes they believe would facilitate the 35 hour week.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, management and unions are working to introduce a 37.5 hour week for nurses on a cost neutral basis and without diminution of services to patients as also provided in the NIB statement last year. This entails a more efficient use of the nursing resource and it is being introduced on a site by site basis. To date the reduced working week has been introduced in sites covering 14,275 nurses and midwives (approximately 38% of the total).</P>
        <P>The commitment to keeping the Benchmarking process open to nurses was honoured. Nursing issues were considered and addressed by the Benchmarking Body last year and included in its report dated December 2007.</P>
        <P>I have amended the relevant legislation and introduced new regulations to allow for the introduction of nurse prescribing.  By the end of 2008 there will be approximately 150 nurses and midwives who will have completed the nurse prescribing education programme and will be available to prescribe medications in areas such as Accident and Emergency Departments, cardiology, maternity services and other specialist care areas such as diabetes, respiratory and sexual health to name a few. These programmes are conducted in University College Cork and the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland and commenced in April 2007.</P>
        <P>There are currently 13 nurses in the service who are prescribing medications. I have always believed that the expansion of nursing practice into prescribing could benefit the full spectrum of health services.  The extension of prescriptive authority to nurses and midwives can improve quality of life for patients, especially in areas such as care of the older person, chronic disease, <Col N="221"/>palliative care, maternity services and many more.  Health service delays will be reduced for patients and nurses and midwives will be able to use their time more effectively to give the right care at the right time in the right setting.</P>
        <P>Last year I also introduced the necessary regulation to enable nurses who meet the standards and requirements set down by An Bord Altranais to refer patients for x-rays. The introduction of nurse x-ray prescribing will give authority to enable nurses and midwives to refer patients for an agreed range of x-rays which will be undertaken within their scope of practice. This will enable nurses to develop and use their education, skills and knowledge to maximise their contribution to patient care and at the same time achieve the highest levels of professional judgement.</P>
        <P>The Requirements and Standards for Education Programmes to enable Nurses prescribe x-rays have been approved by An Bord Altranais. I understand that the HSE has commenced the process of implementation for nurses to undertake this expanded practice starting with establishing the required educational programmes.</P>
        <P>A good example of the development of nursing services is in the sensitive area of providing a service to the victims of sexual assault.  Nurses are well placed to conduct forensic examinations on victims of assault and following a recent review of the Sexual Assault Treatment Services in Ireland nurses are currently undertaking forensic training to provide this service. Eight nurses commenced an education programme in January 2008 to enable them to carry out this service.</P>
        <P>In 2002 the first phase of the 4 year nursing degree was introduced and this was finalised by the introduction of midwifery and integrated children&rsquo;s/general nursing degree programme in 2006.  There is now an annual intake of 1,880 student nurses and midwives into this programme.</P>
        <P>The establishment of management and clinical career pathways for nurses and midwives has heralded the development of post-registration nursing and midwifery education programmes throughout the country.  There exists a comprehensive programme of post-registration education which is widely availed of.  A total of 286 nursing and midwifery specific post-registration courses were offered by 14 higher education institutes in the Autumn of 2006 and Spring 2007.   The HSE has recently completed a review of all nursing and midwifery post-registration education programmes. The recommendations of this review will provide a comprehensive strategic framework for the future development and delivery of nursing and midwifery post-registration education in Ireland.</P>
        <P>A pilot Post Registration Psychiatric nursing programme for registered nurses wishing to become psychiatric nurses commenced in February of this year.  Interest for places on this programme was high. A total of 46 students are currently engaged in this one-year post registration psychiatric programme in Dublin City University and have signed service commitments to work in their sponsoring mental health services including the Voluntary Services in Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow for a further two year period following successful completion of the programme.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that the Government has provided significant funding in recent years for the education and development of the nursing profession and funding has also been provided for the up-skilling of support staff who work with nurses and midwives.  I believe that there is significant potential for the continued development of the nursing profession and the more efficient use of the nursing resource.</P>
        <P>My Department and the HSE are committed to the expansion of the role of nurses and midwives so as to empower them to work in new ways, make better use of their skills and knowledge so as to provide an enhanced service for patients and clients.</P>

	<P>Under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme general practitioners hold one of two contract types, i.e. the Fee per Item contract (first introduced in 1972) or the Capitation contract (effective from 1989).  These contracts reflect the agreed outcome of negotiations between my Department and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation.  Both contract types contain provisions relating to the  retirement age.  The Capitation contract  provides that GPs who entered into contracts on the date of its commencement could hold the contract up to age 70 and that all subsequent GP contractors could hold the contract up to age 65.  The Fee per Item contract terminates upon the GP reaching 70 years of age. </P>
        <P>In the context of a review of the contractual arrangements for the provision of services under the GMS Scheme and other publicly funded schemes, I have asked my Department, in conjunction with the HSE, to examine provisions relating to the age at which GPs must cease to hold contracts.</P>

        <P FLI="0">A national therapy project office has been set up by the HSE to oversee the recruitment of competent staff in line with the HSE Transformation Programme and HSE Corporate policy.  A national recruitment process has been organised in 2008 for staff grade therapists in Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy and Speech and Language Therapy.</P>
        <P>The aim of this national recruitment process is to ensure that panels of therapists are available to take up positions as they become available. Panels of Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapy and Speech and Language Therapists are now in place.</P><Col N="224"/>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the commencement of the planned developments in disability services this year had been delayed due to a financial review in the HSE.  However, I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the HSE has assured me that it is now in a position to roll out the planned developments as outlined in its 2008 Service Plan.</P>
        <P>Planned services include additional residential, day care &mdash; including training places &mdash; and respite care places for people with intellectual disability and autism; additional residential care and home support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities; and additional multi-disciplinary therapy posts to provide assessment and ongoing intervention services to children with a disability.</P>

	<P>Significant progress has been made in relation to the commitment through implementation of the recommendations contained in the market reports of the Competition Authority, the Health Insurance Authority and the Barrington Group that the Government decided would be appropriate to implement.  Matters addressed include the removal of the 3 year exemption from risk equalisation, enactment of VHI legislation, development of the Health Insurance Authority&rsquo;s campaigns on consumer information and its agreement with the insurers concerning information notices to be included with annual renewals. In addition the Authority is currently examining the question of the level of cover to which community rating should apply and is also giving consideration to the recommendation on moving to a prospective form of risk equalisation.</P>
        <P>Enactment and commencement of the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2008 also addresses a number of issues considered in the three reports. Inter alia, the Act provides for the removal of the obligation on the VHI to submit products and proposed premia increases to the Minister for approval and it obliges the VHI to apply to the Financial Regulator for authorisation.</P>
        <P>As I outlined to the Joint Committee recently consultations have taken place with the insurers on draft Lifetime Community Rating Regulations that had been prepared. Related amendments to the Open Enrolment Regulations are also envisaged. I would hope to submit these Regulations to the Houses for affirmation in the Autumn. The Deputy will appreciate that these and any other amendments to the framework that may be considered appropriate must await delivery of the Supreme Court judgement in BUPA&rsquo;s appeal against the High Court judgement that upheld the regulatory framework. Since that judgement, the Court of First Instance earlier this year affirmed the EU Commission&rsquo;s positive assessment of May 2003 that recognised risk equalisation as a necessary and proportionate support to community rating.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Health Service Executive has established a Working Group to implement the recommendations of the Report of the National Taskforce on Obesity, for which it has the lead responsibility. A sum of &euro;3 million was allocated for this purpose in 2006. This is in addition to the annual spend of &euro;25 million on health promotion activities, &euro;5 million of which is utilised in anti-obesity initiatives.</P>
        <P>My Department and the HSE have been introducing actions and policies which will help to stem the rise in obesity rates.</P>
        <P>The National Nutrition Policy, which will be completed later this year, will further assist with the implementation of the Obesity Task Force Report.  My Department and the Department of Education and Science have been involved in developing healthy eating guidelines for schools. Guidelines for pre-schools and primary schools are already developed and appropriate healthy eating training by community dieticians with pre-school and primary school staff is currently underway. Post-primary school guidelines will be launched in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Funding has been provided by the HSE to UCD to record height and weight in children at school entry point as part of the Lifeways cohort. The HSE is currently working on a national database to monitor prevalence trends of growth, overweight and obesity.  The HSE is participating in a WHO surveillance initiative to monitor growth and height in a cohort of children which is currently being completed and this will provide some baseline data for the national database.</P>
        <P>The Cardiovascular Health Policy Group, due to report later this year, will also be advising on measures to tackle obesity.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;Little Steps Go A Long Way&rdquo; campaign, which was launched last month, is an all-island campaign led by the HSE, Safefood and the Health Promotion Agency of Northern Ireland. These agencies are working together with a common agenda of raising awareness of the growing problem of obesity and how we might address it. This partnership will support achieving maximum impact from the campaign and value for money for all involved.</P>
        <P>The North-South Ministerial Conference recently agreed to the establishment of an all-island obesity action forum for a three year period.  The forum will be facilitated and supported by Safefood, and will comprise a range of stakeholders including government departments, <Col N="226"/>government agencies, health bodies and professional bodies.  The forum will also include representation from stakeholders with a remit in physical activity to maximise cohesion in addressing obesity related issues.  It is intended to hold an all-island Obesity Conference in Northern Ireland in the autumn of this year.  This is being organised by the HSE and Health Promotion Agency (NI).</P>
        <P>My Department continues to work with a number of Government Departments and agencies to promote healthy lifestyles, viz, the Department of Education on the SPHE programme and other health initiatives, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on alcohol related harms, the Department of Communications on food advertising codes, the Departments of Transport and Environment, Heritage and Local Government on enhancing the built and transport environments to encourage increased physical activity among the population and also the Irish Sports Council on promoting physical activity.  It is planned to channel inter-sectoral work through the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is taking a twin-track approach to tackling alcohol related harm, involving policies and interventions targeted at vulnerable populations and policies targeted at the population at large to reduce the overall level of alcohol misuse in society. </P>
        <P>Strengthened voluntary codes on advertising and sponsorship which were developed between my Department and representatives of the Irish drinks industry and the Irish advertising industry came into effect on 1 July last.  In addition, the Government has asked my Department to commence a process to identify areas in relation to alcohol advertising, promotions and sponsorships where legislative measures might be necessary to afford greater protection to young people.   The Government has also agreed to the establishment of a working group to examine the extent of the existing sponsorships by alcohol companies and the terms and lengths of contracts.  This working group will consider how concerns around the extent of sports sponsorship by alcohol companies might be addressed.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Health and Children I very much welcome the new Intoxicating Liquor Bill which is being brought through the D&aacute;il at present by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.   The Bill seeks to curtail alcohol consumption in public places, tackle the increased visibility and availability of alcohol through retail outlets and off-licences and tighten the conditions under which premises such as late bars and nightclubs can remain open beyond normal closing time.</P>
        <P>In regard to drug misuse, the HSE is identified as the lead co-ordination agency for the implementation of the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation published by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in May 2007.</P>
        <P>The planning and development of a minimum of 25 detoxification residential beds recommended in the Drugs Rehabilitation report will be addressed in conjunction with the recommendations contained in the HSE Report of the Working Group on Residential Treatment and Rehabilitation Services which addressed the needs for addiction and alcohol services on a national basis.  The planning for these beds, as revenue and staff are made available, will be carried out in the context of the mapping and analysis of existing services; prevalence <Col N="227"/>data/trends; the phased priority planning of future service needs &mdash; including taking account of the capacity of the voluntary sector and in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s transformation programme.  The HSE&rsquo;s addiction service prioritises those under 18 years of age and, as resources permit, the HSE is implementing the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on Treatment for Under 18 year Olds Presenting to Treatment Services with Serious Drug Problems.</P>
        <P>In recent times, the HSE has re-oriented its addiction services to address the needs arising from changing patterns of drug use in the population e.g. poly drug use &mdash; including cocaine use. The HSE is also involved in developing community based stand-alone stimulant intervention services which includes additional training for its staff on issues such as cocaine and it is also re-engineering existing addiction services to meet emerging needs.</P>

	<P>Issues relating to the misuse of alcohol, including binge drinking, are being addressed through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, in primary and second level schools. Through SPHE, children can develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their decisions and actions both now and in the future to enhance their health and well-being. </P>
        <P>Support for the programme at primary level is provided through the Primary Curriculum Support Programme (PCSP). At post primary level the SPHE Support Service (Post Primary) works as a partnership between my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the HSE to support teachers and schools through on-going inservice training and support.  Similar initiatives are underway in the non-formal education setting through partnerships with the key agencies.</P>
        <P>Following a recommendation in the National Drugs Strategy 2000-2008, all schools have been offered guidance and support in developing a Substance Use policy setting out, in writing, the framework within which the whole school community manages issues relating to substance use.  It should reflect the unique ethos of the school and should aim to develop a shared understanding. Each policy should cover the core components; education concerning substance use, management of incidents and provision for training and staff development.</P>
        <P>National public information and awareness campaigns on alcohol are undertaken by the HSE.  The latest HSE public information campaign on underage drinking was launched in May this year.</P>

Since September my office has undertaken a small survey of some of the existing caf&eacute;s looking at mission/objectives, management and organisation, service levels and the role of young people.  My Office also sought the input of the <Col N="228"/>National Children&rsquo;s Advisory Council on the development of a youth caf&eacute; model. A final draft of the work of the Council has been prepared on its behalf by the Child and Family Research Centre at NUIG and will be submitted to me shortly.  This work will guide Government in ensuring that funding is targeted and co-ordinated most effectively on a model or models of youth caf&eacute;s which meet the needs identified by young people themselves. Preliminary indications are that the best model will be based on an interagency framework, developed for and responsive to the needs of the young people in the particular locality. Any seed funding made available will be aimed at the development of new and existing youth cafes and will be intended to augment, without displacing, the existing inter-agency resources.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 302 and 303 together.</P>
        <P>The Report of the National Working Group on the Regulation of Complementary Therapists in 2006 made recommendations on strengthening the regulatory environment for complementary therapists including voluntary self-regulation for the majority of therapists and statutory regulation for Acupuncturists, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners and Herbal practitioners.</P>
        <P>To support the development of robust voluntary self-regulation, the Report of the National Working Group outlined guidance for professional associations and provided examples of codes of ethics and good practice, including grievance and disciplinary procedures. In addition, this Department has facilitated the provision of work days. The purpose of these days is for different therapies to come together to undertake a process of harmonisation and development with regard to common basic standards of practice, education and training. In addition, these facilitated work days provide a forum for greater cohesion within each therapy.  Work days were organised in 2007 for a number of the higher risk therapies as categorised in the Report of the National Working Group on the Regulation of Complementary Therapists i.e. acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, aromatherapy and homoeopathy.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, an Information Guide for the Public has been produced offering guidance for members of the public when choosing to see a complementary therapist.</P>
        <P>The certification of complementary therapy training courses was also recommended in the Report of the National Working Group on the Regulation of Complementary Therapists.  In this regard, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) is developing standards for complementary therapy education courses.</P>
        <P>The coexistence of complementary and conventional medicine is often called Integrated Medicine. Integrated medicine refers to an approach where therapies are largely a complement to, rather than an alternative to, conventional biomedicine. It often combines mainstream medical therapies and complementary therapies for which there is some scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness (UK House of Lords Report 2000). The Report recommended the establishment of a forum for dialogue between the complementary and conventional medical sectors.</P>
        <P>My Department is considering the best way to progress this proposal. Consultation may need to take place with various service divisions within my Department and the HSE as the principal provider of health and social care services. In addition to the issues mentioned above, the type and location of services needs to be considered. It is hoped that progress in the development of appropriate forums between complementary and conventional medicines can be achieved over time and that mechanisms for robust voluntary self-regulation will continue to be pursued.</P>

	<P>The Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child. SPHE promotes intrapersonal development by helping children to recognise, understand and accept themselves as unique individuals who feel valued and loved. The curriculum is presented in three strands: Myself, Myself and Others and Myself and the wider world.   The Myself strand is concerned with the personal development element and in particular this strand fosters self-awareness and understanding. The strand units Self Identity; Taking Care of my Body and Growing and Changing provide opportunities to educate the child on body positive self image.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 311 and 312 together.</P>
        <P>There is no provision under Irish law requiring the preparation of post adoption reports in respect of children once an adoption order has been made in respect of a child. Once a child is adopted the adoptive parents are considered to have all of the rights and duties of parents and the protection of the family afforded under the Constitution. Therefore, any intervention, such as the post adoption reporting would be unconstitutional and would attempt to treat adoptive families different to other families. This would be inconsistent with the concept of adoption under Irish law in which an order brings the same effects as if the child was born to the family.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the above, adoptive parents do comply with the provision of post-adoption reports where they are required to do so by countries in the context of intercountry adoption. This is considered good practice but also assures other jurisdictions regarding the safety and care of children which they have allowed to be adopted across jurisdictions. The co-operation of adoptive parents is important in ensuring the continued willingness of other jurisdictions to allow Irish applicants to adopt. In this context, the HSE has continuously prepared and provided post adoption reports in line with the requirements of foreign jurisdictions and the Adoption Board facilitates the transmission of such reports where required.</P>
        <P>The issues raised in this particular case have been brought to my attention in the last week. My officials are currently examining the case and any administrative solution which might meet with the requirements of the authorities in the foreign jurisdiction. It is important to understand however that ultimately, it is the foreign jurisdiction which makes the decision as to whether an applicant can adopt or not and whether it will accept what this jurisdiction can provide for by law.</P>

	<P>The Multi Annual Investment Programme for Disability Services makes provision for the development of additional residential, respite places and day care places each year between 2006 and 2009 for people with Intellectual Disability and Autism and additional residential care and home support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Some &euro;50m was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2008 to fund a range of additional services under the Multi Annual Investment Programme for Disability. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the commencement of the planned developments in disability services this year had been delayed due to a financial review in the HSE.  However, I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the HSE has assured me that it is now in a position to roll out the planned developments as outlined in its 2008 Service Plan.</P>
        <P>Planned services include additional residential, day care &mdash; including training places &mdash; and respite care places for people with intellectual disability and autism; additional residential care and home support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities; and additional multi-disciplinary therapy posts to provide assessment and ongoing intervention services to children with a disability.</P>

	<P>The Department has been advised by the Health Service Executive (HSE) that it is progressing with the task of transferring past interest retained on invested patient private property accounts.  A process to undertake this transfer, initially for the period 2005-2006, has been agreed.  Following discussions with the Revenue Commissioners, the HSE has received confirmation that refunds will not give rise to any tax implications for either the individual client or the HSE.  This confirmation now enables the HSE to commence the refund process.  The Department has been advised by the HSE that it is working on proposals to refund interest retained on the investment of patient private property funds prior to 2005 and the confirmation received from the Revenue Commissioners will allow these proposals to be finalised.  Until these proposals are agreed, the HSE has indicated that it will not be in a position to provide estimates of the cost of administering these refunds.  The overall estimate for total refund of interest remains as previously advised, approximately &euro;31m or approximately &euro;48m when adjusted for inflation by reference to the Consumer Price Index. </P>

	<P>I am not aware of any specific investigation of the kind mentioned by the Deputy.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) is currently undertaking a National Review of HSE funded adult day services.  This review includes sheltered workshops.  The Review&rsquo;s terms of reference are to advise on the reconfiguration and modernisation of existing Adult Day Services to reflect the core principles of the Health Strategy &mdash; Access, Quality, Accountability and Person Centredness &mdash; to incorporate the following approach: Best Practice; Good value for money; Better outcomes for services users in line with relevant legislation and national standards. </P>
        <P>This process aims to produce a recommended service model/s that is reflective of these principles.  The work of the Review is well underway and a report is due by the Autumn.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the HSE Review, the Office for Disability and Mental Health is also actively working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment towards improving and developing employment opportunities for people with disabilities.</P>

        <Quest> if, in view of the <Col N="238"/>planned downgrading of Roscommon County Hospital accident and emergency, if she will make funding available for first responder schemes for community groups within the large geographic catchment of the hospital; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is committed not only to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health services possible but to doing so in an effective and efficient way.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, to ensure that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved. In this context it is essential that every healthcare provider and facility is fully cognisant of patient safety and quality issues and takes account of these in the organisation, management and delivery of services.  The priority is to provide safe services as close as possible to where people live. </P>
        <P>In the past, Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe have operated independently, with two consultant general surgeons in each hospital.  The difficulties faced by Roscommon and Portiuncula in maintaining surgical services independently, and the need for closer co-operation between them, were highlighted by the former Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al in March 2006.  Advances in clinical care and ever-increasing levels of specialisation mean that the present model of care is no longer sustainable.  Small stand-alone hospital services will not be able to offer their doctors the opportunity to treat a sufficient volume and variety of patients to maintain their skills, nor will they be able to provide the range of experience required for doctors during training.  As a result, it will prove increasingly difficult, and perhaps impossible, to fill consultant posts on a permanent basis.</P>
        <P>In the light of these factors, the best way of retaining and developing services at Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals is for these hospitals to work together.  I am confident that the development of joint departments of surgery and anaesthesia at the hospitals will provide a better service for patients of both hospitals.  The Health Service Executive is in the process of undertaking a detailed planning and consultation process with stakeholders on how best to implement the proposed changes to how services are organised at the two hospitals.</P>
        <P>In relation to the first responder scheme, the funding, management and delivery of health and personal social services, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Tackling all Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) continues to be a priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </P>
        <P>The HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk. <Col N="239"/> The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.</P>
        <P>A new National Surveillance System has been established by the HSE to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis on four key areas, to monitor HCAIs in our health system: Staphylococcus bacteraemia (blood stream infections); Antibiotic consumption; Alcohol gel use; MRSA Surveillance in Intensive Care Units, from 2008 onwards.</P>
        <P>This data (excluding MRSA in ICUs) has been compiled and published for 2006 and 2007.  I attach in table format an extract of the relevant information for the Deputy, taken from the recent report of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  The table gives the number of MRSA bloodstream isolates by acute public hospital for 2007.  Most of the variation in reported numbers of S. aureus bloodstream infections between hospitals can be explained by differences in hospital size, activity and patient populations.  At present there is no way to adjust the data to allow for these differences and hence direct comparisons between hospitals are not possible.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that if a patient is diagnosed with a bloodstream infection at a given hospital it does not indicate that the infection was acquired at that hospital.  Many bloodstream infections are acquired in the community, but only diagnosed upon admission to hospital.  A patient may either have acquired the infection in one hospital, but the infection may be diagnosed on transfer to another hospital.</P>
        <P>While the data in the report comes with multiple caveats, it does nonetheless represent a significant step forward in terms of providing essential data that will serve as a benchmark for assessing progress in the future.  I firmly believe that you cannot manage what you do not measure. We have now with this system begun a very useful measurement process.</P>
        <P>The results so far show some improvement in 2007 over 2006.  The overall S. Aureus bloodstream infection rate was lower in 2007 (0.36) compared to 2006 (0.37).  The overall proportion of MRSA was also lower in 2007 (38.5%) compared to 2006 (42.4%).  The overall acute in-patient antibiotic consumption rate is marginally up in 2007 over the 2006 rate by 2.4%.  The overall alcohol gel use is up by a significant 50%.  The results provide a good benchmark to enable us to measure the progress of each hospital.  From now on, this data will be available on a quarterly basis.</P>
        <P>In March 2008, the Chief Medical Officer of my Department instructed the HSE to make C. difficile a notifiable disease and since May 4th all cases are required to be notified to the relevant Department of Public Health.  The number of cases reported to date is within the range identified in the Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections in acute hospitals in 2006, 0.5% of patients studied.</P>
        <P>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) published Guidelines for the Surveillance, Management and Control of C. difficile-associated disease on 22nd May 2008.  They give national guidance and deal with the isolation of C. difficile ribotype 027 for the first time in Irish hospitals.  They will be a valuable resource in assisting in the prevention, management and control of this infectious disease.  The HSE is considering the report at present to decide on its implementation and I have asked to be kept informed of progress on this matter.</P>
        <P>Since 2006, over 30 new staff in posts of Senior Pharmacists, Senior Infection Control Nurses and Surveillance Scientists have been appointed specifically to enhance infection control.  I have instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used for isolation purposes where required for patients who contract HCAIs.  New environmental building guidelines to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments are expected to be published by the HSE later this month.</P><Col N="240"/>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertook a comprehensive review of hygiene in our acute hospitals in 2007 and published its report last November.  The report represents a thorough assessment of how hygiene services are provided and managed in 51 HSE-funded acute care hospitals.  This allows individual hospitals identify strengths and areas for improvement.  HIQA is following up on this review to ensure that deficits identified during that process are rectified and the Authority will be undertaking a further national review this Autumn.  In addition, on 3rd June HIQA published draft Infection Prevention and Control Standards for public consultation.  When finalised, these, along with the National Hygiene Standards, will provide a comprehensive framework to control infection in all healthcare settings.</P>
        <P>While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

	<P>The Multi Annual Investment Programme for Disability Services makes provision for the development of additional residential, respite places and day care places each year between 2006 and 2009 for people with Intellectual Disability and Autism and additional residential care and home support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Some &euro;50m was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2008 to fund a range of additional services under the Multi Annual Investment Programme for Disability. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the commencement of the planned developments in disability services this year had been delayed due to a financial review in the HSE.  However, I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the HSE has assured me that it is now in a position to roll out the planned developments as outlined in its 2008 Service Plan.</P>
        <P>Planned services include additional residential, day care &mdash; including training places &mdash; and respite care places for people with intellectual disability and autism; additional residential care and home support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities; and additional multi-disciplinary therapy posts to provide assessment and ongoing intervention services to children with a disability.</P>
        <P>I understand that the HSE hopes to be able to finalise the position in relation to the commencement of such developments over the next week.</P>
        <P>My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the specific matter raised by the Deputy investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <P>The operation of the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE (PAD) allows for the centralised receipt, assignment and tracking of Parliamentary Questions within the HSE&rsquo;s extensive network of operations. More generally, PAD monitors overall performance in relation to the timely issue of replies and provides a central contact for all requests from Oireachtas members for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the Executive. It reports on a regular basis to the Chief Executive officer and his management team.</P>
        <P>In 2007 the Chief Executive Officer of the HSE, Professor Drumm, reiterated to Oireachtas members the importance he attaches to providing replies to Parliamentary Questions and affirmed his focus on improving the turnaround time for replies to the greatest possible extent. The Chief Executive Officer circulated a briefing document to Oireachtas members which informed them of his decision to introduce a shorter time frame of 15 working days for replies from January 2008 and also outlined new accountability structures being introduced to further improve the HSE&rsquo;s performance in this area. In the period January to June 2008, a total of 1,835 questions were referred to the HSE for direct reply. During this period 1,642 replies were issued by the Executive and of these, 71% of replies were issued by the HSE within the new 15 day timeframe.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In recent years there have been significant improvements to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed.  Since the beginning of 2005, the qualification guidelines have increased by a cumulative 29% (7.5% and 20% in January and October 2005 respectively).  Assessment is now based on a person&rsquo;s and, where relevant, his/her spouse&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.  In June 2006, there was a further increase in the qualification threshold for the GP visit card to 50% above that for a medical card (previously 25%).</P>

	<P>The report of a consultancy firm, commissioned by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to carry out an independent study on a <Col N="248"/>possible location for a new Regional Hospital in the North East, was considered by the Board of the HSE on 9th April last.  The contents of the report were noted by the Board.  </P>
        <P>The findings of the recently published OECD review of the Irish Public Service report &mdash; Ireland Towards an Integrated Public Service &mdash; suggested that a broader examination of international systems would help to identify how other countries have met the health needs of areas with characteristics similar to the North East.   The OECD took the view that such an examination could include the possibility of having two hospitals, one regional and one general, in the North East.  It added that the outcome of such an examination could equally be a reaffirmation of the plan for one acute hospital for the region.</P>
        <P>The findings of the OECD report will need to be carefully considered in the context of the Transformation Programme for the North East.</P>
        <P>No decision has been taken to date by the Government or by the HSE on the location of the new hospital.</P>
        <P>The immediate focus of the Transformation Programme is to have acute and complex care moved from 5 to 2 hospital sites and to ensure that services in the region are organised to optimise patient safety.  The first step in the development of a fully integrated regional health service is to ensure that the people of the North East have local access to both routine planned care and immediate life saving emergency care.  Over the next few years, in preparation for all acute emergency in-patient care and complex planned care being provided at a regional centre, the existing five hospitals will continue to improve services by further merger of their acute care specialties.</P>

	<P>Under Public Financial Procedures it is possible to vire savings on one or more subheads to meet excess expenditure on another subhead or subheads in the same Vote with the sanction of the Department of Finance.  However no request to vire monies from one sub-head to another within the HSE Vote has been made to date in 2008.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Department of Finance sanction  for the HSE Vote, specific sanction must be sought if the HSE wishes to use monies provided in the 2008 Budget for other purposes.   Sanction has been sought and received from the Department of Finance for (i) the spending of &euro;13 million from the Fair Deal provision of &euro;110 million on 200 extra contract beds and (ii) the use of a further &euro;12 million of these moneys for enhanced subvention and contract beds arising from increases in the cost of nursing home fees.  These measures will assist older people and their families in advance of the completion and implementation of legislation on Fair Deal.  No other requests for approval to transfer funding requiring sanction have been made this year.</P>

The question of whether or not funding can be provided for the, now concluded, project under the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), for which I have responsibility, was examined.

        <Quest> if, in the situation where diagnostic breast cancer services will close in Sligo General Hospital by the end of 2008, <Col N="256"/>she will confirm that the BreastCheck service will be available to all women in Counties Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on the National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services, and the fact that the BreastCheck screening programme will significantly reduce the number of symptomatic breast cancer presentations, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has designated eight specialist breast cancer centres nationally.  The National Cancer Control Programme has identified University College Hospital Galway (UCHG) as one of the designated specialist cancer centres for the Western region.  The Programme therefore will consolidate symptomatic breast cancer services in UCHG.  This involves a transfer of the Sligo symptomatic breast service to UCHG. </P>
        <P>BreastCheck commenced the screening process in the Western Region last May, with the provision of a mobile unit on the grounds of Roscommon County Hospital.  I officially opened the BreastCheck static unit for the Western Region at University College Hospital Galway last December.</P>
        <P>An additional &euro;26.7 million capital funding was provided for the construction of two new static units, eight additional mobile units and the provision of state of the art digital equipment.  A total of &euro;15 million additional revenue funding has been allocated to cater for national roll-out of the programme.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved and recruitment is underway.  The screening sequence for roll out to individual counties will be dictated by BreastCheck&rsquo;s operational considerations such as maximising uptake, most efficient use of mobile and static units and radiographic personnel.  The programme is designed to offer repeat screening within an interval of 21-27 months.  Women in Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal will be screened from a mobile digital screening unit linked to the Western Unit.</P>

The purpose of the policy is about improving the lives of children through creating more and better public play facilities for them.  To date, over &euro;28million has been expended on improving play infrastructure around the country.  This has resulted in an increase from less than 200 to over 500 playgrounds throughout the country.    </P>

Progress with the completion of these projects is a matter for the individual local authorities and time scales have varied considerably due to a range of planning and procurement issues locally.  Consideration of a scheme in 2007 was deferred to allow local authorities to make progress with over 80 outstanding projects.

The international evidence indicates that this can be achieved by centralising acute and complex care so that clinical skill levels can be safeguarded through ensuring sufficient throughput of cases.  This was highlighted in the Teamwork Report &mdash; &ldquo;Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards &mdash; An Action Plan for Health Services in the North East&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In progressing the Transformation Programme the HSE has repeatedly emphasised its commitment that existing services in the region will remain in place until they are replaced with higher quality, safer or more appropriate services.  The overriding aim of the Programme, which I fully support, is the need to improve safety and achieve better standards of care for patients in the region.</P>
        <P>The immediate focus of the Transformation Programme, which has now moved into the detailed design and implementation phase, is to have acute and complex care moved from five to two hospital sites and to ensure that services in the region are organised to optimise patient safety.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that the initial set of service changes for Louth-Meath in the context of the Transformation Programme centres on the reconfiguration of surgery with the establishment of a single Department of Surgery for Louth-Meath and the centralisation of complex major surgical care to one hospital.</P>
        <P>In relation to out of hours emergency surgery activity levels in Louth County Hospital, the HSE has advised that there were 14 out of hours surgical procedures in 2007, effectively a rate of little more than one a month.  In the context of its ongoing assessment of services and reflecting this level of activity, changes in the provision of surgical cover in Louth County Hospital were announced by the HSE from 1 July.  These changes will ensure that any on call requirements at the Hospital will be provided in the first instance by the Surgical Registrar, the most senior doctor apart from a Consultant.  It is my understanding that certain issues have arisen following these changes and that these have now been referred by the HSE to the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
        <P>Operational responsibility for the implementation of specific service changes is a matter for the HSE.  Therefore, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE to arrange to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy in relation to the specific issues raised.</P>

	<P>I am not aware of any relevant research or statistics relating to these tests either nationally or in the Cork Harbour area.  The area of study comprehended by the Deputy is referred to as Human Bio-Monitoring (HBM).  The E.U. is at an early stage of examining the feasibility of a coherent approach to HBM in Europe.  I understand however, that it is recognised internationally as a complex area not least because some studies are longitudinal in nature and may require invasive procedures.  Experience has shown that this can lead to a high attrition rate among participants over time.  The matter is further complicated, at this stage, by the lack of internationally agreed mechanisms for such studies which would provide comparative data within and between countries.  I understand that the discussions at EU level will endeavour to address all of these matters. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 403 to 405, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE), assisted by my Department, has engaged with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) on discussions surrounding a number of outstanding issues.  These discussions commenced in the week beginning 5 May 2008. Progress has been made on these issues.</P>
        <P>I established an Independent Pricing Body, chaired by Mr Sean Dorgan, former Head of IDA Ireland, to assess an interim, fair community pharmacy dispensing fee to be paid for the medical card scheme, the DPS and other community drug schemes.  The Independent Pricing Body has submitted its report to me and I am considering its findings prior to submitting it to Government.</P>

        <Quest> the number of pharmacists, on a county basis, who tendered their resignation to the Health Service Executive as a result of the crisis over the new pay structure within their sector; if any of those resignations have been withdrawn; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No community pharmacist has withdrawn from the GMS and community drugs schemes as a result of recent developments in the sector, and all patients continue to receive their entitlements in the normal way.  The Health Service Executive (HSE), assisted by my Department, has engaged with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) on discussions surrounding a number of outstanding issues.  These discussions commenced in the week beginning 5 May 2008. Progress has been made on these issues.</P>

Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular issue raised by the Deputy.

	<P>Eight grants in total were approved to community based facilities in Co. Leitrim in 2006.  Two of these were for capital funding with projections to create a total of 40 child care places. </P>
        <P>A total of 14 grants were approved to Co. Leitrim community facilities in 2007.  Of these, two were for capital funding, the remainder for &lsquo;current&rsquo; (operational) funding.  The two 2007 capital grants were projected to create a total of 71 additional places.</P>
        <P>To date in 2008, a total of 31 grants have been approved to community facilities in Leitrim.  Of these, three are for capital funding with a total of 105 places projected to be created from these.</P>
        <P>No grants yet have an approval date post June this year, however 20 of the grants for &lsquo;current&rsquo; (operational) funding approved in the first half of this year relate to funding specifically for the period July &mdash; December 2008.</P>
        <P>To date, a total of 20 community based applicants/facilities in Co. Leitrim have been funded under the child care Programmes for the provision of a total of 866 child care places.  It is not possible to attribute the support or creation of these places to specific funding types.  A breakdown by facility, amount awarded and places per facility is set out below.</P>

	<P>The National Cancer Registry has informed my Department that it did not publish a report regarding cancer incidents in the Cork Harbour area between 1994 and 2005.  The Registry responded to a query from a journalist seeking cancer statistics for specified electoral divisions in the Cork Harbour area.  The Registry, while noting that the incidence in the area was higher than the national average, cautioned that a variety of risk factors might be involved and that there was a potential association with socio-economic status.  This caution was not initially reported in the media. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The registry has advised that the response also included the following information &ldquo;It is important to bear in mind that in the Cork Harbour area, a very wide range of cancer types were diagnosed.  Risk factors for cancer vary greatly depending on the type of cancer and most variation in incidence between areas is known to be due to personal characteristics and not the external environment.  Cancer incidence is known to be linked to social and economic status&rdquo;.  A deprivation index was also given which showed that for example, while Cobh Urban area has a comparatively high cancer incidence it also has a high deprivation score (9 out of 10).  This index was developed by a group in Trinity College Dublin (SAHRU) and is compiled from various factors, mostly obtained from census data.  In relation to the baseline study my colleague, Mr John Gormley, Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated that consideration should be given to such a study.</P>

	<P>The Expenditure Review on CI&Eacute; subvention was published and presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas in November, 2007.  The purpose of the review was to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the subvention paid to CI&Eacute; over the period 2001 &mdash; 2005.  A cost and efficiency review of both Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann has commenced and it expected that a final report will be received in the autumn.</P>

        <P>Expenditure by the Railway Procurement Agency relates to Luas and Metro projects in the Greater Dublin Area only.  &euro;121.614 million in capital funding was spent on Luas/Metro projects in 2007.  To end June 2008, &euro;75.376 million in capital funding has been spent.</P>
        <P>Expenditure under the Rural Transport Programme in 2007 was &euro;7.05m million.  Expenditure of &euro;1.73 million was incurred in the first quarter of 2008.  While the final figures for the second quarter are not yet available, it is expected that expenditure of some &euro;2 million was incurred.  It is not possible to break down expenditure under the Rural Transport Programme on a county by county basis as a number of the funded community transport groups operate across county boundaries.</P>

	<P>A new regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on public passenger transport services by rail and by road, Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007 of 23 October 2007, will come into force on 3 December 2009.  The Regulation creates a framework regulating how Member States award exclusive rights and pay compensation for services deemed to be &lsquo;public service obligations&rsquo;.  The purpose is to ensure transparency in the award of subvention for public transport services.  The Regulation requires all PSO transport services to be subject to contracts.</P>
        <P>At present the provision of funding to Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is based on Memoranda of Understanding between the companies and the Minister.  It is proposed to replace these memoranda with contracts before 3 December 2009 in order to comply with the new EU Regulation.  In the case of the GDA, these contracts will be put in place in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, which is currently before the Oireachtas.</P><Col N="285"/>

	<P>The EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States below the EU minimum duty rate.  In the case of public transport services under my responsibility, these derogations included reduced rates to apply to fuel used for scheduled bus services.  Scheduled bus services comprise bus passenger services provided by Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann, private operators in accordance with bus route licences under the 1932 Road Transport Act and holders of Authorisations pursuant to European Council Regulation 684/92 as amended.</P>
        <P>While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, which is the deciding authority, has to date refused all such requests.  The Finance Act 2008 provided the basis for the removal of these excise duty reliefs with effect from 1 November 2008.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and other Departments, has been exploring whether alternative support mechanisms could be appropriate and could be done in a manner compatible with EU State Aid and other legal requirements.</P>
        <P>My Department has also met the Coach Tourism and Transport Council, as well as CIE, on this matter.  My Department has also received a written submission from the Coach Tourism and Transport Council.</P>
        <P>While my Department is in discussion with the Department of Finance on these issues, it is necessary to stress that, despite claims being made otherwise, introducing an alternative suitable mechanism is not a straightforward matter in the current economic climate.  I don&rsquo;t envisage any approval from the Department of Finance for a replacement scheme in the current economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>The issue of how to better facilitate and promote public transport services is being considered in the context of the development of the Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan.</P>
        <P>Initiatives under the Rural Transport Programme do not involve scheduled bus services.  Accordingly they are not affected by the cessation of fuel excise repayments from 1 November 2008.</P>

	<P>Currently a smart card system is in place on LUAS services and Dublin Bus will commence rolling out an interim smart card on their services later this month.  Irish Rail also intend to introduce their own interim smart card systems in mid 2009.  These interim cards will enable both users and operators to familiarise <Col N="286"/>themselves with the use and flexibilities of smart card systems.  All interim systems will migrate to the Integrated Ticketing System.</P>
        <P>The initial rollout of the Integrated Ticketing Scheme will commence on the services of Dublin Bus and the Luas in late 2009.  Within the following 12 months, it will be extended to Irish Rail, Dart and commuter rail services in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann will also be implementing a smart card on a pilot basis on a number of its commuter routes.  It is also hoped that other private bus operators will join the scheme over this period.</P>
        <P>The new public service card being developed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be rolled out later this year.  It will also be a smart card for free travel under the Integrated Ticketing Scheme.  This phased roll-out of the integrated ticketing system is in line with best international practice.</P>
        <P>Contract negotiations to build the Back Office and associated systems are currently being finalised and it is expected that the contract will be awarded in the coming weeks.  Once the Back Office contract is finalised, the Project Team will immediately move to commence the EU public procurement process for a contractor to operate the system.  It is expected that contract will be awarded in early 2009.</P>
        <P>In December 2006, the Project Board put the expected capital cost of the integrated ticketing project at &euro;49.6 million.  This was based on pre-tender best estimates at that time in respect of a number of elements of the project.  In the light of the progress being made, it appears from the actual tenders received to date, as distinct from previous estimates, that the price is likely to be at a level higher than that provided for in the budget.  The final costs and timelines for implementation will become clearer when all public procurement processes are complete and tender prices are known.  In the meantime, I am being kept appraised of ongoing developments by the Integrated Ticketing Project Board.</P>

	<P>The First Railway Package was published in the Official Journal in March 2001 and is part of a broader package of proposals aimed at revitalising the rail sector.  The Railway Package comprises three directives:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Directive 2001/12 amending Directive 91/440/EC on the development of the Community&rsquo;s railways,</P><Col N="287"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Directive 2001/13 amending Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Directive 2001/14, replacing Directive 95/19/EC, on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of the railway infrastructure and safety certification.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Broadly speaking, these Directives opened up the rail freight market further by requiring Member States to grant access to what is defined as the Trans-European Rail freight network (a series of lines across the EU which includes the Cork-Dublin-Belfast-Larne line) to any railway company wishing to provide international freight services.  The Directives also sought to ensure that all railway companies are treated in a fair and equitable manner and provide for the efficient and competitive use of infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The Directives contained in the First Railway Package, with the exception of Article 6 of Directive 2001/14, have been fully transposed into national legislation through Statutory Instruments, S.I. No. 536 of 2003 &mdash; European Communities (Access to Railway Infrastructure) Regulations 2003 transposing Directive 2001/12/EC, S.I. No. 537 of 2003, European Communities (Licensing of Railway Undertakings) Regulations 2003 transposing Directive 2001/13/EC and S.I. No. 643 of 2004, European Communities European Communities (Allocation of Railway Infrastructure Capacity and the levying of Charges for the use of Railway Infrastructure and Safety Certification) Regulations 2004 transposing Directive 2001/14/EC.</P>
        <P>Article 6 of Directive 2001/14 deals with incentives to reduce the cost of providing railway infrastructure and the level of charges for access by third parties to the railway.  The most appropriate mechanism, permitted by the Directive, for doing this, is a contract between a competent authority and the infrastructure manager.  In an Irish context, primary legislation is required to facilitate this.  It is proposed that appropriate legislation will be introduced at the earliest opportunity.  The Commission was advised of this position at the time of the transposition of the Directive.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s response to the proposals in the First Railway Package when it was at draft stage was to ensure that any directives adopted took account of our unique rail gauge and the fact that Ireland was isolated from the main European rail network and would not impose significant bureaucratic costs with little or no associated benefits.  The Council agreed on the need for derogations for Ireland, (and Northern Ireland and Greece) to the more onerous administrative requirements in the directives contained in the First Railway Package.  The derogations were granted for a five-year period until March 2008, but can be renewed.  However they are conditional on (a) no railway undertaking from outside the island of Ireland applying to operate competing services and (b) no railway undertaking operating in Ireland applying to operate services in another Member State.  To date, no such applications have been received.  On this basis, we have been in correspondence with the European Commission requesting a further five-year extension of these derogations and are awaiting the formal response of the Commission on this request.</P>
        <P>On 26 June 2008 a letter of formal notice of an infringement was issued by the Commission in relation to the manner of implementation of Directive 2001/14/EC.  This relates in the main to the absence of an infrastructure charging regime and failure to transpose Article 6 of Directive 2001/14/EC.  The Commission has invited Ireland to submit observations within two months on this matter.  A response to the Commission is in preparation.</P>

	<P>The planning and implementation of individual mainline rail development projects under Transport 21, including the Navan Rail Link is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the position in regard to the Clonee/Dunboyne (Pace) section of the Navan rail Link is that the company expects to award a tender for the construction of the project in September.  The position regarding the Dunboyne to Navan section is that Transport 21 provides, subject to compliance with the capital investment appraisal guidelines, for the construction of this phase by 2015.</P>

This includes a requirement for a public consultation process. That process is being undertaken in connection with an application by the National Roads Authority for redesignation of elements of the N6, N7, N8 and N9 as motorways. A number of written submissions have been received and these submissions are currently under consideration in my Department.

	<P>The Value for Money and Policy Review of the Support for Irish Emigrants Groups Programme, which was undertaken by Goodbody Economic Consultants, was completed in July, 2007. Copies of the Report were lodged with the Houses of the Oireachtas on 1 August 2007 and with the Value for Money and Policy Review Secretariat of the Department of Finance at the same time. The Review was undertaken against the background of the rapid expansion in the Emigrant Groups Support Programme, in terms of financial allocations, the number of organisations funded and the geographic spread. At &euro;15.183 million, the record funding allocated to the Programme in 2008 is three times greater than that allocated in 2004, and represents a fifteen fold increase over the past decade.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Review was to examine the objectives of the Programme, the economic effectiveness and efficiency with which services are being delivered, and the quality and quantity of the outputs and benefits delivered to our communities abroad. While savings to the Exchequer did not constitute a part of the terms of reference of the Review, the recommendations in it will help to ensure that taxpayers&rsquo; funds have an even greater beneficial impact in the future. In this regard, since the Review&rsquo;s publication, the Irish Abroad Unit has worked to formalise the Programme&rsquo;s monitoring and evaluation systems. This year, for example, the grant application process for Britain and the United States has been handled on-line, with applicants required to outline clear objectives and performance outcome indicators. Overall, the Review has helped to enhance the Programme&rsquo;s systems of monitoring and evaluation, and to ensure that Government funding continues to be directed to organisations that reach the most vulnerable Irish people abroad.</P>
        <P>Overall, the Value for Money and Policy Review painted a very positive picture of the Department&rsquo;s work in this area, making the point that the approach adopted has been extremely effective and efficient. By working progressively to implement the Review&rsquo;s key <Col N="292"/>recommendations, the Irish Abroad Unit is ensuring even greater efficiency is achieved in the future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 455 to 458, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position with regard to the Value for Money Reviews referred to by the Deputy is as follows: Emergency and Humanitarian Assistance The Value for Money Review of Irish Aid&rsquo;s emergency humanitarian response to a selected disaster focused on the 2004 Asian Tsunami. The Review concluded that Irish Aid&rsquo;s overall response was appropriate and strategic, and that the programme of support was managed in an efficient and effective way, with no wastage of funds. The Review made some useful recommendations, including that, in supporting future emergencies, consideration should be given to selecting a smaller number of partner agencies with specific expertise.</P>
        <P>The report also recommended that Irish Aid should request evaluations of all humanitarian programmes to which it is contributing, and make all grants above &euro;300,000 conditional on such an overall and external programme evaluation being undertaken and submitted. While this will help to inform the evaluation process, the reality is that the vast majority of humanitarian contributions are to multilateral organisations such as the United Nations funds and agencies, and the Red Cross, which already carry out evaluations of the effectiveness of their humanitarian programmes.</P>
      <P el="10"><i>Passport Service</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Value for Money Review of the Passport Service is expected to be completed this month and published in the near future.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Mozambique Development Programme</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Value for Money Review of Development Aid to Mozambique was published in February 2008. The Review found the Programme to be satisfactory in terms of relevance, <Col N="293"/>effectiveness and efficiency. It made a number of useful recommendations to ensure that the Programme continues to be managed in an efficient and effective way. In order to enhance efficiency, the Review recommended that Irish Aid should consider concentrating the Programme on a more limited number of sectors. In response, Irish Aid&rsquo;s most recent Country Strategy Plan for Mozambique has identified specific priority areas on which support is to be focussed.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>HIV/AIDS Budget Line</i></P>
       <P el="0">The Review of the HIV and AIDS budget line is currently in progress and will be completed and published by the end of 2008.</P>

	<P>The case to which the Deputy refers relates to five Cuban citizens who were convicted in the US in 2001 on charges ranging from espionage to first degree murder. As I have previously informed the Deputy, it is my understanding that the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Georgia, has considered this case three times and most recently upheld the 2001 convictions on 4 June 2008. It is also my understanding that the defendants&rsquo; legal counsel is considering other avenues for appeal, including recourse to the US Supreme Court. I am aware that my colleague, Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht, has had informal contact with a Belgian group concerned with this case. However, as the Deputy has been advised previously, the Government has no standing in this matter, which is a bilateral consular question between the US and the Cuban authorities and, consequently, I do not intend to pursue this matter. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 460, 461 and 465 together.</P>
        <P>The situation in the ethnic Somali Ogaden region of Ethiopia has deteriorated sharply in the last six months. The conflict between the Ethiopian Government and the Ogaden National <Col N="294"/>Liberation Front (ONLF) is causing serious hardship for the mainly pastoralist and nomadic people of the region, whose livelihoods have been disrupted. Aid agencies are concerned at the restrictions on humanitarian access to this conflict and drought-affected region. While the Government of Ethiopia has an overriding responsibility to restore order in this troubled region, it should do all it can to minimise the impact of the conflict on ordinary people, and to ensure full respect for human rights and international humanitarian law. On several occasions, both in Addis Ababa and in Dublin, we have conveyed to the Ethiopian authorities Ireland&rsquo;s concern about the reports we have received in relation to the Ogaden region. We will continue to highlight these concerns until the situation is resolved. Ireland has also taken the lead in pressing for the EU to engage with Ethiopia in relation to this situation, given the EU&rsquo;s importance as a partner for Ethiopia, and our shared commitment to the well-being and development of the Ethiopian people.</P>
        <P>Somalia has been without an effective government since 1991, and despite an initial period of stability after Ethiopian troops and Transitional Federal Government (TFG) forces defeated the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC) in December 2006, the situation has worsened in recent months. Fighting in Mogadishu has prompted many thousands to flee the capital, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis caused by drought. As recently as 9 June the TFG signed the Djibouti agreement with a key opposition group, which calls for a cessation of hostilities and the eventual withdrawal of Ethiopian troops, when circumstances allow. However, a number of other armed groups are active in Somalia, and the security situation in Mogadishu and surrounding areas remains extremely poor. In response to killings of Ethiopian soldiers, Ethiopian and TFG forces have attacked militants in densely-populated civilian areas, causing civilian casualties and people to flee.</P>
        <P>The situation in Somalia is regularly discussed by EU Foreign Ministers, and Conclusions adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 26 May called for unimpeded humanitarian access for relief agencies in Somalia and urged all parties to comply fully with international humanitarian law. Most recently, when my EU colleagues and I discussed Somalia on 16 June, we expressed support for the 9   June Djibouti Peace Agreement, and reiterated the urgent need to keep up the momentum of inclusive dialogue for a sustained political solution to the situation in Somalia.</P>
        <P>In relation to assistance to Ethiopia, I believe that Irish Aid funding makes a real and tangible difference to the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable people there. Our assistance to Ethiopia, delivered through national systems and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) such as Concern, GOAL, Tr&oacute;caire and Self Help Development International, together with aid delivered through UN agencies, continues to protect the poor and provides them with the most basic social services such as primary health care and education.</P>
        <P>Our aid programmes are also carefully monitored by our Embassy staff on the ground, and are externally evaluated in accordance with established practice. Ethiopia remains one of the poorest countries in the world and it is a difficult environment in which to work, although it has made remarkable progress in recent years. For all these reasons, and because availability of food is likely to remain a major concern during the coming months, I believe it is right to remain engaged in Ethiopia, in close cooperation with our donor partners. Every day our support is saving lives, helping to rebuild livelihoods and giving hope to some of the most vulnerable people in Ethiopia. I would also note that in our contacts with the Ethiopian opposition, they have made it clear that they do not believe that our aid programme should be cut.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 462 and 463 together.</P>
        <P>In advance of the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, the Government conducted an intensive information campaign aimed at providing the electorate with factual information about the Treaty. The Government did not commission any research on voter attitudes. However, individual political parties were of course free to conduct their own private research in terms of polling prior to the vote on 12 June.</P>
        <P>I have no information about any qualitative research that may have been available to opponents of the Lisbon Treaty during the campaign.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government, as part of their analysis on the outcome of the referendum, are currently commissioning a research project. The key objective of this research is to understand the reasons underlying voting decisions in the referendum and to analyse current public attitudes toward the European Union in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for two Votes, namely Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs) and Vote 29 (International Cooperation). Details of twenty three reports commissioned by my Department from 2002 to date in 2008 are set out in this answer.</P>
          <P el="10"><i>Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs) Reports</i></P>
        <P el="0"><i>Task Force on Policy Regarding Emigrants</i></P>
        <P>The Government established the Task Force in December 2001 to recommend a coherent long term policy approach to meeting the needs of Irish emigrants, with a particular emphasis on the young and vulnerable. The Task Force reported in August 2002. The total cost of the project, including travel, publication and research was &euro;136,086 which included costs incurred of &euro;70,224 for the research element which was carried out by Anglia Polytechnic University. Both Departmental officials and external experts contributed to the work of the Task Force.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Assessment of EU accession training programmes, 2001-2003</i></P>
        <P el="0">In 2004, A&amp;L Goodbody was commissioned to assess the Department&rsquo;s EU accession training programmes. The cost incurred was &euro;4,878. It took one week to complete and was delivered in May 2004. The report relates to an independent assessment by A&amp;L Goodbody of the Public Expenditure Review of the first two years of operation of the Department&rsquo;s Bilateral Assistance Programme to support the public administrations in candidate and acceding countries to the EU in improving their readiness for the demands of EU membership.</P>
        <P>The assessment, which was written by Peter Brennan of A&amp;L Goodbody, was delivered in May 2004 and found that &ldquo;the Department had done a very good and comprehensive job in gathering the evidence on the performance of the Programme to date and on seeking feedback on how the Programme is operating.&rdquo; Most of the recommendations contained in the Review have been implemented. The programme has been extended to new target countries (Croatia, Turkey and Republic of Macedonia), refined for EU membership (i.e. new Member States do not get same priority as candidates) and better performance indicators have been developed and used for new projects.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Assessment of Assistance programmes in Bulgaria and Romania by the IPA</i></P>
        <P el="0">In 2007, BCT Communications Ltd was commissioned to conduct an assessment of the Department-funded capacity building programmes provided by the Institute of Public Admini<Col N="299"/>stration in 2005/6 to the Bulgarian Institute of Public Administration and European Integration and the Romanian National Institute of Administration. The cost of preparing the report was &euro;20,469. It took one month approximately to complete and was delivered in April 2007.</P>
        <P>The report relates to an evaluation that was undertaken of DFA-funded assistance programmes in Bulgaria and Romania, delivered by the Institute of Public Administration (IPA). The evaluation was carried out by Declan Lyons of BCT Communications Ltd. and was carried out in Sofia and Bucharest. The review found that the programmes in Bulgaria and Romania were well designed and executed and that they delivered relevant, significant and obvious benefits to the partner institutes and civil services in each country. The programmes were cost effective and gave value for money. The report recommended that the programmes continue and identified areas for support. A follow-on programme of assistance to the Bulgarian Institute of Public Administration and European Integration (IPAEI) to enhance the capacity of the Bulgarian civil service, particularly in the areas or recruitment and promotion is being delivered in 2008/09.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Conflict Prevention</i></P>
       <P el="0">As part of preparations for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU in 2004, the NGO International Alert/Saferworld was commissioned to produce a paper on conflict prevention. It received &euro;10,000 for its work in preparing the paper, a copy of which can be found on International Alert&rsquo;s website, www.international-alert.org.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Human Rights</i></P>
      <P el="0">In April 2008, the Department funded the publication of the report &ldquo;Bullets in the Alms Bowl&rdquo;, by the Human Rights Documentation Unit of the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma. The funding provided was &euro;4,000. This report documented the brutal suppression of Burma&rsquo;s September 2007 monk-led protests through 50 detailed eyewitness interviews. It was launched on 17 June 2008.</P>
        <P>In June 2008, the Department agreed to fund research by the Irish Human Rights Centre, based at NUI Galway, on the situation of ethnic minority groups in Burma/Myanmar, at a cost of &euro;88,782. This research is to be conducted over a seven month period and will be led by Professor William Schabas. The aim of this study is to produce an authoritative, objective and independent report on the situation of the Rohingyas in Western Burma/Myanmar.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>Irish Prisoners Abroad</i></P>
      <P el="0">A report on Irish Prisoners Abroad was launched by the Minister on 13 August 2007. It was prepared by Mr. Chris Flood at a cost of &euro;6,066 (publication costs only). This report was commissioned to further enhance the services we provide to citizens incarcerated abroad. The key recommendations of the report are in the process of being implemented.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Irish Passport Service (Value for Money Review)</i></P>
      <P el="0">In 2008, KPMG was commissioned to conduct a value for money review of the Irish Passport service. It has cost &euro;55,782 and will be available later this year.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Support for Irish Emigrants (Value for Money Review)</i></P>
      <P el="0">The Value for Money and Policy Review of the Support for Irish Emigrants Groups Programme, which was undertaken by Goodbody Economic Consultants, was completed in July 2007. The purpose of the Review was to examine the objectives of the Programme, the econ<Col N="300"/>omic effectiveness and efficiency with which services are being delivered, and the quality and quantity of the outputs and benefits delivered to our communities abroad. The cost of commissioning the report was &euro;36,400.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Vote 29 (International Co-operation) Reports</i></P>
      <P el="0">The major reports commissioned by Irish Aid between 2002 and 2008 include the Report of the Irish Aid Review Committee in 2002, an Evaluation of Development Cooperation Ireland&rsquo;s Multi-annual Programme Scheme in 2005 and the ongoing Management Review of Irish Aid which is expected to report shortly.</P>
        <P>A number of reports have been commissioned by the Advisory Board of Irish Aid (ABIA) relating to themes of relevance to the Irish Aid programme since 2002. There have also been a number of Value for Money studies. These are detailed in tabular form. In addition, there are also a number of other short reports and reviews which are commissioned on operational aspects of the Irish Aid programme on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>The Hunger Task Force, which was appointed to identify the additional, appropriate and effective contributions that Ireland can make to international efforts to reduce hunger will report shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature. The State has established a number of institutions to assist in the resolution of trade disputes between employers and workers, including the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission.  The experience and expertise of these bodies are available free of charge to disputing parties.</P>
        <P>The parties may utilise the expert services of the State&rsquo;s dispute settling machinery to assist them.  The experience and expertise of these services offer the best avenue for resolving the differences between disputing parties.  Where the parties make full use of these procedures the evidence shows that a very high percentage of disputes are resolved through the conciliation process.  Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the parties to a trade dispute to ensure that a resolution to the dispute is achieved.</P>

         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Research Technology &amp; Innovation Competitive Grants Scheme;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Enterprise Ireland Collaboration Programme.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Expenditure Review contains a number of findings on the effectiveness of the Schemes reviewed and also made targeted recommendations on the overall usefulness of the agency supports for research and innovation in the business sector relative to national objectives with a focus on whether they constituted value for money and efficient use of public funds. The findings make a strong case for the continuation of State support for the agency RTDI Competitive, Collaboration and Capability schemes in a more focussed and co-ordinated format.</P>
        <P>The review contained a comprehensive list of recommendations, aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the Programmes reviewed and to improve the quality and quantity of research supported by the enterprise agencies. Many of the recommendations were mirrored in the Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation 2006&ndash;2013 and at this stage the bulk of them have been implemented by the two agencies involved &mdash; Enterprise Ireland and IDA.</P>

	<P>Overall, Ireland has performed very strongly over the last number of years.  However as the country&rsquo;s economy moves to higher value added activities, providing quality sustainable jobs, some traditional lower-cost industries throughout the country are under pressure and other lower-value activities are transferring out of Ireland.</P>
        <P>While I very much regret the decision of Hibernian Insurance to move jobs from Ireland, the relocation, or off-shoring, of some business functions and with it a certain number of jobs, is a reality of the modern global economic environment for a highly developed economy such as Ireland. This shift in the structure of international trade poses challenges to economic policy makers in all developed countries not just Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many of the job losses incurred as a result of relocation in recent years were situated in lower-value added activities and these losses have been more than offset by jobs created in higher-value added manufacturing and the financial and international services sectors. Job losses are always regrettable, and neither the Government nor I ever dismiss the singularity of the impact at a personal and community level, resulting from company closures or relocation and their attendant job losses and the full range of services and assistance provided by the agencies are being made available to the workers affected. I understand that the relocation proposed by this company is part of a greater outsourcing exercise on the part of the parent company Aviva.</P>
        <P>It must be remembered that Ireland also experiences the benefits resulting from globalisation as new markets and business opportunities open up for Irish companies.  The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, remains one of the highest in the world.  While competition from emerging markets for FDI has intensified, Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.  While our relative costs are now higher, we have responded nationally to a changing environment by positioning ourselves as the location for more advanced activities, with more qualified and better paying jobs.</P>
        <P>One of my Department&rsquo;s main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business, and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain. The Programme for Government contains a range of commitments focussed on maintaining and enhancing our framework competitive conditions, and promoting new areas of competitive advantage, including developing our R&amp;D base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures, and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning. Over the period of the National Development Plan the Government will provide total investment of over &euro;25bn with &euro;8.2 billion on the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI) 2006-2013 towards achieving our goal to become a leader in Research &amp; Development and Innovation,  &euro;3.3bn investment specifically to support the development of the indigenous and FDI enterprise base and &euro;13.7bn on skills development.</P>
        <P>In 2007, Forf&aacute;s established a group to look at the challenges and opportunities faced by the services sector. From the work of this group we intend to prepare and position Irish enterprise to adapt to the globalisation of services with the aim of achieving sustainable and competitive services enterprise in Ireland. A report outlining how to maximise the future returns to Ireland from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential, is due to be completed shortly.</P><Col N="305"/>
        <P>We will continue to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and up-skilling to improve labour market flexibility and, where necessary, ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive, should they need to find alternative employment. Investment in our people and ensuring that they have the skills required to live and work in the global knowledge economy is at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to progress towards a knowledge economy and society. Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability, that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy.</P>

	<P>The Board of F&Aacute;S identified the changing employment patterns and future prospects in the Construction / Contracting Sector as a key area in the external environment that could impact on the achievement of F&Aacute;S &ldquo;strategic objectives&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Board established a Sub-committee to oversee the development of a F&Aacute;S contingency plan to meet these changes.  The Sub-committee widely consulted all Stakeholders including relevant Government Departments, State Agencies and the Social Partners.  The Sub-committee&rsquo;s Interim Report was endorsed at the April 2008 F&Aacute;S Board Meeting.</P>
        <P>The interim report includes a number of recommendations in relation to apprenticeship and F&Aacute;S has commenced the implementation process:</P>
        <P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />F&Aacute;S has met with the CIF to discuss the impact  of the slowdown in the Construction Industry on the Apprenticeship Programme.  The CIF agreed to consult with members and to come back to F&Aacute;S with their views and proposals.</P>
        <P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />F&Aacute;S have put into place a register of Redundant Apprentices by Trade in order to identify these people at the earliest possible point of time and F&Aacute;S have prioritised the need to locate an employer to sponsor the completion of the Apprentices &ldquo;off-the-job&rdquo; training.</P>
        <P el="5">3. <Miles com="ix" />As an interim measure, F&Aacute;S now allow redundant apprentices to progress to the next phase of &ldquo;off-the-job&rdquo; tuition without completing the intervening &ldquo;on-the-job&rdquo; training.</P>
        <P el="5">4. <Miles com="ix" />F&Aacute;S have opened discussions with the relevant bodies to explore the most practical way for recognising the &ldquo;on-the-job&rdquo; training and assessment where a redundant apprentice has secured employment abroad.</P>
        <P el="5">5. <Miles com="ix" />F&Aacute;S will not allow employers who make an apprentice redundant to subsequently recruit another apprentice in the same trade before the apprenticeship period of the redundant apprentice has expired</P>
        <P el="5">6. <Miles com="ix" />F&Aacute;S will explore the feasibility of creating new apprenticeships in those highly-skilled occupations which have become extensively required in the Construction Industry (e.g. glazing, insulation).</P><Col N="306"/>

	<P>The Lisbon agenda is aimed at making Europe more competitive and innovative on the world stage. As part of that process, the Barcelona European Council concluded that <Col N="307"/>Europe as a whole should aim to reach a target of 3% of GDP on R&amp;D by 2010, with two thirds of that spend to come from industry.</P>
        <P>The emphasis placed on strengthening research in Europe coincides with the implementation of the most comprehensive plan for investment in science, technology and innovation that has ever taken place in Ireland. Under the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI) 2006-2013, the Government has set a goal for Ireland to become a leader in research and development and innovation and has committed a budget of &euro;8.2 billion under the NDP 2007-2013 towards achieving this goal.</P>
        <P>Ireland has made progress towards the Lisbon R&amp;D target in recent years. Total R&amp;D performance by business, higher education and public sector (GERD) has risen from 1.32% of GNP in 2000 to 1.56% of GNP in 2006, the latest year for which data is available. Despite the down turn in the global economy, this improvement is expected to continue in light of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to develop a knowledge driven economy. The SSTI has set the objective of enhancing performance in R&amp;D with a view to increasing gross expenditure on R&amp;D to 2.5% of GNP by 2013. The achievement of this target will be monitored by my Department over the period of the Strategy.</P>

	<P>The level of Business Expenditure on Research and Development (BERD) has increased from &euro;784 million in 1999, to &euro;900 million in 2001, &euro;1,105 million in 2003, &euro;1,329 in 2005 and &euro;1,560 (estimated) in 2006 (all amounts in 2006 prices).  BERD data is collected biennially, with survey respondents asked to provide expenditure details in respect of the previous year and an estimate of expenditure for the current year.  At the present time, the year 2006 is the most recent year for which data is available. The 2008 biennial BERD survey is expected to commence in the autumn and will provide data for 2007 and an estimate for 2008.</P>
        <P>The level of Business Expenditure on Research and Development has increased by 99% between 1999 and 2006, which is a very satisfactory indication of the impact of Government policies in the area of science, technology and innovation.  The substantial increase in Business Expenditure is a direct result of those policies.</P>

        <P>My Department has responsibility for overseeing and directing the full implementation of the SSTI. It has ensured that the governance structures established to guarantee effective interaction, coordination and review of outputs across eight Government Departments, the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser, state agencies and higher education institutions worked together to implement the Strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the apex of this whole of Government system is the Cabinet Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI), chaired by An Taoiseach.  Its membership is composed of the key stakeholder Ministers.  The Committee&rsquo;s objective is to ensure that the environment for science, technological development and innovation is conducive to maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and to further developing Ireland's  position as a dynamic, knowledge driven economy. Following the publication of the SSTI in June 2006, the Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) on Science, Technology and Innovation, chaired by my Department, has reported to the Cabinet Committee on three occasions to brief members on the progress made in implementing the Strategy.</P>
        <P>I recently presented the draft first report on the implementation of the SSTI to the Cabinet Committee on STI.  The Committee approved the report, which will be published shortly. The report confirms that substantial progress has been made in realising the Strategy&rsquo;s objectives. Highlights from the report include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on R&amp;D had increased from 1.32% of GNP in 2000 to 1.56% of GNP at end 2006;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Higher Education R&amp;D spending has almost quadrupled in current terms over 10 years and is now at the EU and OECD average levels. This investment is having a significant impact in terms of human capital development, attraction of foreign direct investment and commercialisation;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The SSTI target to double the output of PhDs by 2013 is advancing significantly;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The number of Principal Investigator Research teams funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) has been increased from a baseline of 200 in 2005 to 284 by end 2007;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The fourth cycle of the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI), which was announced in August 2007 with an allocation of &euro;230 million, is set to deliver 819 spaces and approximately 600 highly qualified research personnel;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />R&amp;D performed in the business sector (BERD) rose by 17.3% to an estimated &euro;1.56 billion in 2006, almost double the level recorded in 2000. Enterprise Ireland and IDA continue to work closely with companies to strengthen the research and technological base of the enterprise sector to underpin future competitiveness and quality employment and thereby drive forward the target of growing BERD to &euro;2.5 billion by 2013;</P><Col N="309"/>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Solid progress is being made by the Departments of Education and Science; Health and Children; Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in implementing the key actions in their sectoral areas; and</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Overall, I am satisfied that the investment that has been made to date in human capital, physical infrastructure and commercialisation of research will contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the SSTI.

	<P>The amount invested by the Government in R&amp;D activities is calculated by the Forf&aacute;s Science Budget survey which uses agreed OECD guidelines and methodologies. The relevant international indicator for comparative purposes is the GBOARD metric (Government Budget Outlays or Appropriations for R&amp;D).</P>
        <P>The latest data available, as provided in the table, shows that GBOARD in Ireland rose from &euro;290million in 2000 to an estimated &euro;930 million in 2007. This equates to a Government investment in R&amp;D equivalent to 0.58% of GNP, compared to an OECD average of 0.81% of GDP. The OECD civil GBOARD metric, excluding defence activities, estimates the OECD Civil GBOARD intensity ratio at 0.55% of GDP in 2007.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s Green Card Scheme, operated under the Employment Permits Act 2006, is the principal way in which employers can source employees from outside the EEA to meet shortages in a range of highly skilled occupational categories in the Information and Communications Technology, Health Care, Construction, Engineering, Financial Services and Research sectors.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued a total of 4,293 permits under the Green Card Scheme since it began in February 2007. A breakdown of the categories for which these Green Cards have been issued is set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>The work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs assists my Department in keeping under review current and future skills needs, and in addressing identified shortcomings in the skills of various groups in our labour force. In this regard, I would mention recently published reports by the Expert Group for Future Skills Needs on the Medical Devices sector, the ICT sector and the International Financial Services sector. These needs are being addressed through significant investment in upskilling initiatives, including those delivered by F&Aacute;S and Skillnets. <Col N="311"/>These initiatives take the form of specific training programmes for workers to help build the skills levels required in occupational categories currently identified as suitable for Green Cards.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> the plans for making innovation vouchers available in every sector as discussed in the programme for Government; when this expansion of the vouchers will be completed; the cost of such vouchers to the Exchequer; and the estimated monetary benefit from same. </Quest>

	<P>Innovation Vouchers are now available to small businesses in every sector subject to the condition that the applicant is a registered company.  The Innovation Voucher Initiative was introduced in April 2007.  In the 2007 pilot phase of the initiative 428 companies received vouchers with a total grant allocation of &euro;2.14 million.  In the first half of 2008 a further 188 vouchers were awarded with a total value of &euro;940,000 bringing the total allocated fund for this Programme to just over &euro;3m.  The 2008 target for vouchers issued is 400, though of course this is a demand led scheme and therefore the uptake of vouchers is a factor of the response of companies.</P>
        <P>An All Island Innovation Voucher scheme, involving both enterprises and research institutions both North and South, was launched on 27th May 2008. The Programme is being administered jointly by Enterprise Ireland and Invest NI.</P>
        <P>Under this Programme vouchers to the value of &euro;5000 are awarded to companies which will allow them explore a business opportunity or problem with a public research body thereby facilitating knowledge transfer to their business. In addition to the face value of the voucher, there is a 30% allowance of the redeemed value of the voucher, provided to the knowledge <Col N="312"/>providing institution in respect of overhead costs.  The vouchers can be redeemed in an approved higher education institute, including universities and institutes of technology, for work undertaken to progress an idea to a workable concept.</P>
        <P>This Programme offers small enterprises the opportunity to collaborate with an academic institution and could include the assimilation of new technology to meet their particular business needs. In addition to providing support to small enterprises an important impact of the Programme is that it stimulates companies that do not currently engage in research and development to take the first steps in formal product or process improvement and also introduces them to the research facilities available in higher education institutions.  Experience from other countries indicates that this is a very successful way of stimulating innovation in business, and one of the objectives of the scheme is to encourage a change in attitudes to R&amp;D within companies.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> the criteria for being accepted into a community employment scheme; the reason CE schemes are not granted to people in receipt of social welfare credits who are trying to get back into the workforce; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[26978/08]</QRef>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.</P>
        <P>The eligibility criteria and participation limits for CE are set by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE). The qualifying criteria for participation are intended to facilitate the movement of participants through CE, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity, to avail of the programme.</P>
        <P>The criteria for participating on the Community Employment programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments. In general, the Part-time Integration Option is for people of 25 or over who are receiving social welfare payments for 1 year or more, and people of 18 years or over in receipt of disability-related payments. The Part-time Job Option is for people who are 35 or over and in receipt of social welfare payments for 3 years or longer.</P>
        <P>Certain groups such as travellers and refugees aged 18 or over are eligible for both options. If you qualify under the criteria but do not wish to take up the option yourself, there are certain conditions under which you can do a spousal swap.</P>
        <P>The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  F&Aacute;S makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  F&Aacute;S also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</P>
        <P>In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time <Col N="313"/>providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</P>

        <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the number of persons on the live register in Dublin Mid-West has increased by more than a quarter in the past 12 months and now stands at approximately 4,500; if she will take steps to address the severe problem of unemployment in the constituency; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The number of persons on the live register in Dublin Mid-West has increased by over 26% in the last twelve months compared to an increase of 31% in the State overall. The Live Register is not a measure of unemployment as it includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers who might be signing on from time to time.</P>
        <P>Employment/unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey, collated and published by the CSO.  The number of persons in employment in the Dublin region is 627,500 in Quarter 1, 2008 (Dec-Feb 08).  Employment has increased in the Dublin region by 13,300 with unemployment decreasing by 700 in the year.</P>
        <P>Dublin is the Gateway centre of the East Region and continues to grow in terms of foreign direct investment across a range of sectors.  Dublin West continues to be actively marketed by IDA Ireland to potential investors and is well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment, with a third level institute (Tallaght Institute of Technology) and good infrastructural facilities at Citywest and Grangecastle.</P>
        <P>The development of the Grangecastle Business Park by the Council and IDA Ireland, combined with the development of the City West Business Park (which includes the National Digital Park) is an attractive location for high technology state of the art projects, both overseas and indigenous.</P>
        <P>Wyeth/American Homecare Products is located in the business park with the world&rsquo;s largest integrated biotechnology facility on the site. Wyeth announced earlier this year that it is investing a further &euro;24 million in the creation of additional dedicated R&amp;D and process development facilities at its Grangecastle Campus.   Also, Microsoft Corporation has announced that it will locate its 51,000sq metres state-of-the-art data centre in Grange Castle Business Park.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has approved support for the development of Community Enterprise Centres at Neilstown and Bawnogue in the Clondalkin area and Bolbrook, Brookfield and Killinarden in Tallaght totalling over &euro;3.12m. The expansion to the Neilstown Enterprise Centre has also been approved with a grant of &euro;300,000.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has also facilitated the establishment of a Network for Community Enterprise Centre Managers in the region. This association will strengthen the networking of the community groups in the development of their enterprise centres.</P>
        <P>After 3 months on the live register those who are still unemployed are referred by Department of Social and Family Affairs to F&Aacute;S to assist them into training or employment.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S is working through its own Employment Service and with the Local Employment Service provided by Area Based Partnerships to provide increased interviewing and caseload management capacity to respond to the increased numbers on the Live Register.</P><Col N="314"/>
        <P>The range of integrated support services provided by F&Aacute;S also involves information sessions, skills analysis, training/retraining courses and job placement.  These services will be available for those who become redundant because of company restructuring or closures.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S is also implementing a range of short and medium term actions for those affected by the increase in unemployment and the construction slowdown such as:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />putting in place training to upskill construction workers in relation to emerging needs</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />business training and mentoring for workers from larger enterprises entering self-employment</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />developing measures to ensure continuity in the apprenticeship system</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />promoting access for mobile workers to construction jobs elsewhere in the EU, including the UK.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In the delivery of these services, F&Aacute;S liaises with other relevant agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>

        <P>Competitions were held in 2007 for the recruitment of the additional fifty-nine Inspectors provided for under the Social Partnership Agreement Towards 2016.  Fifty-seven inspectors have been assigned to NERA from these competitions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fifty-six of these inspectors have completed the NERA Inspection Services Introductory Training Programme and are currently undertaking further training, including on-the-job training.  This involves working with experienced Inspectors in carrying out inspections and other associated enquiries at places of work with a view to determining compliance with certain employment rights legislation.  A further inspector commenced duty recently and is currently undergoing the NERA Inspection Services Introductory Training Programme.</P>
        <P>Assignment of the two remaining Inspectors selected in the competitions is ongoing and it is intended that these Inspectors will commence training immediately upon arrival.</P>
        <P>Seven of the original 31 Inspectors have left NERA either on promotion or as a result of internal and external Departmental transfers.  As a result, the total number of NERA Inspectors currently stands at eighty-one.</P>

	<P>Payment and repayment of grants are day-to-day operational matters for the Industrial Development agencies and I do not have any role in these matters. However, I understand from Enterprise Ireland that the company in question has not returned any grant aid to the agency.  I am aware that this matter has been complicated by a fire at the Glanbia Fresh Pork plant in Edenderry in 2007 and the management buy-out of the Glanbia Pork Division by Rosderra Irish Meats Group.</P>
        <P>Last month, Rosderra announced an investment of &euro;17 million to reinstate and upgrade the Edenderry plant with the creation of an additional 120 jobs on that site. While I understand that Enterprise Ireland will not provide grant aid to Rosderra for this capital expansion, it is considering reallocating the grant liability previously held by Glanbia Plc on capital investments in Rooskey and Edenderry to the new capital spend of &euro;17 million being made by Rosderra.  Again, I must point out that this issue is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The allocation of individual budgets to the thirty-five County and City Enterprise Boards is carried out by the CEB Central Coordination Unit (CCU) which has been set up within Enterprise Ireland to carry out a number of functions in respect of the CEBs which had been previously <Col N="321"/>undertaken by my Department.  Such functions include the allocation of budgets to individual CEBs for the year and the effective management of available resources to the CEB network in order to maximise sustainable development in the micro-enterprise sector.</P>
        <P>In determining the 2008 allocations for individual CEBs the CCU adopted a systematic approach to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment.  It is a matter for individual CEBs to determine how they will use allocated funds, as well as the &ldquo;own income&rdquo; funds available to them from repayable grants, in the most effective manner possible (subject to meeting the appropriate eligibility criteria and a number of limits and thresholds that are in place). Some Boards may choose to commit all of their available funding as projects present themselves, even if this means that their funding is exhausted relatively early in the year, while others may choose to reserve some funding until later in the year so that they are in a position to support other high quality projects that emerge at that time.  This would explain why some Boards may have utilised their Measure 1 funding earlier in the year than other Boards.</P>
        <P>It is a basic expectation of Boards that they will manage the delivery of their support Programmes on the basis of their allocated amount over the year as a whole.  As with all State-funded assistance, CEBs are expected to prioritise and manage available funding in a targeted and effective manner. While it is vital that CEBs continue to promote and support enterprise development at local level, due to the finite nature of public finances, it is not always possible for a CEB to provide financial assistance to every eligible project that presents itself.  This is an operating reality with which all CEBs are already familiar.</P>
        <P>As part of the normal yearly budgetary cycle, some Boards will request additional funding to support a variety of expenditures beyond their original allocations.  Such requests are made by CEBs in the knowledge that these requests can only be considered should overall additional funding become available.</P>
        <P>As part of the CCU&rsquo;s on-going management of available funding for 2008, the Unit will conduct a review of CEB spending in late Summer.  It has generally been the case that a number of Boards are not in a position to spend all of their annual allocations.  Accordingly, should surplus funding become available, this will be reallocated by the CCU to any Boards that are in a position to spend additional funds, subject to thorough assessment of the rationale and the justification for the level of funding being requested.  It will be in the context of this process that any additional funding requests from individual Boards will be considered.</P>
        <P>Out of the 35 CEBs located around the country, 7 have currently indicated to the CCU that they could utilise additional Measure 1 funding. These seven Boards are Cavan, Cork South, Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown, Kerry, Kildare, Laois and Westmeath.</P>

        <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the fact that most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office show that the south east region has one of the lowest rates of household disposable income and one of the highest rates of long-term unemployment; the measures she proposes to remedy this situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department provides a range of supports to assist unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, lone parents, and sickness related welfare recipients to return to the active labour market either by taking up employment or becoming self-employed.</P>
        <P>The main welfare to work measure for the unemployed is the National Employment Action Plan (EAP).  Under the EAP, people who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the department and referred to F&Aacute;S for interview with a view to job placement or an offer of training.</P>
        <P>Other supports include the operation of the back to education and back to work allowance schemes, the technical assistance and training grants and the PRSI exemption scheme. The activation and family services programme and the second chance education opportunities scheme also offer supports to social welfare recipients and disadvantaged persons to assist them to improve their employability and personal and family situations.</P>
        <P>At present a network of 40 facilitators work closely at local level with social welfare recipients, including those on the live register. There are six facilitators serving the south east region at present. These officers, located in counties Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow, Kildare and Wicklow, work directly with those on Social Welfare in order to determine their needs. They arrange, through direct provision or jointly with other agencies, appropriate training and developmental programmes to equip them to progress to employment, enhance their parenting skills or improve their life opportunities.  It is proposed to enhance the service in the south east region with the assignment of additional facilitators, as part of a wider activation programme provided for under the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>The enhanced facilitation service will build on the Department&rsquo;s existing experience and income maintenance relationship with the people concerned, in co-operation with other relevant service providers such as F&Aacute;S, VECs, HSE and other local agencies.</P>
        <P>The National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 includes a commitment to maintain the relative value of the lowest social welfare rate at least at &euro;185.80, in 2007 terms, over the course of the Plan, subject to available resources. This commitment is reiterated in the Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The value of the lowest rate of welfare payment was fully maintained in Budget 2008 and now stands at &euro;197.80 per week following an increase of &euro;12 per week or over 6%. In the last six Budgets, the value of the lowest rate of payment has increased by a cumulative &euro;79 per week or 67%.</P>
        <P>By any standards, the levels of increases in welfare payments generally over the period since 2002 have been exceptional and are a demonstration of our continuing commitment to all those who are less well off.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 527 and 539 together.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic rate of supplementary welfare allowance, appropriate to his/her family circumstances, less a specified minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many people pay more than &euro;13 because recipients are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have, over and above the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance, towards their accommodation costs. Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that the person concerned was initially in receipt of the maximum amount of rent supplement while in receipt of One-Parent Family payment.  When she took up a F&Aacute;S course, rent allowance was reduced, to take account of additional earnings.  Her entitlement to rent supplement was reviewed following a reduction in her rate of One-Parent Family payment and her rent supplement has now been increased to &euro;367.69 a month.</P>
        <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme (BSCFA) is also administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the HSE. Applications for the allowance may be made between the beginning of June and the end of September each year.  A person may qualify for payment of the allowance if s/he is in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment, is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education or training course and has household income at or below certain specified levels at the time of the application for the allowance.</P>
        <P>Entitlement to the allowance is based on the person&rsquo;s normal weekly income.  In the case in question the Executive has advised that the person concerned does not qualify for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance as her household income is well in excess of the specified limit for her family size.</P>

	<P>The review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was carried out as part of the Government&rsquo;s Expenditure Review Initiative series of Programme Evaluation reviews.  Given the extensive and complex nature of the scheme, the review was undertaken in two phases.  A report was published at the end of the first phase in December 2004.  That report gave a broad appraisal of the scheme and identified issues for particular consideration in the second phase which commenced in February 2005.  This second and final phase of the review, which was published in November 2006, is an in-depth examination which considered the issues raised in phase I of the report, examined the validity of the objectives of the scheme and the efficiency and effectiveness of the scheme.  The report of phase II of the review also provided a series of recommendations in relation to the future of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P><Col N="333"/>
        <P>Overall the review concluded that the scheme has, over the years, met its objective of guaranteeing that every person in the State has a minimum level of income sufficient to meet their basic day to day needs.  However, the review also points out that the scheme has gone beyond its original &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; role and now plays a more extensive role than was originally intended.  In overall terms the main recommendations arising include:</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The creation of a unified system of income support delivered at Social Welfare Local Offices  and complemented by a range of activation supports;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Vigorous support of the Rental Assistance Scheme to address housing needs of people in long-term rent supplementation</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A  continued role for the Community Welfare Service in delivering a flexible and immediate response to those most in need.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A number of measures have been introduced to progress implementation of the recommendations of the review.  For example, Budget 2007 provided for improvements in the qualifying conditions for rent supplement which will support the transfer to the rental accommodation scheme of rent supplement tenants who wish to take up full-time employment.</P>
        <P>The review also identified a number of issues relating to the incentives under the rent supplement scheme for those wishing to take up an employment opportunity.  These issues were addressed in Budget 2007. Since June of 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</P>
        <P>The review also recommended an easing of the means test for supplementary welfare allowance in the assessment of capital.  Budget 2007 provided for an improved capital assessment which presents a less severe approach to the assessment of capital for supplementary welfare allowance purposes.</P>
        <P>The process currently underway to transfer certain functions from the HSE to this Department presents fundamental reform and developmental opportunities for a fully integrated and enhanced income support system, as recommended in the report.  This includes a restructuring and integration of income and wider support services within one entity, namely this Department, while facilitating the HSE in concentrating on its core health and personal social services functions.  The report provides a working template to support the transfer programme.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, the focus of the review was on maximising the achievement of the objectives that have been identified as appropriate to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in an effective and efficient manner.  Over time, the implementation of the recommendations of the review will result in improvements in the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the scheme.</P>

	<P>The Department conducted an internal review of payments to carers during the period 2004 to 2006. The review was designed as a vehicle to build on the review of the carer&rsquo;s allowance which was published in 1998. The review examined all aspects of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant and made a broad range of recommendations covering issues such as the definition of full time care and attention, qualifying conditions for the respite care grant and the operation of the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance. </P>
        <P>Many of the review&rsquo;s recommendations have been implemented in recent Budgets especially in the area of introducing more flexibility in current arrangements.</P>
        <P>The review is now being considered in the context of the development of the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy, the focus of which is on supporting informal and family carers in the community. While social welfare supports for carers are a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment are also important. Co-operation between relevant government departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed. For that reason, an inter-departmental working group, chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach, was established to develop the strategy.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs provides the secretariat to the working group which also includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as F&Aacute;S and the Health Service Executive.  It is intended to publish the strategy later this year.</P>

        <Quest> if income from F&Aacute;S training schemes counts as income when assessing family income supplement entitlements; if it is counted as income, when this rule was introduced; if it was ever the case that income from a F&Aacute;S training scheme was exempt as income for FIS purposes; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P Just="Left">Family income supplement (FIS) is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.  This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.  FIS is paid on a weekly basis over a period of 52 weeks, taking into account a family&rsquo;s net earnings and the number of children under aged 18 or aged between 18 and 22 years and in full time education.</P>
        <P>The FIS scheme is provided for in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) and in the Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims, Payments and Control Regulations 2007) (as amended).</P>
        <P>Within this legislation and these regulations provision is made for the calculation of weekly family income with the disregard of certain items.</P>
        <P>Weekly family income from F&Aacute;S training schemes is not included in the items that are disregarded as income and therefore counts as income. This has always been the position as regards the assessment of income from F&Aacute;S training schemes for FIS purposes.</P>
        <P>Any changes in the income disregards to include a disregard of income from F&Aacute;S Training schemes for FIS purposes would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic rate of supplementary welfare allowance, appropriate to his/her family circumstances, less a specified minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than &euro;13 towards their <Col N="336"/>accommodation costs because recipients are also required to contribute any additional assessable means, including income from employment, other social welfare and maintenance payments that they have, over and above the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that the person concerned is in receipt of her full entitlement to rent supplement when account is taken of income she has from One-Parent Family payment, Jobseekers Benefit and maintenance payments.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 544 and 555 together.</P>
        <P>Spouses working for self-employed contributors are specifically excepted from social insurance contributions. However, spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are thus liable for social insurance contributions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;The role and economic contribution of spouses working on the farm will be better recognised within the social insurance system&rsquo;. On foot of this commitment an information leaflet, &lsquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rsquo;, has been developed between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business. It was published on the 25th of June, 2008.</P>
        <P>The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria. In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI and build up entitlement towards a contributory state pension and other Social Welfare benefits. Application for benefits would take place in the usual way, following approval of an application for commercial partnership status and the payment of any resulting PRSI liabilities.</P><Col N="337"/>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners use the following factors to decide if a partnership normally exists:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />there is a written partnership agreement (a written agreement is not required by law, however);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />each partner writes cheques on the business accounts in their own right;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />there is a joint business account;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />it is apparent to those doing business with the partnership that a partnership exists;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />business accounts and activities are in joint names of the partners;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />each partner makes a significant contribution to the running of the business;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the business is owned jointly by the partnership; the profits and losses of the partnership are shared by each partner;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the business stationery reflects the existence of a partnership. An applicant should meet some of these general criteria if they are claiming to be in a partnership with their spouse.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is not possible to estimate the number of people who may apply for commercial partnership status as a result of this publication. However, it is expected that the leaflet will be of interest to significant numbers of couples operating farms and other small business enterprises.</P>

        <Quest> the amount the Money Advice and Budgeting Service has cost every year since its creation; the number of callers it receives on a monthly basis; the number of staff exclusively employed for this service; if it uses an agency, temporary or consultancy staff; and if there are plans to expand this service in view of recent economic difficulties here. </Quest>

	<P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management operating the service nation-wide. The MABS companies directly employ over 240 staff to provide the service. From time to time, temporary staff are employed by individual companies, using local recruitment arrangements, to cover staff absences such as maternity leave or long term illness.</P>
        <P>The software application (MABSIS) developed to gather information throughout the MABS network was rolled out to all MABS companies during 2005/2006.  The first full year statistics available from the MABSIS show that, in 2007, the MABS provided services to some 12,500 new clients and  approximately 2,600 people sought information about budgeting and money management.  This year, up to the end of June, a total of 8,115 new clients have approached the MABS.  In addition the MABS National Telephone Helpline has, since its launch in October 2007, dealt with over 6,300 calls.</P>
        <P>In 2007  &euro;17.67 million was provided to fund the service and in 2008, almost  &euro;18 million has been provided to assist the MABS in dealing with its work load.</P><Col N="338"/>

        <P>Proposals to extend the free travel scheme to Irish born people living abroad and those receiving pensions from my Department have been examined and, in this regard, officials of the Department have engaged in discussions with EU Commission officials.

        <P>More recently, the European Commission has indicated that to extend the scheme to people in receipt of an Irish pension could also be considered discriminatory.</P>
        <P>The Department is co-ordinating an interdepartmental initiative to develop a public services card.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The ESB Contract Meter Readers were treated as self-employed for Social Insurance / PRSI purposes.  On a number of occasions they have sought to have their employment status changed to that of employee. In 1999 a Deciding Officer, having reviewed their status, decided again that they were self-employed and subject to PRSI at Class S.</P>
        <P>The Meter Readers appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  On the 16th January 2002, after detailed consideration of the evidence, an Appeals Officer considered that there had been significant changes in the terms and conditions of the employment of the Meter <Col N="340"/>Readers since 1994 that materially affected the nature of the employment relationship.  Two key factors were:</P>
        <P el="5">(a) <Miles com="ix" />the introduction of new technology by the ESB (data loggers)</P>
        <P el="5">(b) <Miles com="ix" />the imposition of restrictions on the Meter Readers  sending substitutes to carry out the work.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Appeals Officer concluded that the Contract Meter Readers were employees of the ESB with effect from 1 July 1994 only and liable for PRSI contributions at Class A or J, depending on their level of earnings.</P>
        <P>The ESB challenged this decision in the High Court.  The High Court upheld the decision of the Department.   The ESB has appealed this decision to the Supreme Court.   No date has yet been set for a hearing. Therefore, until the outcome of the Supreme Court challenge is known, the employment status of the Meter Readers must remain in abeyance.</P>
        <P>In the absence of PRSI contributions Meter Readers have no entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or other PRSI-based welfare payments. They may qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if they are unemployed.  However, this allowance is subject to a means test.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 560 to 564, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="344"/>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to question number 365 on the 1st of July 2008, which detailed the position with regard to my Department&rsquo;s Value For Money Reviews under the current round.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the value for Money and Policy Review Initiative is part of a framework introduced to secure improved value for money from public expenditure.  The objectives of the Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative are to analyse Exchequer spending in a systematic manner and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between programmes as opposed to purely quantifying savings. Any recommendations arising from this process are fully considered by my Department.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 592 of 17 June 2008 the reason Waterways Ireland are adopting this position, and no objection was lodged to a previous resurfacing of this roadway at the applicants own expense; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this roadway has been used by a local farmer, their father and grandfather on a daily basis for over 70 years, frequently 30 times a day, and they have no alternative access to their farm; if his further attention has been drawn to the fact that there is a person resident on this roadway; if Water<Col N="346"/>ways Ireland will reverse this decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand from Waterways Ireland that it objected to the Local Improvement Scheme for the roadway in question, which is in its ownership, because it considered that a tarmacadam surface dressing would negatively impact on the rural and aesthetic quality of the canal and lead to increased vehicular traffic and to potential development; it did not object to a previous resurfacing of the roadway as these works reinstated the roadway to its original form, i.e. gravel, which is in keeping with the canal banks along the southerly length of this rural stretch of canal; it is aware that this roadway has been used for many years for agricultural access by a local farmer and his family; and the dwelling to which the Deputy refers is located within 20 metres of a public roadway, which, in the view of Waterways Ireland, means that there is no requirement for a tarmacadam surface dressing.</P>
        <P>In general, Waterways Ireland seeks to maintain the existing rural characteristic of the canal banks with a gravel or grassed surface suitable for agricultural, fishing and other leisure purposes, but which is also sensitive to the aesthetic rural setting. It is satisfied that this policy is in the best interests of the canal environment in that part of its waterways network.</P>

This includes additional ecological surveys, additional civil engineering design and associated revisions to the design plans for the project. When these assessments have been completed, the Environmental Impact Statement can be finalised. Waterways Ireland will then be in a position to make a submission to the planning authorities, which is anticipated to occur by the end of September 2008.  </P>

	<P>The files of the former Land Commission are retained in the Records Branch of my Department, which is currently located in the National Archives Building in Bishop Street. These files have not been formally handed over to the National Archives as they contain title documentation of all land acquired by the former Commission for distribution under the Land Purchase Acts.  My officials regularly access these files to service queries from the public relating to current and past transactions involving the former Land Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Certified copies of title documents are issued to vendors or purchasers, their successors in title or their respective solicitors under Statutory Instrument No 341 of 1939. Access to these documents is also governed by Statutory Instrument No 230 of 1964. Personal and other information contained in the files is also accessible under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts. There are no plans at present to make the files generally available for historical research purposes. However, limited access may be made available following application to the Legal Services Division of my Department.</P>

Following qualitative and quantitative research into local food undertaken by Bord Bia, a guide entitled &ldquo;Selling through Farmers&rsquo; markets, Farm Shops and Box Schemes in Ireland&rdquo; was produced last year to provide practical and in-depth advice for small food producers.</P>
        <P>My Department also actively promotes the development of the organic sector in Ireland. Funding is available for producers under the Organic Farming Scheme, with higher rates applicable to horticulture-only producers. For the in-conversion period, which normally lasts two years, horticultural producers with a minimum of 1 hectare are entitled to &euro;283 per hectare, and &euro;142 per hectare when fully organic.</P>
        <P>My Department also has organic capital on-farm and off-farm grant schemes available for producers and processors. Horticultural producers who extend their operations through to the point of sale, as in box schemes or farm shops, are eligible to apply for funding under these Schemes, which provide grant aid of 40% of the cost up to a maximum grant of &euro;60,000 in the case of on-farm investments and  &euro;500,000 for investments off-farm.</P>

        <P>Specific actions have been taken and initiated in relation to origin labelling of meat and meat products.  As regards beef labelling legislation requiring country of origin labelling of beef has been in place since September 2000.  As this legislation did not cover beef sold by the catering trade my Department in collaboration with the Department of Health and Children to have national legislation enacted in 2006 to require that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is also enforced by the FSAI.</P><Col N="357"/>

	<P>The price paid to pig producers, currently stands at &euro;150/100kgs. This is up 15% on last year and the price has been improving steadily over the past weeks. This positive development for producers has been assisted by the availability of export refunds, which has helped alleviate pressures on the EU market. </P>
        <P>On the matter of advice to pig producers, Teagasc&rsquo;s programme of activities includes a significant element of research in the area of pig nutrition, health and welfare. The main objectives of the advisory function in regard to the pig sector are better profitability and competitiveness based on improved growth rates and this is delivered to producers through farm visits, conferences and newsletters. Teagasc prepared a development strategy for the Irish pig industry that identified the issues facing the sector and an Implementation/Steering Group is being currently set up. This group will consist of a small broadly based group that has the necessary stature and expertise to pursue the recommendations.</P>

This group held its first meeting in June and focused on developing a co-ordinated effort to identify potential market opportunities for the full range of Irish food and beverages, prioritisation of market initiatives and broader access issues.  The Group&rsquo;s initial priority is the identification of new market potential and development of a programme of network support with customised strategies, including, where appropriate, trade missions.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 592 and 606 together.</P>
        <P>The Veterinary Practice Act 2005 substantially reformed regulation of veterinary practice in Ireland, including formal recognition for the first time of the veterinary nursing profession.</P><Col N="360"/>
        <P>The Act provides that day to day regulation of the professions is vested in the Veterinary Council of Ireland in accordance with the principles laid down in the legislation.  This role includes responsibility for determining the standards of education required for registration as a veterinary practitioner or a veterinary nurse (Section 13(2)(d) of the Act).  To assist it in carrying out this role, the Act (Sections 62 and 63) requires the Council to have in place and consult with a Veterinary Education and Training Committee, which Committee must by law include nominees of the Minister for Education and the National University of Ireland.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that, while the Act was signed into law in mid 2005 and that most of its provisions came into effect on 1 January 2006, a three-year lead in period was provided for before registration of veterinary nurses became mandatory.  In addition, special provision is made under the Act for those who had been engaged in the practice of veterinary nursing prior to October 2004, when the then draft legislation was initially brought before the Oireachtas.  This provides that such persons may be provisionally registered by the Council for 5 years to enable them to bring their formal educational qualifications up to the standard set by the Council.</P>
        <P>Given the role assigned by law to the Council in relation to recognition of particular providers of veterinary nursing training, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in such a matter.</P>

	<P>The new Council Regulation establishing a Community System to prevent, deter and eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing achieved political agreement at the recent Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers.  After formal adoption at an upcoming Council, it is intended that the Regulation will come into effect from 1 January 2010.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, detailed rules and procedures for implementation must be drawn up.  This is a complex and wide ranging measure, addressing not only IUU fishing activities but the marketing, import and export of the resulting catches.  For that reason, it will require actions from a number of responsible authorities in each Member State.  My officials will be having discussions with relevant authorities here and putting arrangements in place to ensure the effective delivery of the new controls.</P>
        <P>The amount of illegal fish products imported into the EU each year is estimated at 500,000 tonnes, with a value of &euro;1.1bn or more.  The new catch certification system and other tightening of controls will bring significant benefits for Irish and other EU fishermen when this unfair competition is removed from the market.  Furthermore, the sustainable management of our fish stocks will no longer be undermined by the misreporting or non-reporting of catches.</P>
        <P>I am confident that all of these measures will bring significant benefits which will greatly contribute to the long term viability of the industry for our fishermen, the vast majority of whom operate within the rules.</P>

	<P>The disposal of waste materials in all sectors, including agricultural, is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the first instance.</P>
        <P>The Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, require manufacturers and importers of farm plastics &mdash; that is, silage bale wrap and sheeting &mdash; to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market, or alternatively to contribute to and participate in compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. Since 1997 a silage plastic collection service has been operated by the Irish Farm Films Producers Group (IFFPG), and involves payment of a levy by producers (manufacturers and importers).</P>
        <P>As a temporary measure in order to deal with a backlog on farms, local authorities provided designated facilities where farmers could deposit stockpiled farm plastic free of charge. I understand that these temporary facilities proved popular with farmers and that as a result, the IFFPG have now developed a calendar of some 130 collections nationwide where farmers can deposit bale wrap and silage wrap.  My Department has no involvement in the running or financing of these schemes.</P>

	<P>Integrate Ireland Language and Training Ltd.

IILT envisaged continuing direct tuition for a group of up to 200 programme refugees. My Department accepted that mainstreaming of service provision was appropriate as it accords with the overall approach to provision of services to migrants as set out in &ldquo;Migration Nation&rdquo; &mdash; a statement on integration strategy and diversity management which I recently launched. In doing so the Department decided that all provision should be mainstreamed and provided by VECs as it would be less efficient to seek to continue with a small element of provision by IILT.</P><Col N="367"/>
        <P>The funding allocated to IILT will now be redirected to provide for the continuation of this service through the VEC network. The Irish Vocational Education Association has confirmed that it is happy to cooperate and collaborate with my Department in delivery of necessary English language services. The VEC sector has already developed best practice in ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) provision. The sector is already providing English language services for those whose first language is not English. At present services are provided to over 12,000 people annually which clearly demonstrates the capacity of the VECs in this area. A further advantage of mainstreaming such provision through the VEC sector is the fact that the VECs have a nationwide network across all counties and cities that can readily provide classes where needed in the country using their facilities in schools and centres.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 618 and 619 together.</P>
        <P>A programme of reform and expansion of undergraduate medical education and training commenced in 2006 following the acceptance by the Government of the report entitled &ldquo;Medical Education in Ireland A New Direction&rdquo; (the Fottrell Report) published jointly by the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. The measures being implemented under the programme include an increase in the intake of Irish/EU medical students, changes to the entry criteria for medical courses, the introduction of a graduate entry programme and curriculum reform.</P>
        <P>Progress to date in implementing the reform programme and the recommendations of the Fottrell report is as follows: Increase in the intake of Irish/EU medical students. The Fottrell Report recommended an increase in Irish/EU places in medicine from 305 to 725 over a four year period. The increased intake is being achieved through the provision of an additional 180 undergraduate places and the introduction of a new programme of graduate entry to medicine which will provide 240 places.</P>
        <P>In the 2006/07 academic year, an additional 70 undergraduate places were provided amongst the existing five medical schools and an additional 40 places were provided in the 2007/08 academic year. A further 35 places will be provided in 2008/09 and again, in 2009/10.  Graduate Entry Programme for Medicine: The programme of graduate entry to medicine commenced in the academic year 2007/08 with 60 new places created. A further 60 graduate places will be provided in the 2008/09 academic year, the graduate stream will grow to 240 places by 2010/2011. This includes 95 places in a new medical school which has been established at the University of Limerick, bringing the total number of medical schools to six: New selection mechanism for entry to undergraduate medicine. The reforms in medical education which have been agreed with the universities and the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland include a new entry mechanism to undergraduate medical education to be introduced from 2009 to replace the current selection system. The new selection process will be open to all students who achieve <Col N="368"/>a threshold level of 480 points and meet matriculation requirements. In addition it will include a medical school admissions test that complements the Leaving Certificate examination by assessing a range of general and personal skills and competencies. Weighted credit will be given for performance in the Leaving Cert up to 550 points, with significantly moderated credit for any points above 550.</P>
        <P>The new selection criteria are designed to provide students who reach the threshold of 480 points in the Leaving Certificate with a reasonable prospect of achieving the entry standard based on strong performance in the admission test.   The admissions test, selected by the Irish Medical Schools is called the HPAT-Ireland (Health Professions Admissions Test-Ireland). This test is independently administered by ACER (Australian Council for Educational Research). Curriculum Reform: Significant progress has been made by the medical schools in implementing the  Fottrell report recommendation that each medical school should have a structured medical programme with defined programme outcomes, quality assurance mechanisms and addressing the issues such as safe patient care, professional standards and development. To date &euro;7.5m has been allocated to the medical schools for the purposes of curriculum reform. Academic clinicians: To date, funding has been provided for the additional appointment of 25 academic clinician posts on a 50:50 basis between the HEA and the HSE.  The posts cover a wide range of specialities, including clinical pharmacology, medicine for the elderly, respiratory medicine, general practice, public health medicine, accident and emergency medicine, palliative medicine, nephrology and anaesthesia.  Revised contractual arrangements for academic consultants have been agreed as part of the recently finalised consultant&rsquo;s contract negotiations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 621 and 664 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</P>
        <P>Many children with autism are fully integrated into mainstream classes. The National Council for Special Education provides additional resource teaching hours and special needs assistant support to schools in respect of fully integrated enrolled students with autism.</P>
        <P>Some students with autism require further support in school. The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for these children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 315 classes, an increase of 106 since May 2007, have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will continue to establish more classes as required.</P>
        <P>Children in these classes benefit from having a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1; fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and there is a minimum of 2 special needs assistants in each class. Other special needs assistant posts may be allocated in line with the needs of the enrolled children. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</P>
        <P>My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service. A recent initiative has been the expansion of this service to enable it to recruit a behavioural specialist support team, led by a person with a PhD in ABA.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s home tuition scheme provides a grant to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children with Special Educational Needs awaiting an educational placement and provide early education intervention for pre-school children who have been assessed as having autism. The grant provides for ten hours&rsquo; home tuition per week for each child with autism aged between 2.5 and 3 years of age. This increases to twenty hours&rsquo; per week on the child&rsquo;s 3rd birthday.</P><Col N="370"/>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from primary, special and post primary schools for special needs supports on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The SENOs operate within the policy outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circulars for allocating such support.</P>
        <P>Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. All schools have contact details of their local SENO. It is also open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is aware of the Programme for Government commitment to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable them to be supported as primary schools for children with autism. As discussions in this regard are ongoing between officials in my Department and groups representing the centres participating in the scheme he will appreciate that I can not comment further on this issue.</P>

	<P>Integrate Ireland Language and Training Ltd. (IILT) approached my Department earlier this year with a proposal to withdraw from direct tuition for adult refugees and with a request that this tuition be mainstreamed. IILT envisaged continuing direct tuition for a group of up to 200 programme refugees. My Department accepted that mainstreaming of service provision was appropriate as it accords with the overall approach to provision of services to migrants as set out in &ldquo;Migration Nation&rdquo; &mdash; a statement on integration strategy and diversity management which I recently launched. In doing so the Department decided that all provision should be mainstreamed and provided by VECs as it would be less efficient to seek to continue with a small element of provision by IILT.</P>
        <P>The funding allocated to IILT will now be redirected to provide for the continuation of this service through the VEC network. The Irish Vocational Education Association has confirmed that it is happy to cooperate and collaborate with my Department in delivery of necessary English language services. The VEC sector has already developed best practice in ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) provision. The sector is already providing English language services for those whose first language is not English. At present services are provided to over 12,000 people annually which clearly demonstrates the capacity of the VECs in this area. A further advantage of mainstreaming such provision through the VEC sector is the fact that the VECs have a nationwide network across all counties and cities that can readily provide classes where needed in the country using their facilities in schools.</P>

	<P>Class size data for primary schools for 2007/2008 are currently being compiled by my Department and are not yet available. The source of this data is the Annual Census of Primary Schools. Data will become available when returns for all schools have been processed.</P><Col N="372"/>
        <P>The Programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position in relation to the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.</P>
        <P>The Programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes.</P>
        <P>Budget 2008 provided my Department with &euro;4.6 billion or &euro;380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions. This was a very substantial level of additional investment in the terms of the economic environment on which the budget was based. That allocation provides for paying for over 2000 extra primary teachers more than the number in schools when the Government took office last Summer. It covers the additional teachers that went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a 27 to 1 based staffing schedule along with additional teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments, to provide for special needs and the language requirements of newcomer children.</P>
        <P>This means that in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4000 additional teachers the Government in its first two years in office will be well ahead of target.</P>
        <P>All Programme for Government commitments to improve public services including those relating to class size are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management. Even since the presentation of Budget 2008 last December there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment. In that context any reasonable observer would regard the fact that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of over 2000 additional teachers to primary schools as a considerable investment all things considered.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative is part of a framework introduced to secure improved value for money from public expenditure. The objectives of the Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative are to analyse Exchequer spending in a systematic manner and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between programmes. It is one of a range of modernisation initiatives aimed at moving public sector management away from the traditional focus on inputs to concentrate on the achievement of results.  </P>
        <P>Value for Money Reviews are undertaken under the aegis of steering committees which are representative of the Departments/Offices managing the programmes/areas being reviewed.</P>
        <P>In the early 2000&rsquo;s my Department&rsquo;s Planning and Building Unit revised the manner in which the School Capital Programme was delivered and concluded that it was necessary to introduce a mechanism that would increase the deliverable infrastructures in a speedy, cost effective and qualitative manner to ensure improved educational facilities nationally. The Small Schools Initiative and the Permanent Accommodation Initiative were introduced on a pilot basis in the School Capital Programme 2003. Both of the initiatives were the subject of an expenditure review based on the 2003 programme. The review concluded that the initiatives&rsquo; objectives were satisfactorily achieved. These included: the schools involved have better school facilities and/or additional school accommodation; the introduction of these initiatives ensured that the Department was in a position to address the higher priority banded projects through the traditional method of architectural design in the knowledge that 40 additional schools were progressing to construction within a timeframe of 12 months with no hands-on requirement from my officials; a higher output was achieved, as none of the schools in the SSI would have progressed to construction in 2003 if the initiatives were not put in place; a high level of quality was obtained in relation to the projects progressed through the introduction of the PAI; the majority of the building projects proceeded to site and construction within the 12 months timeframe as dictated in the guidelines of each initiative; the majority of the building works completed were of good quality and deemed to provide VFM; School Management Authorities (SMAs), on average, were happy with their own abilities to progress their own building projects. 81% of SMAs would recommend acceptance of the devolved initiatives again 100% were satisfied with the educational impact achieved, 97% were satisfied with the programme of delivery and 93% satisfied with the autonomy Role of SMA; Compliance with public procurement was achieved in relation to the tendering process for building Contractors.</P>
        <P>The devolved Summer Works Scheme was introduced in 2004. The value for money review of the primary and post-primary summer works scheme is not due to be officially completed until late 2008 and consequently any outcomes will not be known for some time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 632, 663, 668, 753 and 757  together.</P>
        <P>The changes to which the Deputies refer arise from a Value for Money Review of the ICT Support Services which was undertaken by my Department and which will shortly be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The review concluded that while the service is generally effective and efficient,  the resources currently utilised by the ICT Advisory Service operating from the regional Education Centres would be better employed focussing supports for ICT leadership and change within each school.  The review highlights the need to ensure that the integration of ICT is specifically incorporated into all support service activities funded by my Department and that ICT is recognised as an integral part of all curriculum development, support and training rather than an optional add-on.</P>
        <P>There are three vacancies among the 21 ICT Advisor posts attached to the regional full-time Education Centres.  A further post is due to be vacated in September following the retirement of an ICT advisor.  Of the remaining 17 posts, 14 are filled by teachers on secondment from their teaching duties and three are filled on a non-secondment contract basis.  These posts have been renewed annually.  Against this background, the Education  Centres have been informed by the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, that my Department is not prepared to renew secondment arrangements for the 14 teachers seconded as ICT advisors.   The NCTE has discussed the implementation of these arrangements with the Education Centres and schools concerned and my Department has met with the teacher unions.  My Department will ensure that any difficulties arising in specific schools due to the return of the teachers concerned will be addressed.  The position of the three non-seconded ICT advisors is under consideration.</P><Col N="376"/>
        <P>I have received correspondence regarding this matter and my Department has met with the teacher unions in relation thereto.   The annual cost of the 14 seconded teachers is some &euro;1.3m.  It is intended that any consequential savings will be directed to support ICT in schools.  The NCTE will continue to provide advice and support to schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning and will continue to provide a range of ICT continuing professional development courses for teachers.  The NCTE will work closely with the support services supported by my Department. The role of the school&rsquo;s ICT coordinating teacher, with the support of the school principal, will be prioritised as central in the provision of ongoing ICT support and advice to teachers. Local school-based and peer to peer support has been identified internationally as the most effective way to further ICT integration in schools. This emphasis on &ldquo;in-school&rdquo; promotion of, and support for, ICT integration in learning and teaching is consistent with both the report of the Strategy Group, appointed to advise on the priorities for investment in ICT in Schools and the evaluation report undertaken by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate on the impact of ICT on teaching and learning. These reports will be published shortly.</P>

	<P>The Value For Money Review of the Youthreach and Senior Traveller Training Centre (STTC) programmes funded by the Department of Education and Science has been completed and was published on the Department&rsquo;s website in April 2008.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the Value For Money Review were wide ranging and included the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Determine if the aims and objectives were still relevant and if they are compatible with the overall strategy of the Department</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Evaluate the level and trend of costs and staffing resources associated with each programme and comment on the efficiency with which each programme has achieved its objectives</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Evaluate if the programmes are providing for the needs of the targeted groups and if the programmes&rsquo; objectives have been achieved in an efficient and effective manner</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Evaluate the appropriateness of the educational provision in the programmes.</P><Col N="377"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Provide recommendations for the future and in particular recommend if the programmes &mdash; current or adapted &mdash; warrant the continued allocation of public funding on a current and ongoing basis.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">While the achievement of savings was an element of the Review, in general it focused on the efficiency and effectiveness with which the programmes used their resources to achieve their stated objectives.</P>
        <P>Overall, the Review provides a basis for supporting the argument for the continued allocation of public funding to Youthreach.  For STTCs, the Review recommended that in the longer term they should be phased out as a segregated provision and adult travellers should participate in mainstream further education with their peers.</P>
        <P>The Review found that both programmes were effective in recruiting their target group and in addressing learners&rsquo; needs for personal and social development. However, it also found that there was room for improvement in terms of the number of learners on both programmes who obtain certification, as well as the levels at which they obtain certification.</P>
        <P>The Review recommended that Youthreach should cater for early school leavers aged 16 to 20 years, while the STTCs should cater for adults aged 18 years and older.</P>
        <P>My Department is actively considering these recommendations and preliminary work on their implementation has commenced.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Among the priority funding measures approved for support in 2006/2007 under the Educational Disadvantage category of the Dormant Account Fund and the RAPID Leverage Fund was a scheme focusing on edu<Col N="379"/>cational infrastructure in disadvantaged schools. Eligibility for the scheme was restricted to primary and post primary schools participating in my Department&rsquo;s DEIS programme; schools in, or serving, RAPID areas; and special schools.</P>
        <P>The scheme consists of four measures and a number of sub-measures. The four measures are: Outdoor Play Facilities; Libraries; Parent Rooms; and Dining Areas and Canteen Equipment. Schools were allowed to submit prioritised proposals under each of the measures.  A total of &euro;24.5 million has been made available to fund the scheme. All four measures of the scheme were heavily oversubscribed.</P>
        <P>The school referred to by the Deputy submitted three prioritised proposals; Priority 1 Library Enhancement, Priority 2 Dining Area Enhancement and Priority 3 Outdoor Play Facilities. The school was successful in securing a grant under the Outdoor Play Facilities measure and has been recommended for funding under the Dining Area and Canteen Equipment measure. However, the school was not successful in securing funding for its library enhancement proposal. My officials recently wrote to the school to advise them that their library enhancement proposal was not successful. The position, in essence, is that all of the Priority 1 library enhancement proposals received were assessed and ranked in accordance with the criteria for the scheme. However, there was insufficient funding available to fund all of the Priority 1 proposals.</P>
        <P>The position relating to the Dining Area and Canteen Equipment projects, including the proposal from the school in question, is under consideration and my Department will be in contact with the school authorities as soon as a decision has been taken.</P>

	<P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999 outlines clear and specific functions for further education and training providers in relation to establishing quality in further education and training.</P>
        <P>When it was established in 2001, the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) adopted all the processes of the former awarding bodies and the National Council for Vocational Awards (NCVA); including those relating to assessment. These processes are being gradually replaced by broader and more rigorous procedures based on FETAC policies.  Following extensive consultation with key stakeholders, including providers, all  FETAC&rsquo;s policies were agreed by the Council by March 2006.  These include: publication of award standards and assessment guidelines; provider quality assurance and national monitoring.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2008, all providers registered with FETAC have rigorous procedures in relation to quality in place and which are now being monitored by FETAC.</P>
        <P>The Qualifications Act specifically establishes a distinct function for FETAC and providers in relation to assessment.  The function of FETAC is to ensure that providers establish procedures for the assessment of learners which are fair and consistent and for the purpose of compliance with standards determined by the Council.</P>
        <P>FETAC in partnership with key stakeholders, has developed guidelines, to assist providers in the development and implementation of procedures for fair and consistent assessment.  These guidelines are available since May 2007.  The guidelines set out the role and responsibility of the provider with regard to quality assuring all aspects of their assessment practice.</P>
        <P>As outlined in its monitoring policy, FETAC will monitor providers&rsquo; activities on an ongoing basis, including those relating to assessment and authentication of results, to ensure consistent application of the requirements and to safeguard the integrity of FETAC awards.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Summer Works Scheme has, since its introduction just a few years ago, transformed the standard of existing school accommodation. With over 3,000 projects now having been funded under the scheme, the Department&rsquo;s intention is to concentrate the investment in school buildings this year on delivering as many large projects as possible.</P>
        <P>While there will be a focus on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also be delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. The emphasis, however, will be on new schools, extensions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects. At primary level schools may use their devolved minor works grant to address such works.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, there will not be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of the Department&rsquo;s building programme in 2008. This being the case, details in relation to the type of project and the estimated cost has not been collated by the Department. I would also advise the Deputy that it is my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.</P><Col N="381"/>

	<P>Integrate Ireland Language and Training Ltd. (IILT) approached my Department earlier this year with a proposal to withdraw from direct tuition for adult refugees and with a request that this tuition be mainstreamed. IILT envisaged continuing direct tuition for a group of up to 200 programme refugees. My Department accepted that mainstreaming of service provision was appropriate as it accords with the overall approach to provision of services to migrants as set out in &ldquo;Migration Nation&rdquo; &mdash; a statement on integration strategy and diversity management which I recently launched. In doing so the Department decided that all provision should be mainstreamed and provided by VECs as it would be less efficient to seek to continue with a small element of provision by IILT.</P>
        <P>The funding allocated to IILT will now be redirected to provide for the continuation of this service through the VEC network, including the service provided by IILT in Galway. The Irish Vocational Education Association has confirmed that it is happy to cooperate and collaborate with my Department in delivery of necessary English language services. The VEC sector has already developed best practice in ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) provision. The sector is already providing English language services for those whose first language is not English. At present services are provided to over 12,000 people annually which clearly demonstrates the capacity of the VECs in this area. A further advantage of mainstreaming such provision through the VEC sector is the fact that the VECs have a nationwide network across all counties and cities that can readily provide classes where needed in the country using their facilities in schools and centres.</P>
        <P>In relation to the employment contracts of staff employed by IILT, including staff in Galway, the position is that IILT is a limited company registered under the Companies Acts and has commenced the process of voluntary liquidation and will cease operation.  As part of this process, the staff of IILT will receive their statutory redundancy entitlements. The employment contracts of IILT staff will not be taken over by the Vocational Education Committees.</P>

	<P>In relation to the fire damage at the school to which the Deputy refers, I understand the school authorities are pursuing the refurbishment with their Insurance Company and my Department has no involvement in grant-aiding same.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents which sets the benchmark for low energy design in schools are clearly focused on energy efficiency and are based on solid energy research projects.</P>
        <P>Solar power for hot water generation is not considered an optimum design solution for Primary schools due to the typical school operation profile (closed during summer months, mid terms etc, short days and closed at weekend), and the minimum and irregular hot water demand which is reduced to minimum by blended percussion spray taps.</P>
        <P>It has been demonstrated that all Primary Schools designed and built in line with the above policy and the technical guidance documents can have an energy performance that is 2.3 times more efficient than International best practice.</P>
        <P>The performance of my Department in the area of low energy design has been recognised at both National and international level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification and just recently by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Public Service Excellence Awards held in Dublin Castle Conference Centre on Friday, 18th April 2008.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, DEIS provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The DEIS plan also states that as well as provision being made for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, a measure of financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.</P><Col N="384"/>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of the Department and was supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate. A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools who applied for the review in August, 2006.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification and review process, 873 schools have been included in DEIS. These comprised 670 primary schools (338 urban schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools. The next identification process is scheduled to be held in 2010.</P>
        <P>In the interim, the Department has put in place separate arrangements for new schools (including those created through amalgamation), which opened in 2005/2006 or thereafter up to the time of the next identification process in 2010.</P>
        <P>The Department has also proposed to review, before the end of 2008, the situation of schools located in certain communities that have experienced significant socio-economic decline since the commencement of DEIS. This review will focus on a small number of communities which have experienced very significant changes since the commencement of DEIS in 2005.</P>

	<P>My Department provides grant-aid towards the provision of temporary school accommodation to the management authorities of education providers where it is established that a need for such temporary accommodation exists.</P>
        <P>Generally, where primary schools require temporary accommodation, the Board of Management is responsible for acquiring temporary accommodation and the rental contract is between the Board of Management and the supplying contractor. My Department provides grant-aid to the individual school authorities towards the costs of procuring the accommodation. Such grant-aid is paid at a rate of 95% for schools with permanent recognition and 75% for schools with provisional recognition. Schools are expected to pay a local contribution of the balance, with an annual threshold on the local contribution of &euro;3,175.</P>
        <P>Expenditure on the rental of temporary accommodation at primary level for 2007 was &euro;34.5 million.  The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department and given the number of payments involved it would require a very large amount of staff time to assemble.</P>

        <Quest> the position in relation to services for autistic children in the west Wicklow area; the pre-school facilities available in the area; if ABA is available in the area, the services that are available; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</P>
        <P>Many children with autism are fully integrated into mainstream classes. The National Council for Special Education provides additional resource teaching hours and special needs assistant support to schools in respect of fully integrated enrolled students with autism.</P>
        <P>Some students with autism require further support in school. The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for these children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 315 classes, an increase of 106 since May 2007, have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools. 11 of these are in Co Wicklow and they include 3 early intervention classes for children of pre-school age who have been diagnosed with autism. The National Council for Special Education will continue to establish more classes as required.</P>
        <P>Children in these classes benefit from having a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1; fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and there is a minimum of 2 special needs assistants in each class. Other special needs assistant posts may be allocated in line with the needs of the enrolled children. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</P>
        <P>My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service. <Col N="386"/>A recent initiative has been the expansion of this service to enable it to recruit a behavioural specialist support team, led by a person with a PhD in ABA.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s home tuition scheme provides a grant to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children with Special Educational Needs awaiting an educational placement and provide early education intervention for pre-school children who have been assessed as having autism.</P>
        <P>The grant provides for ten hours&rsquo; home tuition per week for each child with autism aged between 2.5 and 3 years of age.  This increases to twenty hours per week on the child&rsquo;s 3rd birthday.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from primary, special and post primary schools for special needs supports on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The SENOs operate within the policy outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circulars for allocating such support.</P>
        <P>Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. All schools have contact details of their local SENO. It is also open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes.</P>
        <P>Budget 2008 provided my Department with &euro;4.6 billion or &euro;380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions. This was a very substantial level of additional investment in the terms of the economic environment on which the budget was based. That allocation provides for paying for over 2000 extra primary teachers more than the number in schools when the Government took office last summer. It covers the additional teachers that went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a 27 to 1 based staffing schedule along with additional teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments, to provide for special needs and the language requirements of newcomer children.</P>
        <P>This means that in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4000 additional teachers the Government in its first two years in office will be well ahead of target.</P>
        <P>All Programme for Government commitments to improve public services, including those relating to class size, are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management. Even since the presentation of Budget 2008 last December there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment. In that context any reasonable observer would regard the fact that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of over 2000 additional teachers to primary schools as a considerable investment, all things considered.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the cost pressures on schools and it is for this reason that it is a priority for Government to improve funding for the day-to-day running costs of schools.</P>
        <P>Specific commitments in relation to improving school funding form a central part of the education provisions of the Programme for Government. These commitments are a direct fol<Col N="388"/>low-on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of schools and primary schools in particular.</P>
        <P>Primary schools are now getting over &euro;178 per pupil to meet their day to day running costs &mdash; an increase of nearly 70% on the 2002 rate of &euro;105 and &euro;15 more per child than they got last year.</P>

        <P>The school referred to by the Deputy applied for and was approved grant-aid of &euro;300,000 for the provision of resource rooms under the Permanent accommodation scheme 2007. The Scheme allows Boards of Management to address their accommodation and building priorities <Col N="389"/>with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives Boards of Management control of the building project.</P>
        <P>The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects. The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fund-raising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding. A central tenet of the scheme is that the schools, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensuring value for money. The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.</P>

        <P>Under the terms of the Higher Education Grant Scheme a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for Government commits to ensuring early intervention for pre-school children with special educational needs. This commitment is being addressed in the context of the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004 (EPSEN Act) and the Disability Act 2005. My Department is now at an advanced stage in finalising proposals to facilitate implementation of the remaining sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004.</P>
        <P>The time taken to finalise proposals reflects the complexities involved, the need for consultation across the wide range of people and sectors involved, the need to align with the require<Col N="391"/>ments of the Disability Act, 2005 and define how the Health Service Executive (HSE) and NCSE will work together under both acts. This approach will allow for the co-ordinated delivery of services across the education and health sectors.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.</P>
        <P>My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2008, the standard per capita grant was increased by &euro;15 per pupil and now amounts to &euro;331 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of &euro;15 per pupil in 2008 in the support services grant bringing that grant to &euro;204 per pupil.</P>
        <P>The cumulative increase of &euro;30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to &euro;535 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;300,000.</P>
        <P>Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector along with those in the VEC sector are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.</P>
        <P>These significant increases in the funding of post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. My Department will be considering how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level, as envisaged in the Programme for Government 2007-2012, having regard to available resources.</P>

        <Quest> the extent of special needs teaching required and available to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; if their parents have had contact from his Department with a view to catering for their child&rsquo;s ongoing education and special needs in the future with a view to a place in a school or alternative with ABA and occupational therapy facilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</P>
        <P>Many children with autism are fully integrated into mainstream classes. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) provides additional resource teaching hours and special needs assistant support to schools in respect of fully integrated enrolled students with autism.  Some students with autism require further support in school.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for these children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 315 classes, an increase of 106 since May 2007, have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools. The NCSE will continue to establish more classes as required.</P>
        <P>Children in these classes benefit from having a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1; fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and there is a minimum of 2 special needs assistants in each class. Other special needs assistant posts may be allocated in line with the needs of the enrolled children. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial inclusion and interaction with other pupils.</P>
        <P>My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service. A recent initiative has been the expansion of this service to enable it to recruit a behavioural specialist support team, led by a person with a PhD in ABA.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from primary, special and post primary schools for special needs supports on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The SENOs operate within the policy outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circulars for allocating such support.</P>
        <P>Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. All schools have contact details of their local SENO. It is also open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs.  The NCSE has advised that the parents of the child in question are in contact with the local SENO and that a placement has been identified. The provision of occupational therapy is a matter for the HSE.</P>

	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the junior school in this area. </P>
        <P>The position generally is that schools have flexibility in the way in which they assign pupils and teachers to classes and my Department does not allocate teachers to specific classes or age groups. The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P>
        <P>Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a Principal and 6 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 173 pupils at 30th September 2006.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 177 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will be a Principal and 6 mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>The Board of Management of the school submitted an application seeking the appointment of one additional mainstream class teacher for September 2008 under developing school criteria.</P><Col N="394"/>
        <P>Provisional sanction for the 7th mainstream class teacher was given by the Primary Payments Section of my Department in a letter to the Chairperson on 28th April 2008 based on a projected enrolment of 197 pupils.</P>
        <P>The projected enrolment for September 2008 will be reviewed in October 2008. It will be necessary for the Board of Management to confirm in writing to Primary Payments Section the actual enrolment achieved in the school on 30th September 2008. The letter must reach Primary Payments Section within 5 days of 30th September 2008.</P>
        <P>In the event that the projected enrolment is not reached it is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to a document sent by County Meath Vocational Educational Committee to the planning section of his Department in October 2007 that outlines the second level schooling needs for Navan, County Meath; his plans to address the issues raised in this document and for the possible expansion of existing post primary schools in the Meath VEC area; if he has approved the acquisition of sites in Navan for the provision of additional new post primary schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in any given area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places. This approach ensures that the use of existing accommodation is maximised and that the development and support of one school over others does not occur. </P>
        <P>As part of the Programme for Government, a Developing Areas Unit was set up recently in the Department to focus on the school accommodation needs of rapidly developing areas. The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In addition the Forward Planning Section of the Department is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards, including Navan.</P>
        <P>Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.</P>
        <P>As is the case with all large capital projects currently on hand within the Department, their progression will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if a person (details supplied) in County Meath has received an assessment by the National Educational Psychological Service; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have confirmed with staff in my National Educational Psychological Service that there is no request on hand from school authorities in relation to the assessment of the child named in the question.  May I suggest that the matter be raised by his parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school in question. The  NEPS psychologist assigned to the school will discuss the child&rsquo;s situation with the Principal in early September.  The matter of the provision of speech and language therapy is a matter for the relevant local HSE service.</P>

        <P>Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy indicate that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 35 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year is a Principal and 1 mainstream class teacher.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted by the Board of Management the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 45 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will remain a Principal and 1 mainstream class teacher.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP). </P>
        <P>The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of the Department of Education and Science and was supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate. A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant <Col N="439"/>identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification and review process, 873 schools were included in the SSP under the DEIS initiative. These comprised 670 primary schools (338 urban schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second level schools. The school referred to by the Deputy was not identified for inclusion in DEIS nor did it make an application for a review.</P>
        <P>The DEIS plan states that as well as provision being made for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools, not identified for inclusion in DEIS, where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the school referred to will continue to receive financial support in line with the level of disadvantage among its pupils for the duration of the DEIS action plan. The next identification process is scheduled to be held in 2009/2010.</P>

        <P>The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects. The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fundraising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding. A central tenet of the scheme is that the schools, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensuring value for money. The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.</P>

	<P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes.  One scheme is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.  This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.  This scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme referred to as the Ancillary Services grant.</P>
        <P>The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school. The scheme is flexible by nature, giving Boards of Management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in the level of funding provided to primary schools for this purpose in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of the Ancillary Services grant has increased from &euro;38.09 per pupil to &euro;151.50 per pupil at present.</P>
        <P>The school in question has received the Ancillary services grant for 2008.</P>
        <P>This Government has shown a strong commitment to improving primary school funding in recent years and I will continue to prioritise this area in the context of available resources.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P>
        <P>Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy indicate that the pupil enrolment figures on 30th September for the past three years are as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2004 264</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2005 266</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2006 261</P><Col N="443"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year is a Principal and 10 mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted by the Board of Management the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 229 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will be a Principal and 8 mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>The staffing schedule allocates teachers within enrolment bands and the current bands are based on an average of 27 pupils. While the schedule allocates on the basis of an average each individual school decides how to arrange its classes. Where it is possible, Principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having particularly large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.  Multi-grade classes are the norm in the majority of our primary schools given the number of relatively small schools that have 4 teachers or less and there is no evidence whatsoever that being taught in a multi-grade setting is to the detriment of the child.</P>
        <P>It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The first meeting of the Appeal Board to consider applications for the 2008/09 school year took place on 20th May, 2008.  Another meeting will be held in October, 2008 and the closing date for receipt of appeals is 10 October. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>I am very much aware of the cost pressures on schools, including those arising from waste charges and the changes that are happening in relation to water charges.</P>
        <P>Primary schools are now getting over &euro;178 per pupil to meet their day to day running costs &mdash; an increase of nearly 70% on the 2002 rate of &euro;105 and &euro;15 more per child than they got last year. Post-primary schools have also seen improvements in funding and through a similar &euro;15 increase this year now receive &euro;331 per pupil. These increases are significant and well ahead of the Consumer Price Index increases for the same period.</P>
        <P>With regard to waste charges, there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to examine the feasibility of introducing waste allowances for schools. The progression of this commitment is primarily a matter for my colleague &mdash; the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. My predecessor was in contact with Minister Gormley on this issue and my Department will of course input to and support as required any work being done by that Department on the commitment.</P>
        <P>The position in relation to water charges is that the Government agreed a transition period to full water charges in the case of non-fee charging recognised schools and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has advised local authorities of the detailed arrangements regarding the implementation of this decision.</P>
        <P>The transitional arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place water conservation arrangements and practices and to undertake works that can help reduce water usage significantly before full water charges are introduced.  By virtue of good water conservation schools can be in a much stronger position to reduce the impact of water charges on their overall budgets. Guidance was also recently issued to schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists. In addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>My Department remains in close liaison with the Department of Environment and Local Government regarding water conservation and is supportive of any initiatives by it and local authorities that will help reduce water costs for schools.</P><Col N="445"/>
        <P>The funding needs of schools generally, and what support I can give them to help them meet day to day running costs, is of course a matter that I will be considering in the context of next years estimates.</P>

        <Quest> if he will introduce a curriculum for information technology studies for junior or leaving certificate to reflect how central these subjects are to students and working life today; the amount spent on the IT equipment in secondary schools every year for the past five years; if all schools have access to broadband; and if he will make a statement on the role of IT within education here. </Quest>
        <QRef>[27424/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The curriculum in schools is devised on the basis that ICT is not a subject but rather a tool to be integrated into the teaching and learning of all subjects.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment. This sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education, and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum. It will be supported by a website which will provide exemplars of teaching and learning in different settings, and show the classroom application of learning outcomes and demonstrations in the ICT framework. The overall implementation of ICT in schools is supported by the National Centre for Technology in Education which provides for extensive training and guidance for schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning.</P>
        <P>The information sought by the Deputy regarding the amount spent on IT equipment in secondary schools is not readily available. The latest Census on ICT Infrastructure in Schools undertaken by the NCTE in 2005 asked schools to report on the amount spent on ICT, in addition to any specific grants received from my Department.  The report found that the average annual expenditure per post-primary school of those schools that responded was &euro;11,583.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s building unit provides ICT equipment budgets to all major post-primary school building projects. Grants have also been provided to some 500 post-primary schools to upgrade their facilities to enable them to provide the new Technology syllabus and the revised Design and Communication Graphics syllabus at Leaving Certificate level, with effect from September 2007.  Disadvantaged schools are also benefiting from the small scale ICT Grant scheme for Schools participating in the School Support Programme under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) from the Dormant Accounts (Educational Disadvantage) Fund.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department also has a specific ICT in Schools Programme which promotes the integration of ICT into teaching and learning in our schools.  Since its introduction in 1998, almost &euro;200m has been invested in the Programme.  The two recent investment priorities under the Programme have been the provision of networking grants to schools and the Schools Broadband Access Programme. Schools were invited to submit proposals for the development of their networking capability in June 2004 and grants in excess of &euro;23m have since issued to schools. Some &euro;9m of this investment has issued to 660 post-primary schools, giving an average grant in the region of &euro;13,000.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of broadband connectivity to all recognised schools is being undertaken in partnership with industry, in the context of the joint Government/IBEC &mdash; TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) three year Agreement to fund local connectivity at school level. The broadband connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network supported by HEAnet, in order to provide managed Internet access, email, <Col N="446"/>security controls and content filtering. A broadband support service is being managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network. The overall costs of the Schools Broadband Access Programme, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the three years, are in the region of &euro;30m. To date, 3,901 schools have had their local connectivity installed and of these 3,899 have had their router capability installed and tested.  A further 72 schools have had broadband access provided under the Hermes and Advanced Deployment programmes and are not included in the 3,901 figure.</P>
        <P>Looking to the future, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has launched the Next Generation Broadband Policy Paper which includes the objective of equipping second-level schools with 100 Mbits per second of broadband connectivity and installing local area networks. I look forward to working with my colleague, Minister Ryan, in the pursuit of this objective. Furthermore, my Department will shortly issue a Request for Tenders for the next round of service under the existing Schools Broadband Programme and having regard to the general developments in broadband availability nationally, improved service offerings are expected to be received under the new tender process.</P>
        <P>While the ICT facilities in our schools have improved considerably, I am conscious of the need for further investment to ensure that we are realising the full potential of ICT to improve the learning experience of our students.  The Programme for Government sets out our commitment to implementing a comprehensive Schools&rsquo; ICT Strategy, which will be underpinned by the investment of &euro;252m as provided for in the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  The Deputy will be aware that my predecessor appointed a strategy group to advise on the priorities for expenditure on information and communications technology in schools, having regard to the provision in the National Development Plan for the investment of &euro;252m in the ICT in Schools Programme.  I intend to publish the group&rsquo;s report very shortly.</P>

        <Quest> the steps being taken to provide second level teachers and students of Gaeilge with guidelines on the way the leaving certificate Gaeilge oral exam will be examined from 2012 to accommodate the increase in marks to 40% as announced in 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>In March 2007 plans were announced to increase the proportion of marks available for oral assessment in the certificate examinations in Irish to 40%, for pupils beginning second level schooling in 2007/8. This will impact on the voluntary oral Irish examination available as an option within the Junior Certificate from 2010 onwards, and the national oral examinations in the Leaving Certificate from 2012. The measure is designed to promote a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools.</P>
        <P>A subject-specific support service for Irish has been established, as part of the Second Level Support Service (SLSS), to provide professional development for second-level teachers and support the use of Gaeilge as a communicative language in schools and classrooms. The work of the support team is assisted by a professional advisory group which includes representatives of my Department, the State Examinations Commission, An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, Foras na Gaeilge and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>
        <P>To date the service has concentrated on the induction of team members and the preparation of seminars for teachers of First Year Irish. 54 seminars have been planned nationally for Term One, with the intention that two teachers of First Year Irish from all second-level schools will have had access to these seminars by the end of the current school year. Targeted seminars to teachers of First Year Irish in Irish-medium and Gaeltacht schools are also being provided.</P>
        <P>The support service has also been undertaking an audit of the professional development needs of the teachers with whom it has been working and this will inform its work into the future. The service will shortly be looking at ways to make courses available to support teachers who wish to upskill themselves in the spoken language.</P>
        <P>I expect to receive advice shortly from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) on the revised assessment arrangements that will have to be put in place to support the change in the proportion of marks available for oral Irish in both the Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate examinations.</P>

	<P>My Department has no plans to introduce mandatory first aid training for Transition Year students in post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>Personal safety is addressed in a variety of ways in the primary and post-primary curricula. Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) which is compulsory for all students up to the end of junior cycle aims to develop students&rsquo; skills for keeping safe and to make students aware of appropriate responses to various threats to personal safety. This provides schools with opportunities to prioritise first aid if they consider this to meet the needs of their students.</P>
        <P>A programme in Social, Personal and Health Education for senior cycle is currently being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. In this context, a draft curriculum framework has been published for consultation.</P>
        <P>The Health Services Executive collaborates with my Department and the Department of Health and Children in supporting the delivery of SPHE in schools.</P>
        <P>In other subjects such as home economics, the sciences, the technologies and physical education students learn how to protect themselves from harm and how to treat minor injuries.</P>
        <P>Many schools already offer modules on first aid to Transition Year students. These may be delivered by organisations such as the Red Cross, the Order of Malta or St John&rsquo;s Ambulance or by teachers who are qualified in first aid.</P>

When the review of teacher education programmes in all relevant 3rd level institutions is complete, the nature and extent of specific training provision for student-teachers in this area will be much clearer.

	<P>The Value for Money Review of Clothing Procurement in the Defence Forces was published in September 2007.</P>
        <P>This review has identified potential for increased efficiency and effectiveness in the clothing storage and distribution system. An implementation group, tasked with drawing up a detailed implementation plan has been established.  The anticipated improvement in inventory turnover ratios should decrease the volume of clothing stock on hand. However, it is vitally important to ensure that the Defence Forces clothing needs continue to be met.  The optimisation of inventory levels and the clothing distribution system are inextricably linked to supplier performance and the implementation group are considering this factor in their deliberations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 781 and 782 together.</P>
        <P>When demolition of the steelworks at Haulbowline commenced in the summer of 2005, it was agreed by all interested parties that dust monitoring equipment be installed on the Naval Base. The monitoring equipment selected and installed in two locations on the Base was as follows:</P>
        <P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />Bergerhoff dust deposition gauges: These record on a monthly basis the total dust fall-out, which is expressed in terms of milligrams per square metre per day</P>
         <P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />PM-10 monitors: These record the respirable fraction of fine dust in real time, and have allowed dust generating events on the steelworks site to be identified and controlled as they happen. Results from these instruments are expressed in terms of micrograms per cubic metre of air sampled.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">All data collected over three years of demolition and site clearance has been independently reviewed by White Young Green who conclude that activities on the steelworks site has had &lsquo;no significant impact on the receiving environment in terms of fugitive dust emissions&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>While the monitoring equipment was not designed to detect individual metals or PCBs, the spent filters from the PM-10 monitors have been retained with a view to analysing for heavy metals, and this is being pursued.  However, it is understood that these filters will not be suitable for the analysis of chromium VI.</P>
        <P>My Department has, following the excavations on the East Tip, engaged environmental consultants, RPS Group plc, to review the situation and carry out sampling and to conduct soil and air analysis, across the Naval Base, which will check for heavy metals and other species. This investigation has already commenced and is expected to be completed in about six weeks.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces provide annual medical examinations and health screening for members of the Defence Forces including the Naval Service.  There is currently no indication that the situation at the former ISPAT site represents any risk to the health of Naval Service personnel or civilian employees at the Naval Base.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined as follows:</P>
        <P Just="Left">2002 &mdash; A Report on The Nature and Extent of any Harassment, Bullying and Discrimination and Sexual Harassment in The Defence Forces was commissioned (the &lsquo;Doyle Report&rsquo;).  The report was drawn up under the aegis of a Group chaired by Dr. Eileen Doyle.  The Group also included civil servants from the Department of Defence as well as members of the Defence Forces.  The cost of report was &euro;63,000.</P>
        <P>2004 &mdash; Report from an Independent Monitoring Group, which was set up to give effect to the recommendations of the Doyle Report concerning Harassment, Bullying and Discrimination and Sexual Harassment in The Defence Forces.  This Group was also chaired by Dr. Eileen Doyle and included civil servants from the Department of Defence as well as members of the Defence Forces.  The cost of report was &euro;161,259.</P>
        <P>The Independent Monitoring Group was re-constituted in February 2008 to review progress with the implementation of the recommendations of both Reports.  The group is working under the chairmanship of Dr. Doyle and includes representatives of military management, the Defence Forces Representative Associations and the Department.  It is expected that the report of the group will be completed before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>2005 &mdash; On 28 October 2005, I appointed Mr. Sean Hurley to carry out an independent review of the interaction between the Department of Defence/Defence Forces and parents and family of Private Kevin Barrett in the aftermath of his tragic death, on 18 February, 1999, while serving with the 84th Infantry Battalion in Lebanon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I received Mr Hurley&rsquo;s report on 2 February 2006, the cost of which was &euro;12,641.03.  The full report was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 6 February 2006. Following the publication of Mr Hurley&rsquo;s report, the recommendations and conclusions in relation to procedural and operational issues were considered by the Defence Forces to see how they might best be implemented.  The military authorities undertook a review of the guidelines for dealing with bereaved families in the light of Mr Hurley&rsquo;s recommendations.  I am advised that while there is no proposal to further amend the current arrangements, which were introduced in 2001 following a comprehensive review, the guidelines are being kept under continuous review.  In addition, standard operating procedures in relation to the investigation, reporting and handling <Col N="456"/>of such incidents were reviewed to take account of the various other recommendations in the report.</P>
        <P>2005/2006 &mdash; The Office of Emergency Planning commissioned a Public Attitude Survey, which was conducted by Millward Brown, IMS.  The cost of the survey was &euro;30,912. The purpose of the survey was to carry out a market research programme into public attitudes and awareness of emergency planning in Ireland.</P>
        <P>2006 &mdash; The Office of Emergency Planning requested Grayling Communications Consultants to devise a Communications Strategy on the approach to be taken by Government in its public information and awareness campaign on Emergency Planning.  The campaign was subsequently launched in April 2008.  The cost of developing the strategy was &euro;14,520.</P>
        <P>2007 &mdash; Following a tendering process TNS MRBI an independent market research company was awarded the contract to undertake research into the issue of Recruitment And Retention Of Women In The Defence Forces.  The research tested women&rsquo;s attitudes to military life and a career in the Defence Forces.  The cost incurred was &euro;47,746.60.  I launched the report on 5 April 2007.  The results of this market research will assist in the formulation of policy and practice in this area for the future.</P>
        <P>2008 &mdash; Following a tendering process PA Consultant Group was awarded the contract to make recommendations on the best means of meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces.  The contract was awarded in June 2008 and the estimated cost of this review is &euro;95,000 excluding VAT.  The consultancy will focus on the sustainable provision of the relevant medical expertise and services to the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The first phase, which is a review of the current and future requirements in relation to medical services, has already started.  It is expected the report will be delivered before the end of the year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 786 and 796 together.</P>
        <P>The project to which the questions refer was the subject of applications for assistance from the European Refugee Fund (ERF) and the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals (EIF).  Pobal is the delegated authority administering these Funds for the purpose of the Decisions establishing them.  In that capacity, Pobal sought applications for proposals for funding, through an open call for proposals, from the voluntary/NGO sector and partnership companies and evaluated and took decisions on the applications received.  Pobal <Col N="457"/>assessed the applications according to a number of published criteria which had been made available to applicants during the application process.  The project in question was unsuccessful in the applications to both Funds.</P>
        <P>The decision on the ERF application, but not the EIF application, was appealed by the promoters of the project.  The appeals process involves a new assessment by a reviewer in Pobal who was not involved in the original decision and did not have access to the original appraisal prior to completion of the review.  The applicant was unsuccessful in the review.</P>
        <P>It is likely there will be further calls for proposals in respect of these Funds in the coming months.  This will allow this applicant and other unsuccessful groups an opportunity to re-evaluate their proposals and submit new applications if they wish.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that Pobal has followed a fair and transparent process in the management of these Funds.  It would not be appropriate for me to seek to change their decision on individual applications and this would be inequitable both to the successful and unsuccessful applicants.</P>

	<P>The intention to establish a Ministerial Council on Integration was referred to in &ldquo;Migration Nation a statement on integration strategy and diversity management&rdquo; which I published on 1 May, 2008.</P>
        <P>The Council on Integration, which will advise me on issues faced by migrants will consist of up of 40 members.</P>
        <P>The members of the Council will be migrants. In appointing members, account will be taken as far as possible of the need to have a balance between countries of origin, number of migrants from particular countries, places of residence in Ireland and the need to have appropriate gender balance.  Members of the Council will be appointed for a period of five years.</P>
        <P>I am considering the membership of the Council and I would hope to launch it by September next.  I shall place the names of those appointed in the Library when the membership of the Council has been finalised.</P>

	<P>Arising from recommendations in the Report of the Government Alcohol Advisory Group, section 8 of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008, which is currently before the House, contains proposals for structural separation of alcohol products in mixed trading premises such as supermarkets and convenience stores.</P>
        <P>Following publication of the Bill, organisations representing supermarkets, convenience stores and other mixed trading outlets have offered to implement a sector-wide voluntary Code of Practice as an alternative to the section 8 provisions.  The Code would cover issues such as <Col N="458"/>the location and display of alcohol within premises, signage, warning signs, in-store advertising, as well as staff training standards.  Implementation would be overseen and enforced through an independent audit and verification mechanism.</P>
        <P>I received a first draft of the proposed Code from Retail Ireland last week and it is being examined in my Department and in the Department of Health and Children.  It will, or course, be necessary to have support for its contents from all the bodies representing mixed trading outlets across the country.</P>
        <P>I have already indicated to the House in the course of the Second Stage debate on the Bill that I am disposed to deferring implementation of section 8 of the Bill on being satisfied that agreement has been reached on the Code and there is the required level of support for its strict implementation across the mixed trading sector; that the Code would achieve in effect what we have set out to achieve through structural separation; and that the Code is subject to independent verification on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>I look forward to further debate on the question of the proposed Code during the Committee and remaining stages on the Bill.</P>

The Bill also provides that a minimum closure period of two days shall apply in future in cases where a temporary closure order is imposed by the courts.  The imposition of such an order is mandatory in cases where a licensee is convicted of the offence of selling intoxicating liquor to an underage person.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the Value for Money (VFM) review of Asylum and Immigration was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in November 2006.</P>
        <P>The Review was carried out during a period of significant change, a key feature of which was falling numbers of asylum applications in the State and very significant increases in numbers for other immigration services.  The outcome of the review was a comprehensive series of recommendations clustered around nine key areas.</P>
        <P>A unique feature of the review was that it was a dynamic constantly evolving process. As recommendations were agreed, the implementation cycle also began.  This meant that by the end of the Review, all of the recommendations had been accepted and implemented or were at early stages of implementation.  A key driver in the implementation of these recommendations was the establishment of the Irish Naturalisation &amp; Immigration Service (INIS) in early 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A framework for the ongoing implementation of the recommendations arising from the Review has been in place since early 2007 in the form of a major Change Management initiative.  This initiative included the establishment of a dedicated Change Management Unit in February 2007.  The work of the Unit involves the co-ordination of the INIS Change Management Programme under the direction of a Change Management Project Board.  The Change Management Project Board is chaired by the Director General of the INIS and includes the senior management of all agencies/divisions in INIS.</P>
        <P>While many of the recommendations in the report have already been implemented or are currently being progressed, many of the structural and procedural changes proposed are contained in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill which is currently at Committee Stage in this House.  It is within the framework of the Change Management Programme that these recommendations along with all of the other recommendations contained in the VFM report will continue to be progressed.  This will support the continued delivery of asylum and immigration services in an integrated fashion.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s query concerning the anticipated savings to the Exchequer, while it is not possible to put a figure on the value of savings to the Exchequer generated from implementation of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations, I can say that greater overall value for money has been achieved in the delivery of services across all asylum and immigration areas <Col N="461"/>in recent years, through improved use of resources and improved efficiencies in the processing of applications.</P>
        <P>For instance there are now much faster processing timescales for asylum determinations and the backlog which existed a number of years ago has been essentially eliminated.  Visa processing times have also been significantly speeded up. Savings have also been achieved through various operational and enforcement strategies and other initiatives undertaken in the asylum and immigration areas in recent years.</P>
        <P>Further improvements in service delivery and value for money will be achieved arising from the implementation of a suite of IT systems, including a new case management system for INIS.  The implementation of the new Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will also give rise to greater efficiency in how services are provided.  In the area of protection, the Bill provides for the introduction of a single procedure for the processing of an application for protection in the State whether as a refugee or as a person eligible for subsidiary protection.  The investigation of such an application shall also include whether, not being entitled to protection, an applicant should be otherwise permitted to remain in the State.  This will replace the current three stage process under which each of these matters is determined sequentially.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that a review of certain aspects of its capital expenditure programme was commissioned in June 2006 under the framework of the Expenditure Review Initiative of the Department of Finance.  The report of the independent review group was published in August 2007.</P>
        <P>The review concluded that the response made by the Irish authorities, in terms of capital investment, has at a general level been strategic in terms of its aims, appropriate in terms of the projects undertaken, and reasonably effectively delivered within the budgetary, operational and policy context and constraints in which it has occurred.</P>
        <P>The review group also made recommendations in relation to forward planning, capital programming and project appraisal and review.  The Prison Service has accepted all of the recommendations and a Capital Programme Monitoring Committee has been established to oversee the recommendations set out in the report.  These recommendations are largely of a procedural nature and it is not possible to quantify the potential savings to the Exchequer as they relate to future projects.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 31 January 2005 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 21 November 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted representations in support of his application for leave to remain in the State and also submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  The Subsidiary Protection application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted a separate application for residency in the State on the basis of being the spouse of an EU National who was seeking to exercise her EU Treaty Rights.  This application was refused because the person concerned had not been lawfully resident in another Member State prior to entering this State.</P>
        <P>The person concerned initiated Judicial Review Proceedings challenging this decision. The case was settled and, as part of the agreed Terms of Settlement, my Department agreed to re-consider the EU Treaty Rights application.  However, subsequent to this settlement, the Metock and Others case arose which was referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ Ref. No. C-127/08).  The Metock and Others case deals with the issue of whether or not a Member State of the EU can introduce a general requirement that restricts the scope of a directive.  This case was heard in early June and my Department is currently awaiting the outcome of this case. The case of the person concerned is similar in nature to the Metock and Others case.  In light of this situation, my Department is not currently in a position to make a decision on the re-consideration of the application for residence under EU Treaty Rights on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>Regarding the other outstanding applications of the person concerned the position is that in the event that the Subsidiary Protection application of the person concerned is refused, my Department will examine the position in the State of the person concerned based on the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.</P>

        <P>The CSO has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.</P>
        <P>I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to her.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling domestic and sexual violence is reflected in the establishment in June, 2007 of Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence. Cosc&rsquo;s key responsibility is to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Cosc&rsquo;s major priority is to produce a National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence which has the support of State and non-government organisations in the sector.  This Strategy will set out the policy on addressing domestic and sexual violence, and the preventative <Col N="464"/>and responsive actions to be taken by the broad ranging organisations to ensure a well co-ordinated system.  The preparation of the Strategy is being carried out in partnership with the relevant State and non-governmental organisations.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 11 August 2004 and applied for asylum on 29 September 2004. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal,  the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 28 October 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.</P>
        <P>The application submitted by the person concerned for leave to remain in the State is one of a sizeable number of such applications currently on hands. As the Deputy will appreciate, the consideration of such applications is resource intensive and the case will be processed as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I am advised by officials in the Long Term Residency Section of my Department that long term residency is an administrative scheme introduced in May 2004 and is focused on persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit / work authorisation / work visa conditions.  Such persons may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a <Col N="465"/>five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</P>
        <P>Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.</P>
        <P>While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</P>
        <P>An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in May 2008. I understand that applications received in October 2006 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I can inform the Deputy that I am satisfied that the existing arrangements in place meet the State&rsquo;s obligations in respect of the provision of legal aid for prisoners in criminal and civil matters.</P>
        <P>Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, and the Regulations made under it, free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons, including prisoners, of insufficient means in criminal proceedings. The Courts are responsible for the granting of legal aid. When granting legal aid, the court must also be satisfied that by reason of the &ldquo;gravity of the charge&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.</P>
        <P>I would also like to add that prisoners have recourse to legal representation under the Prisons Act, 2007, where they are appealing a decision by a Prison Governor to impose a penalty for a breach of prison discipline which involves the loss of remission.  Similarly, prisoners who have been referred to a designated centre under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act, 2006, by virtue of the fact that they may be suffering from mental illness, also have recourse to legal aid as part of the statutory process of having their detention in such an institution reviewed by the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board.</P>

	<P>The European Directive 2004/38/EC was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 226 of 2006) which took effect on 28 April 2006.  The Regulations were amended in December 2006 by the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations (S.I. 656 of 2006) in the light of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU on 1 January 2007.</P>
        <P>My Department exchanged written communication with the Commission in 2006 in regard to residence cards issued by other Member States under the Directive and in regard to visa processing for persons to whom the Directive applied.  My Department was due to discuss the Directive more generally with the Commission earlier this year.  However, the matter was overtaken by events and in particular by a referral to the European Court of Justice in the case of  Metock and Others (ECJ Ref No. C-127/08).  This case was heard by the Court on 3 June 2008 and a  ruling is awaited.  In the circumstances I am not in a position to comment further.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 17 January 2000 and applied for asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the then Asylum Division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 1 March 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted by the person concerned at that time.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of his case under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a deportation order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 28 October 2003.  This deportation order was not, however, served on the person concerned and it was revoked on 23 April 2007.</P>
        <P>Separately, the person concerned applied for permission to remain in the State on the basis of his parentage of an Irish born child, in accordance with the revised arrangements applicable to the non-national parents of Irish born children, born in the State before 1 January 2005, commonly known as the IBC/05 scheme. This application was refused, primarily because the person concerned did not meet the &lsquo;good character&rsquo; conditions attaching to the Scheme. The person concerned was notified that his application had been refused by letter dated 7 December 2005.</P>
        <P>The immigration status of the person concerned is currently being reviewed. Against this background, the person concerned was invited, by letter dated 19 April 2007, to submit updated representations in support of his application for leave to remain in the State. He was also invited to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations  2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) which came into force on 10 October 2006.</P>
        <P>The person concerned has submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>The Immigration Act 2003, which was commenced on the 15 September 2003, contained a number of key changes to the Refugee Act, 1996 which enabled the processing of asylum applications to be speeded up and enhanced our ability to deal with abusive applications. These changes included the imposition on applicants of a clear statutory duty to actively pursue their asylum applications and co-operate at all times with the processing agencies or face having their applications deemed withdrawn.</P>
        <P>The most common reasons for an application to be deemed withdrawn are where an applicant fails to attend for an interview at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) without reasonable cause; an applicant fails to co-operate with the Refugee Applications Commissioner after having lodged his or her application; or an applicant fails to notify the Commissioner of his or her postal address or change of address.</P>
        <P>Since the commencement of the Immigration Act, 2003 recommendations are made by the ORAC to the Minister that an application should be deemed withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Statistics are not maintained in a way which distinguishes between applications deemed withdrawn on the basis of applicants failing to notify the Refugee Applications Commissioner of their postal address or change of address and applications deemed withdrawn for other reasons.</P><Col N="471"/>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 307 of 20 February 2008 and also to Parliamentary Question No. 330 of 28 May 2008. The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</P>
        <P>The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.</P>
        <P>Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.</P>
        <P>While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</P>
        <P>An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in November 2007 and an acknowledgement has been issued to him.  I understand that <Col N="473"/>applications received in October 2006 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</P>

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal. Asylum seekers in direct provision avail of free full board accommodation with no utility or other costs associated with that accommodation. I understand that this family are currently seeking a transfer to Carroll Village centre Dundalk &mdash; one of a  limited number of self-catering units operated by the RIA.</P>
        <P>By way of background, the Deputy may wish to note that the couple referred to in the details supplied made applications for asylum at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) on 8 May 2005 and were initially accommodated at Kilmacud Reception Centre. After this initial reception period, the couple were dispersed to Globe House in Sligo on 16 September 2005 where their first child was born on 19 September 2005. In June 2006, following requests for alternative accommodation, the family was transferred to Athlone Accommodation Centre. The family&rsquo;s youngest child was born on 3 September, 2007.</P>
        <P>The management and head chef at Athlone Accommodation Centre have had numerous meetings with this family and have worked closely with them to ensure that their dietary requirements are met. The RIA has received formal written transfer requests from this family on 14 December 2007 and 5 May 2008 requesting alternative accommodation. As supporting medical information was included in the request, it was referred to an independent medical referee for review and recommendation. Having considered the medical documentation provided, the medical  referee stated that there was no medical evidence to warrant a change of accommodation. The family were informed  of this by letter on 14 May 2008. This letter was re-issued on 28 May 2008 as the family stated that they had never received the original letter.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 235 of Wednesday 7 November 2007, and the written Reply to that Question.  </P>
        <P>The family concerned, namely a husband, wife and son, arrived in the State on 19 August 2003 and applied for asylum. The then minor son was included as part of his mother&rsquo;s asylum application. The asylum applications were refused following the consideration of the cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The wife and son of the family concerned returned voluntarily to the family&rsquo;s country of origin on 27 April 2005, through an arrangement supported by my Department and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).</P>
        <P Just="Left">The son of the family concerned re-entered the State on 20 May 2005 and was reunited with his father who had remained in the State. As the son was still a minor, his father was deemed to be his guardian and, as such, the son&rsquo;s asylum claims, heretofore dealt with as part of his mother&rsquo;s application, was transferred to his father&rsquo;s application.</P>
        <P>The cases of the father and son were considered under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) following which, as an exceptional measure and subject to certain stated <Col N="475"/>conditions, both persons were granted leave to remain in the State. The persons concerned were notified of this decision by separate letters dated 26 July 2005 in the case of the father and dated 28 July 2005 in the case of the son. In each case the period of leave to remain in the State was one year i.e. to 31 July 2006. Both persons had their period of leave to remain in the State renewed for a further twelve months i.e. to 28 August 2007, a position made known to the persons concerned by separate letters dated 29 August 2006. Following receipt of an application for renewal of this leave to remain in the State, the father was notified by letter dated 4 December 2007 that his period of leave to remain in the State had been extended by a further three years, to 4 December 2010. The son&rsquo;s renewal application is under consideration at present and I expect a decision to issue shortly.</P>
        <P>According to my Department&rsquo;s records, the mother in the family concerned has no applications outstanding in my Department at the present time. Indeed her status in my Department&rsquo;s records is that of a person who has returned voluntarily to her country of origin. Given that there is no record of her having legally re-entered the State i.e. on the basis of a Visa or a Work Permit, the person concerned would have to be regarded as being illegally present in the State at this time should they have re-entered the State.</P>

	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a number of organisations in Ireland, registered with the Unit, which employ personnel to work in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or student capacity with children and/or vulnerable adults.  All Local Authorities are registered with the GCVU.</P>
        <P>In the vetting process checks are conducted on the Garda Criminal Records database in respect of all applications received.  The policy in place with all organisations registered for Garda Vetting is that the vetting subject gives written permission, on the Garda vetting application form, for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to disclose to the Authorised Signatory in the registered organisation details of all prosecutions, successful or not, pending or completed and/or convic<Col N="477"/>tions, recorded in the State or elsewhere in respect of them.  In all instances where the provisions of the Probation Act are applied as a consequence of a prosecution, the details recorded in respect of a vetting subject are disclosed to registered organisation.</P>
        <P>All court outcome records in respect of all proceedings commenced in relation to an individual vetting subject, as held by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the time a vetting application is received by the GCVU, are disclosed to the Authorised Signatory in the registered organisation which has submitted the application for vetting, in line with established policy.  All Garda vetting disclosures are issued directly to Authorised Signatories in registered organisations, who are trained liaison personnel within those organisations.</P>
        <P>I would remind the Deputy that Garda vetting is but one component part of the employment procedures in place in the registered organisations.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has no input into any decision made by any given organisation regarding the suitability, or otherwise, of an individual applicant for eventual employment.</P>

        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 1 April 2006 and applied for asylum.  Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that the person concerned had previously made an asylum application in France and, as such, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations, it was determined that his asylum claim should be examined by the French authorities. This determination was upheld following an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Consequently, a Transfer Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 1 August 2006, obliging him to present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on 22 August 2006, to make arrangements for his transfer to France. The person concerned &lsquo;presented&rsquo; as requested on this occasion and a flight was arranged for his formal transfer on 30 August 2006.  However the person concerned &lsquo;evaded&rsquo; his transfer and thus became illegally present in this State. The person concerned continued to evade his transfer to France with the consequence that the Transfer Order expired and Ireland became responsible for processing his asylum application. At this point, in early 2008, the person concerned was admitted into the asylum process in this State. The person concerned was invited to attend for interview at the Offices of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on 21 January 2008 but failed to attend as required. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(2) of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), the Refugee Applications Commissioner refused him a declaration of refugee status.</P><Col N="479"/>
        <P>Based on the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 11 June 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  To date the person concerned has not responded to my Department&rsquo;s letter dated 11 June 2008.</P>
        <P>The case file of the person concerned will now be considered under Section 3 (6) of Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. When this consideration has been completed, the file is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act, relating to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children&rsquo;s Court.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that up to 31 May, 2008 no behaviour warnings have been issued or good behaviour contracts agreed in the Garda Districts referred to by the Deputy in Wexford/Wicklow.  In the Limerick Garda District referred to six behaviour warnings have been issued to adults and six to children and two good behaviour contracts, which apply only to children, have been agreed.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that no civil or behaviour orders have been issued by the courts upon application by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>In setting up the regime, the intention was that these warnings or good behaviour contracts would themselves address the problem behaviour.  It is only if they fail that a court order will be applied for.  In any case, it inevitably takes time to reach the stage where a court order itself might be sought.  No significance therefore should be attached to the fact that the stage has not yet been reached in the process where a court order has been issued.  Where warnings or good behaviour contracts do not succeed in altering a person&rsquo;s behaviour, however, they will culminate in a court order being sought by the Garda authorities from the courts.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s 2008 Policing Plan, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, contains the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals to realign Garda boundaries in a number of areas around the country to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  This includes the establishment of a new Kildare Division with Naas as the Divisional Headquarters. The planned changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.  Four new Divisions of Wicklow, Wexford, Louth and Meath have been created to date.</P>
        <P>Project boards have been established in each Garda division, including one in Kildare, to develop implementation plans to establish and rollout the new divisional changes.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that for logistical reasons, all of the remaining Divisional changes specified in the 2008 Policing Plan are expected to take place simultaneously with a starting date of 1st January next.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 853 and 870 together.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to decide on the prioritisation and allocation of resources within the force. The Commissioner has informed me that, as of 31 May 2008, the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Juvenile Liaison Service was 101. The Garda Commissioner has given a commitment to appoint an additional 21 personnel by 2010. Of course, while these officers are specifically dedicated to this service, a significant number of Garda&iacute; are engaged in liaising with juveniles on a day-to-day basis. In the time available to answer the question it was not possible to establish the number of Garda&iacute; involved with the Juvenile Liaison Service in each division. I will write to the Deputy when this information becomes available.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner has also pointed out that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>
        <P>The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. It also enables referral to the Garda Youth Diversion Projects which operate separately from the Diversion Programme. These Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour.   There are currently 100 of these projects operating throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that prison spaces have actually increased in the past six years. On 4 July 2002 there was a prison bed capacity of 3,474. This has now been increased to a bed capacity of 3,611. The decision to close locations such as the Curragh, Fort Mitchel and Shangannagh, which had a total capacity of 264 places, was made for operational and financial reasons.  Any potential loss in capacity has been more than offset by the bringing into operation of previously unused prison spaces and improvements to the prison estate.  In particular, the opening of a new wing in Limerick Prison fully offset the loss of Fort Mitchel and the lost capacity in the case of the Curragh Place of Detention was greatly offset by the bringing into operation of previously unused spaces in the Midlands Prison.</P>
        <P>The ambitious prison capital programme now underway, with the full support of the Government, will result in the replacement and/or refurbishment of nearly 40% of the entire prison estate and the ending of &lsquo;slopping out&rsquo;.  The proposed new prison complex at Thornton Hall which will replace the outdated Mountjoy complex will provide accommodation for 1,400 prisoners in a range of security settings with all the support facilities to enhance regime activities for prisoners and provide modern facilities as are fitting a modern prison environment.  Other major works include the building of a new prison at Kilworth to serve the Munster region and the provision of additional accommodation at Shelton Abbey, Loughan House, Limerick, Wheatfield, Portlaoise and Castlerea.</P>

</table>
        <P FLI="0">Where possible, it is the aim of the Prison Service to provide single cell occupancy for all sentenced prisoners.  Exceptions are made for some prisoners who actually seek to double-up.  Prisoners may ask to share a cell with a friend or relative in custody and such requests are facilitated where possible.  Doubling up may also occur from time to time to meet concerns about the physical/mental health of a prisoner.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that the new prison buildings at Castlerea, Portlaoise and Wheatfield Prisons, as well as Thornton Hall and Kilworth will allow for increased single cell usage. The construction of new facilities will address the issue of cell occupancy levels and will, in addition, offer significant improvements in the areas of work training, education, medical services and in-cell sanitation.</P>
        <P>It must be noted, however, that accommodating prisoners is not simply a matter of matching the global prisoner population to a global figure for beds or cells.  A number of factors have to be taken into account including the prisoner&rsquo;s age, gender, the nature of the offence, location, security and whether they are on remand or sentenced.</P>

	<P>There are currently drug free units in the following prisons &mdash; Wheatfield Prison, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, Castlerea Prison and Mountjoy Prison.  There is also an intensive detox programme in operation in Mountjoy Prison.  Allied to this the Training Unit, Arbour Hill Prison, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey are regarded as drug free institutions.</P>
        <P>A wide range of security measures are currently in place aimed at reducing the supply of contraband, including drugs, into our prisons and in addition, new security initiatives are being introduced in all closed prisons. These include the introduction of enhanced security screening for all persons entering our prisons; the establishment of a drug detection dog service; and the establishment of Operational Support Units dedicated to, and developing expertise in, searching and gathering intelligence on illicit material being hidden inside our prisons.</P>
        <P>These measures are coupled with the provision of enhanced drug treatment services for prisoners and the introduction of mandatory drug testing.  The Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy and Strategy, &ldquo;Keeping Drugs out of Prisons&rdquo; provides for a comprehensive range of treatment options.  Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  The programmes seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  Particular initiatives include, inter alia, the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, addiction counselling and drug therapy programmes.</P>
        <P>The strategy sees existing drug treatment programmes being expanded and enhanced with the further recruitment of nurses, psychologists and 24 dedicated addiction counsellors, as well as other staff including prison officers.  The expansion of these services is being achieved in partnership with community based services and will see a significant improvement in the range, quality and availability of drug treatment service in the prisons.</P>

	<P>Since the publication of the Government&rsquo;s National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, Garda resources generally in the fight against illicit drugs have increased. This is particularly evident with the creation of additional Divisional Drug Units in areas of particular need.  These Drugs Units operate in Divisions throughout the country with a primary focus on local drugs activities.</P>
        <P>The Garda National Drugs Unit is the primary unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na charged with responsibility for drug supply law enforcement.  As at 3 July 2008, the personnel strength of the Unit was 63.  In addition, the total strength of the Divisional Drug Units is approximately 340.</P>
        <P>In addition the Organised Crime Unit, which was established on a permanent basis in January 2008, and now has a manpower of 70, has a specific remit of targeting those suspected of involvement in organised crime, including drug trafficking, importation, sale and supply.</P>
        <P>These units are also supported in their work by officers from other national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and <Col N="490"/>the Criminal Assets Bureau. In addition all Garda&iacute; are tasked with confronting drugs related issues as they arise.</P>
        <P>Internationally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with relevant law enforcement agencies including other EU agencies, the Drugs Enforcement Agency (US), Interpol and Europol and has liaison officers based in the Hague, London, Paris, Madrid Europol and Interpol.</P>
        <P>In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will actively participate at the Maritime Analysis Operations Centre for Narcotics, which was recently established in Lisbon, Portugal.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will also continue to provide ongoing training programmes for personnel as Divisional Asset Profilers, who have the specific remit of targeting assets of persons who are suspected of being involved in the importation, sale and supply of drugs at local, divisional/district, level.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that all of these available resources will continue to be deployed in targeting the major gangs involved in drug trafficking in accordance with the National Drugs Strategy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 859, 860 and 864 together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that full cooperation has been extended by the agencies of other jurisdictions from whom assistance has been sought in the investigation of suspected money-laundering offences.</P>
        <P>The nature of the international cooperation which is appropriate to such investigations includes the use of agencies such as Interpol, Europol and the Egmont Group of Financial Investigation Units. In addition, Memoranda of Understandings have been signed between the Financial Intelligence Unit (Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigations) and their FIU counterparts in twelve other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>Given the complex nature of this type of criminality, it is impossible to make a reliable estimate of its full extent.  One of the many difficulties encountered in such investigations is the extent to which legitimate business structures are used for the laundering of the proceeds of crime. All money laundering cases are fully investigated by the Money Laundering Investigation Unit at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation. The transnational nature of the offence of money laundering is also a feature of this type of crime which has been observed globally.</P><Col N="491"/>
        <P>In order to combat this, a range of measures have been implemented which assist law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions, including the implementation of the forty recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its nine special recommendations. The measures in question require jurisdictions to enact similar legislation in an effort to prevent use of the financial systems for money laundering and the financing of terrorism.</P>
        <P>The legislation in place in the Irish jurisdiction in terms of the investigation and prosecution of offences of money laundering represents best practice internationally as has been reflected in the reports of the FATF. This will be further enhanced following enactment of legislation, currently being drafted, giving effect to the third EU Money-Laundering Directive.</P>
        <P>The current legislative measures to prevent money laundering are set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 as amended by the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 and the Terrorist Financing Act 1995. Extensive use is also made of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) legislation as a means of gathering evidence in other jurisdictions for use in investigations in the Irish jurisdiction and visa versa.</P>
        <P>Comprehensive guidelines have also been issued by the Financial Regulator to Financial Institutions and other designated bodies.</P>
        <P>The effectiveness of these measures may be gauged by the number of suspicious transaction reports received annually by the Financial Intelligence Unit, with approximately 12,000 reports received which are referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners for appropriate investigation.</P>

	<P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carries out on a continuous basis intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in illegal activity.  There is a particular focus on organised criminal gangs, and intelligence on the personnel of such groups is continually updated.  Those suspected of involvement in criminal activity are arrested, detained and questioned in accordance with the law in relation to specific criminal activity.</P>
        <P>An allocation of &euro;20 million has been ring-fenced from the Garda Budget for 2008 for activities under Operation Anvil. These are augmented by other operations and initiatives by units and sections of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, both locally and nationally.</P>
        <P>The funding available enables the continuation of successful anti-crime measures directed at the prevention and detection of serious crime such as gangland murders, racketeering and other organised criminal activities, including through making available extra overtime.  It addition to overtime, it should be noted that as of May 2008 there were 13,874 fully attested members of <Col N="492"/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with 1,074 recruits in training. This gives a combined strength for the Force of 14,948, representing a net increase of 459 in the past eleven months, and makes available increased personnel hours.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner has been given significant additional resources to carry out these measures.</P>

	<P>One of the strategic actions to achieve the goals set out in the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s Policy Plan for 2008 is the continuation and intensification of intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in the trafficking of guns into and within the State.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all available intelligence is fully analysed and used in the strategic deployment of both local and specialised operational Garda units in targeting the procurement of weaponry by and for criminal gangs.</P>
        <P>Operations against organised criminal gangs operating in this jurisdiction are undertaken on an ongoing basis.  The members of such gangs and their operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are the subject of such operations, which are primarily undertaken by specialist units of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
        <P>Measures to deal with serious crime include Operation Anvil, which commenced in May, 2005 in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and was extended countrywide in 2006.  The primary focus of Operation Anvil is the disruption of serious and organised criminal activity.</P>
        <P>The most recent figures available show the significant impact which Operation Anvil is having.  In the Dublin Metropolitan Region there have been 906 firearms seized up to 1 June, 2008.   A further 734 firearms have been seized outside the Dublin Metropolitan Region up to 4 May.</P>
        <P>A wide range of provisions to combat gun crime was introduced by the Criminal Justice Act, 2006.  With effect from 1 November, 2006 mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, came into effect for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that it maintains close liaison with other law enforcement agencies throughout Europe, and elsewhere, exchanging information and intelligence on Irish <Col N="493"/>criminals living abroad. This ongoing liaison has led to a number of successful joint operations targeting the attempted importation of drugs and firearms and resulting in a number of significant arrests here and in other jurisdictions. Where intelligence, supported by evidence, is available, law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions put operations in place, as appropriate, in cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent and detect such criminality.</P>
        <P>Where information exists that a person who is wanted in relation to a particular crime in this jurisdiction is living abroad, and where particular legal requirements apply, extradition is sought, or an application is made for a European Arrest Warrant.</P>
        <P>Where there is justification and a legal basis, those suspected of involvement in criminal activity are arrested, detained and questioned in relation to specific crimes. A member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must, at all times, have reasonable grounds to believe that an individual has been involved in criminal activity before they can arrest and question any person in relation to criminality.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a party to various International Conventions which provide for assistance in criminal matters between jurisdictions.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na send and receive requests for assistance via the Central Authority for Mutual Assistance which is based in my own Department.  Requests for assistance may also be dealt with on the basis of reciprocity where certain jurisdictions may not be a party to specific conventions.</P>
        <P>The new Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 will provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with an additional ability to fight organised crime and obtain evidence outside Irish borders. This Act provides a greater role to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in servicing requests from outside this jurisdiction in terms of the monitoring of accounts in financial institutions in this jurisdiction and in obtaining evidence for use in other EU Member States in the fight against organised crime.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na participates in Europol, the EU law enforcement organisation that handles criminal intelligence.  The aim of Europol is to improve the effectiveness of, and cooperation between, the competent authorities of the Member States in preventing and combating serious international organised crime and terrorism.  In this respect, Europol facilitates the bilateral and multilateral exchange of information via secure and encrypted channels among the EU Member States, other European countries, and certain other nations such as the USA and Australia.</P>
        <P>Europol provides an extensive analytical capacity, providing operational and intelligence analysis on request.  Europol also generates and disseminates strategic reports such as threat assessments and early warning messages, which are distributed and actioned nationally as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Expertise and technical supports are also available on request.  Member States, including Ireland, second &lsquo;national experts&rsquo; to Europol from time to time for these purposes.  Europol channels are used by operational Garda units investigating trans-national organised crime affecting Ireland, and are similarly used by police and customs officials in other EU Member States who are investigating any serious criminal activity in their country.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also a member of the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) which is a worldwide organisation whose aim is to promote and facilitate enquiries into criminal activities.  One of its primary objectives is to ensure that criminals who operate at international level are arrested and successfully prosecuted.</P>
        <P>Interpol coordinates actions between police forces of member countries, of which there are 186. The five priority crime areas for Interpol are Fugitives, Public Safety &amp; Terrorism, Drugs and Organised Crime, Trafficking in Human Beings and Financial &amp; High-Tech Crime. Interpol <Col N="494"/>fosters close relationships with key international organisations.  The General Secretary of Interpol has achieved observer status at the United Nations and has developed a good working relationship with Europol.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has Liaison Officers based in the Hague, London, Paris, Madrid, Europol and Interpol to assist with international aspects of Garda investigations and assist other Law Enforcement Agencies in investigations involving Irish nationals.</P>
        <P>There are two categories of organised crime groups operating in this jurisdiction. The first category consists of individuals/groups that are well established and tightly structured involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences. The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.</P>
        <P>Organised criminal gangs operating in this jurisdiction are being targeted on an ongoing basis and profiles regarding the personnel of such groups are continually updated. Their members, operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are likewise proactively targeted and a Garda response embraces intelligence-led operations primarily undertaken by An Garda Siochana specialised units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drug Unit, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  In addition, information relating to these groupings is disseminated on a regular basis to Europol at The Hague in order to ensure that those operating outside of this jurisdiction can be pursued with the full rigour of the law.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the Property Registration Authority (PRA) is in the process of digitising the boundary information in respect of all registered titles.  The project commenced in July 2005 and is due for completion in 2010.  Counties Longford, Carlow, Meath, Westmeath, Kilkenny, Wexford, Clare, Louth, Wicklow, Roscommon and South County Dublin have now been completed and several additional counties will be digitised by the end of 2008.  Once digitisation has been completed in respect of a county, the digital map becomes the official record and is available for inspection in the PRA&rsquo;s public offices or over the internet to customers who are account holders who can view this information on-line.</P>
        <P>When the boundary data in respect of a county is digitised the paper maps for these counties are no longer the official record. They are however retained by the PRA as an archive and, <Col N="495"/>should the need arise, are still available for any clarification that may be required.

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Gardai assigned to Community Policing in the Tipperary Garda Division on 31 May 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 8.  The personnel strength of the Tipperary Garda Division on 31 May 2008 was 360.</P>
        <P>While this is the number of Garda&iacute; specifically assigned to community policing in the Tipperary Division, it is of course the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  I agree with the view of the Garda Inspectorate, expressed in its most recent report, that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland. The Deputy will also appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day personnel strengths of individual divisions, districts and stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking all relevant factors into account.  In that regard, the needs of the Garda Division referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</P>

	<P>The Valuation Act 2001 provides that community halls such as clubhouses which are not licensed to sell alcohol and whose facilities are not used primarily for profit or gain are not rateable.  The Act further provides that where a club is licensed to sell alcohol under the Registration of Clubs Act 1904 the premises occupied by that club is registered and rateable.</P>
        <P>The sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and club premises so licensed are competing with other commercial premises.  The effect of removing any category of rateable property from the valuation base would be to increase the rates base on other ratepayers.  Where a community hall or a sports club ceases to be licensed for the sale of alcohol it will no longer be rateable.  There are no plans at present to amend the valuation legislation as it applies to voluntary and community sports clubs.</P>

	<P>A number of reports and desk top studies have been undertaken down the years on behalf of Irish Steel, Irish Ispat, the Liquidator and the then Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  In 2005 White Young Green conducted the most comprehensive investigation undertaken at the site, which I have made available, including the full suite of technical data which it generated.</P>
        <P>The 2005 White Young Green report in particular summarises these earlier reports and desk studies and, more importantly, reports on comprehensive intrusive site investigations which included extensive analysis of soil, water and air, including sub-surface testing for heavy metals.  Their report indicated no immediate threat to human health or the environment in the locality, while of course recognising that this is a seriously contaminated site which will ultimately require an extensive and co-ordinated resolution.</P>
        <P>In light of the recent events my Department has now re-engaged the consultants to carry out an independent and rigorous assessment of current site conditions. This is now underway and will involve assessing the quality of surface water, marine sediment and mussel bivalves in vicinity of Haulbowline, a Health and Safety assessment of the East Tip and comprehensive ambient air monitoring. As already indicated, I will then report to the Government with a view to appropriate decision-making in regard to whatever actions are shown to be necessary.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 876, 881 and 916 together.</P>
        <P>The administration of the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability, which were introduced in November 2007 in place of the Essential Repairs and Disabled Person&rsquo;s Grant Schemes, is a matter for individual local authorities.</P>
        <P>My Department made combined capital allocations of &euro;491,790, &euro;5,516,160 and &euro;816,270 to Sligo, Cork, and Kilkenny County Councils, respectively, on 21 May 2008, for the operation of the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability.  The schemes are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  It is a matter for local authorities to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within this allocation.</P>
        <P>Requests for additional funding for the operation of the schemes are dealt with in the context of the reallocation of surplus resources from other local authorities and, as such, allocations provided to local authorities are generally revised during the course of the year where expenditure is higher or lower than anticipated.  Applications for additional funding from authorities will be considered by my Department in the light of any savings emerging later in the year in other local authority areas.</P>
        <P>Data regarding the monetary value of applications received by Kilkenny County Council in respect of the schemes is not held in my Department.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the lack of space for graves in a parish (details supplied) in County Wicklow; if, in view of the shortage of space in the local cemetery, he will require the Office of Public Works to facilitate the allocation of land for this purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Any proposal to extend the historic graveyard at St. Kevin&rsquo;s Parish, Glendalough would require my consent under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 2004. There is no application for such consent before my Department.</P>
        <P>While I understand that there can be very strong local attachment to historic graveyards, such as the one in St. Kevin&rsquo;s Parish, Glendalough, my Department must examine each application for consent to any extension on a case-by-case basis. Difficulties can arise with extensions to historic graveyards where there is (a) a national monument in the graveyard, (b) evidence of an early ecclesiastical enclosure around the graveyard or (c) the likelihood of archaeological deposits around the graveyard. These difficulties are particularly acute in the case of the graveyard in St. Kevin&rsquo;s Parish because of its proximity to the internationally important complex of monuments at Glendalough. There are also a number of protected natural habitats in the vicinity.</P>
        <P>In a case such as this I would encourage the relevant local authority and the local community to consider the option of opening a new graveyard at an alternative location away from the historic site. I am aware that this option has been successfully adopted in a number of areas.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware the State, acting through my Department in a co-ordinating role, took over custody of the site in question from the liquidator in June 2003 as mandated by Government.  The mandate required the Department to co-ordinate all legal actions in relation to the site, to cover matters such as site security, ongoing care and maintenance, and other issues arising, and to enable a site investigation to be carried out to assist in determining the best option, economically and environmentally, for the future use of the site and its remediation.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that since receiving this mandate in 2003 no material has been removed from slag heaps to be used in road construction, or indeed any other activity, despite a number of approaches to the Department from interested parties in this regard. Anecdotal evidence suggests inert slag material was employed for this purpose during the period when the steelworks was in commercial operation but my Department does not hold any records or information from this period.</P>

	<P>The State has no direct role in determining the number, type or capacity of incinerators which may be developed.  These are matters for the commercial sector or local authorities, who may act by way of public private partnership.  In either case any such projects must secure planning permission and a waste licence through statutory processes which are independent of the Minister and the Government.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government signalled the development of waste and resource policy in the direction of sustainability &mdash; in particular, to move away from mass burn incineration towards alternative technologies.  A major international review is examining, inter alia, the emergence of new technologies in waste management, particularly those for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste, which could reduce the need for incineration, and how they might be promoted.  The Government is committed to ensuring that we rapidly move towards a world class waste management system.</P>

	<P>My Department has consulted with the Office of Public Works (OPW), who are responsible for the management of Hore Abbey, a national monument in state ownership.  I am advised that there are no specific plans by OPW for the rebuilding or restoration of the Abbey ruins.</P>

        <P>My Department has set out policy guidance on the rebuilding or restoration of a ruin in its Architectural Heritage Protection Guidelines for Planning Authorities published in 2004. The guidelines point out, inter alia, that:</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />works related to the rebuilding or restoration of a ruin have the potential to alter materially the character of a structure;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />it will rarely be possible to bring back into use a building that has stood for a long time as a ruin without the replacement of certain amounts of original fabric;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The guidelines state that where a structure cannot be restored and brought back into use without comprising its special interest or character and in order to prevent further deterioration of the protected structure, it may be proposed to consolidate the fabric as it stands and to preserve the structure as a ruin.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 890 and 891 together.  </P>
        <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 406 of 4 June 2008.  Since then, the Minister for Finance has agreed that, in order to avoid delay in project delivery, there should be some flexibility in relation to the application of the new forms of fixed price contract and that, subject to certain <Col N="503"/>conditions, tenders for water services contracts received before 6 May 2008 using the old form of contract could be allowed to proceed.  Tenders for the collection network for the Kiltimagh scheme were received prior to 6 May 2008 and a contract may, accordingly, be placed when a construction stage budget has been approved my Department.  This will be determined shortly and notified to the Council.  I understand the Council is currently examining tenders for the wastewater treatment plant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Arrangements for the supply of subsidised home composting containers are an operational matter for individual local authorities.  While my Department&rsquo;s Waste Recycling Infrastructure Capital Grants Scheme provides assistance towards the provision of materials recovery and biological treatment facilities, including centralised composting facilities, direct subvention of householders by my Department is not envisaged at this stage.  However I understand that many local authorities already provide compost bins at subsidised prices.</P>
        <P>Full implementation of the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste will involve a range of measures, including home composting and the segregated collection of biodegradable waste, to treat residual waste.  To assist in ensuring that our waste management system can act in support of these objectives my Department has initiated the major review of waste management policy provided for in the Programme for Government, which will in part focus on the how best to advance the use of the full range of measures available for waste management.</P><Col N="504"/>
        <P>Furthermore my Department will shortly issue a circular letter to all local authorities seeking implementation, as rapidly as possible, of the measures for the management of biowaste within the various regional waste management plans, including the promotion by local authorities of home composting.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 895 and 921 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.  The Department&rsquo;s role is one of supporting and assisting local authorities in delivering fire services through setting of general policy and through the provision of funding under the fire service capital programme.</P>
        <P>In relation to a fire station at Graiguenamanagh, I recently conveyed approval in principle to Kilkenny County Council to construct a replacement station.  It is now a matter for the Council to advance the planning of the project.</P>
        <P>Provision was made by the Department, under the 2005 capital programme, to recoup the costs in respect of construction of a replacement station at Castlecomer.  In this context, the Department has informed the fire authority that the new forms of Construction Contracts for Public Works should be utilised in this project in accordance with relevant Department of Finance Circulars on construction procurement.</P>
        <P>As regards the construction of a replacement fire station at Urlingford, an application for funding has been made by the fire authority.  The funding application will be considered under future fire service capital programmes having regard to the fire authority&rsquo;s priorities and the competing demands from other authorities for the available funding under the programme.</P>

        <P>The flexibility in relation to the use of the old form of contract applies to certain tenders for water services contracts received by local authorities before 6 May 2008.  The date of submission of tender documents to the Department is not a relevant factor in that context.  As tenders have yet to be invited for Phase 2 of the Kildare Water Supply Scheme (Castlewarden to Ballygoran) the contract will have to be advanced in accordance with the new contract procedures.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 898 to 900, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 sets out the measures on foot of which Ireland will meet its target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol.  Compliance will be determined on the basis of average annual greenhouse gas emissions over the Protocol&rsquo;s five-year commitment period 2008-2012 rather than the performance of any particular policy or measure in a given year or generally.  Implementation of the Strategy is ongoing and I am satisfied that Ireland will meet its target.  A breakdown of the cost to date is not available.</P>
        <P>Evaluation of the actual greenhouse gas emissions for each year is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency.  Earlier this year, the Agency published the figures for 2006 which <Col N="506"/>showed that total national emissions were down 1% on 2005.  The report, which includes a breakdown by sector, is available from the Agency.  Reports on 2007 and 2008 will be made available by the Agency in due course.</P>

	<P>Under the Waste Management Acts the statutory responsibility for national hazardous waste management planning rests with the EPA which has prepared a National Hazardous Waste Management Plan. Section 60(3) of the Act precludes the Minister from exercising power or control over a matter for which the Agency has statutory responsibility. The Department therefore does not compile or maintain a list of sites which may contain such hazardous waste.</P>

	<P>My Department has funded a pilot programme, proposed by the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee, to test a range of new, small-scale wastewater collection and treatment systems under Irish conditions.  The objective of the pilot programme is to evaluate new approaches to meeting the wastewater collection and treatment needs of rural communities and to examine the potential role for group sewerage schemes in extending collection systems to households outside the catchment of new or existing public sewerage networks. </P>
        <P>The new infrastructure has now been commissioned and its performance is being monitored and evaluated.  The National Rural Water Monitoring Committee has been asked to report to me on the results as they become available and I intend to review the grants for group sewerage schemes in light of the outcome.

        <Quest> the situation regarding the operation of the scheme for collection of farm plastics; the costs involved in this scheme; his views on the fact that farmers are being asked to pay at the point of collection for this service when they have previously paid a levy when they are purchasing their plastics; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>A successful Producer Responsibility Initiative has been in operation since mid 1997 in relation to farm film/silage bale wrap.  Producers &mdash; i.e. manufacturers and importers of farm film/bale wrap &mdash; pay a levy of &euro;127 per tonne of farm plastic placed on the market to a compliance scheme, the Irish Farm Films Producers Group (IFFPG), who in turn are required to meet targets for the recovery and recycling of farm plastics.  IFFPG estimate that over 80,000 tonnes of farm plastics were collected for recycling since its inception in mid 1997.</P>
        <P>In the period up to 2005, demand for the service provided by IFFPG grew to exceed the capacity of the scheme.  Consideration was given by my Department in early 2006, in consultation with various stakeholders including farming organisations, to various mechanisms to address the need to ensure that sufficient resources were available to the scheme to meet future demand for collections while at the same time dealing fairly with accumulations of farm plastics on farms across the country.</P>
        <P>Following these consultations, my predecessor announced in May 2006 that IFFPG could derive an additional income from weight-based collection charges.  This was aimed at improving <Col N="510"/>the operational efficiency of the scheme by incentivising the presentation of clean, dry plastic by farmers.  The effect of the introduction of a charge has been to ensure that supply of collections of farm plastics to farmers can match demand on an ongoing basis and to improve the quality of the material being collected.  In addition, IFFPG have also introduced a labelling system to improve traceability of levied plastic which in turn will support compliance with the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001.</P>
        <P>In order to address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic on farms in 2005, designated facilities were provided on a temporary basis by local authorities where farmers could deposit stockpiled farm plastic free of charge.   These once-off free collections allowed farmers the opportunity to deposit any accumulated plastic purchased under the terms of the original scheme, which was based upon free farm-to-farm collections.  In total, some 35,000 tonnes of materials were collected at these temporary facilities over the period 2006 to 2007.</P>
        <P>The operation of temporary bring facilities has proved popular with farmers and earlier this year, in consultation with the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association, the IFFPG developed a calendar of some 130 collections nationwide where farmers could deposit bale wrap and silage wrap.   These collections have now commenced, will run through to the autumn and are based on weight-based charges.</P>
        <P>Farmers who produce the aforesaid labels indicating that levied plastic is being presented for recycling will avail of a substantially reduced collection fee by virtue of the fact that the producer levy is being used to subsidise all legitimately declared farm plastic.  Farmyard collections are still available from IFFPG but as they are more expensive to operate, they involve a higher charge.  Information on the dates, locations and fees for collections are available on IFFPG&rsquo;s website,<i> www.farmplastics.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>Management of public drinking water supplies is in the first instance the responsibility of the relevant local authority, which has a range of instruments and measures available to produce and conserve sufficient supplies to meet anticipated needs and to ensure quality standards. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving water services infrastructure to meet the highest international standards is reflected in the very substantially increased funding of some &euro;4.7 billion provided for water services in the National Development Plan 2007 - 2013, an increase of 27% on the previous NDP.   Details of currently approved water supply projects are set out in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with the publication of its report &ldquo;The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland: A Report of the Years 2006-2007&rdquo;, the EPA has listed 339 public water supplies where detailed profiling is required from source to tap to ensure consumers have a reliable supply that is consistently of a satisfactory standard.  My Department and the EPA are working in conjunction with local authorities to identify, agree and implement appropriate solutions in these cases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have also provided contingency funding of &euro;10m in 2008 for smaller scale upgrading works to schemes included in the EPA list and my Department is currently finalising its examination of local authority applications for funding from this provision.  Any major upgrading schemes required have been approved for funding under my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme and the Department is also considering proposals from local authorities for advance works that would expedite compliance with security and safety of supply requirements for these schemes.  The EPA will oversee implementation of all remedial measures as part of its enhanced supervisory role under the Drinking Water (No. 2) Regulations, 2007, which have strengthened the enforcement provisions in relation to drinking water standards.</P>

	<P>Actions against illegal waste activity are a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE). I am satisfied that appropriate powers are available to these enforcement authorities. </P>
        <P>The 2005 report of the OEE, The Nature and Extent of Unauthorised Waste Activity in Ireland, identifies the unauthorised collection and fly-tipping of waste as one of the problem areas in regard to waste management which need to be further tackled. The report draws attention to the measures already being taken, including the appointment of some one hundred <Col N="512"/>and twenty additional enforcement officers across local authorities, funded by my Department, and the stepped up enforcement activity generally being led by the Office and the local authorities. The report also identifies additional actions which would further support the effort to stamp out this socially and environmentally unacceptable practice. The implementation of these actions is being coordinated by the OEE through its National Enforcement Network.  My Department does not collate statistics on the cost of dealing with fly-tipping.</P>
        <P>The commitment in the Programme for Government to establish community-based &lsquo;litter watch&rsquo; systems was given in the context of protecting Ireland&rsquo;s scenic amenities and combating fly-tipping.  The Protecting Uplands and Rural Environments (PURE) Project is a pilot project launched on 1 September 2006 to combat the escalating problem of fly-tipping and small scale illegal dumping in the scenic area encompassed by the Wicklow and Dublin Uplands.  This project will be fully reviewed at the end of its three-year funding period and the results of this review will assist in assessing future policy options.</P>

The site notice must state, inter alia, that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority, and that submissions or observations in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing on payment of the prescribed fee within the 5 week period beginning on the date of the receipt by the planning authority of the application. A newspaper notice of the proposed development must be published in an approved local or national newspaper and again must set out details in relation to the inspection of the planning application and the making of submissions and observations.</P>
        <P>Ordinarily an appeal on a decision of a planning authority can be made only by the applicant, or an individual or group who made submissions or observations in writing to the planning authority in relation to the planning application in accordance with permission regulations. However, an exception is provided for persons with an interest in land adjoining a site which is the subject of the application. Section 37(6)(a) of the 2000 Act provides that a landowner/occupier on a site adjoining the application site may apply to the Board for leave to appeal the decision of the planning authority, within four weeks of the decision, even without having made submissions or observations to the planning authority in the first instance.</P>
        <P>It is also possible for an individual to apply to the High Court for leave to seek a judicial review of a planning decision.  Leave must usually be sought within eight weeks of the decision, and the High Court may only grant leave where it is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision is invalid or should be quashed.  The person seeking leave must also have a substantial interest in the decision and have participated in the decision making process or had good and sufficient reasons for not doing so.</P>
        <P>While I have no proposals before me at the moment, I will keep the position under review to ensure that planning notice requirements are both effective and cost efficient.</P>

	<P>Grant aid in respect of 161 playgrounds has been awarded to local authorities by my Depart<Col N="515"/>ment under the 2004, 2005 and 2006 playground schemes. Progress with the completion of these projects is a matter for the individual local authorities and time scales have varied considerably due to a range of planning and procurement issues locally. At the end of 2007 there were still some 80 playground projects outstanding and I understand that local authorities are continuing to make progress towards their completion.  The question of a new playground scheme will be reviewed in light of progress and experience of such schemes to date.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 932 and 934 to 939, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Considerable progress has been made to date on implementation of the reforms set out in the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, since its publication in February 2007.  Relevant sections of my Department&rsquo;s 2007 Annual Report and Annual Output Statement, which are available in the Oireachtas Library, provide compre<Col N="519"/>hensive material in relation to the progress made by my Department on housing matters last year.</P>
        <P>I expect to be in a position to submit the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to Government shortly, with a view to securing approval to its publication.  The Bill will give effect to a range of social housing reforms outlined in Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, including new provisions on the assessment of social housing needs, updated management and control powers, provisions in relation to anti-social behaviour, and the introduction of a statutory basis for Housing Action Plans.  The proposed Incremental Purchase Scheme is also being progressed in the context of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Sustainable Communities Fund envisaged under Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities was introduced in late 2007.  Funding of some &euro;7.6 million over a three-year period has been allocated across some 23 housing authorities to support a variety of projects including regeneration initiatives, tenancy liaison services and measures to reduce anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>In relation to the audit of the housing stock, the National Building Agency has undertaken a scoping study in preparation for a National Estate Condition Survey.  The results of this study will inform the next steps to be taken by my Department.</P>
        <P>The review of private rented accommodation standards is progressing well and I expect to be in a position to submit proposals to Government in September, with revised regulations to be made shortly thereafter.  Issues requiring primary legislative support will be progressed in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</P>
        <P>The National Property Services Regulatory Authority falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who I understand is currently arranging for the drafting of legislation to underpin the Authority.</P>

	<P>Since the announcement of 19 May 2008 by Dublin City Council that a number of regeneration projects being carried out through PPP arrangements would not now be proceeding as planned, my Department and the Council have met several times to assess the implications of the announcement for the projects concerned.  The City Council has also been engaged in discussions with the developer to identify the next steps in progressing these projects.  Revised proposals have been received for some of the projects and are being examined by the local authority.   No contracts had been signed for the projects at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate and Dominick Street, and the City Council is considering its next steps.  On all of the projects the City Council is working closely with the relevant regeneration boards, and has indicated its commitment to the remaining tenants in these areas.</P><Col N="522"/>
        <P>In advance of a clear outcome to the ongoing discussions with the developer, and the completion of a review by the City Council of the options available for advancing the projects concerned, it would be premature for my Department to take any direct action in relation to these projects.  My Department is, however, remaining in close contact with the Council as it considers the issues arising.  My Department is also examining the potential implications of these events for the PPP housing programme generally and a working group has been established in that regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 954 and 959 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  ComReg is responsible for the compiling of statistics from market data provided by service providers.  I understand that these statistics are collected on a national basis only.  I therefore, have no information in relation to the areas specified by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I have no function in the matter of the enabling for broadband purposes of exchanges owned by private companies or the quality of lines for provision of broadband services.  It is anticipated that the facilitation of greater competition via the introduction of broadband from different technology platforms should encourage the more rapid enabling of exchanges for broadband.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.

        <P>The remaining 10 -15% of the population live in unserved areas, i.e. areas where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.   The Government will address the lack of availability through the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The first phase of the NBS procurement process (the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete.  The remaining candidates have been engaged in &ldquo;Competitive Dialogue&rdquo; with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department&rsquo;s requirements.</P>
        <P>Judicial Review proceedings regarding certain elements of the NBS mapping process took place on 10 and 11 June 2008 in the High Court and a judgement is awaited.

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Low Income Housing Programme administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) was established to address one of the root causes of fuel poverty, which is the legacy of older housing with poor energy efficiency standards.  The Programme&rsquo;s primary focus is its Warmer Homes Scheme which provides attic insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets, energy efficient lighting, cavity wall insulation and energy advice at little or no cost to eligible households.</P>
        <P>The Warmer Homes Scheme is open to low income households. Local Authority houses are addressed separately. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment Heritage and Local Government provides separate funding through the Central Heating Scheme to local authorities to upgrade the heating and energy performance standards of public housing. &euro;26 million has been provided for the scheme this year which it is estimated will benefit up to 5,000 Local Authority Households. I have also doubled the budget for the Low Income Housing Programme to &euro;5 million in 2008 and this will enable SEI to fund insulation upgrades for 5,000 vulnerable households this year.</P>
        <P>I launched the pilot Home Energy Saving Scheme in April last which is designed to incentivise improvements in energy efficiency with particular focus on older housing stock. Further decisions about timing and funding of roll-out of a national scheme will be informed by the results of the pilot scheme and having regard to overall budgetary considerations.</P>
        <P>The Housing Aid for Older People Scheme was introduced by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government last year and provides targeted support of up to one hundred percent of cost to improve a range of conditions in the existing housing of older people. These include structural repairs or improvements, re-wiring, the provision of water, sanitary services, heating, repairs to or replacement of windows, provision of central heating and associated insulation works.</P>

	<P>The rollout of a national smart meter programme is progressing in line with the commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Framework and in the Programme for Government.  The Smart Meter programme is a central component of our strategy to significantly enhance management of demand for electricity and to achieve greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.</P>
        <P>The delivery of smart metering requires a collective response.  This is a technically complex and ambitious initiative. The Steering Group overseeing programme implementation is chaired by the Commission for Energy Regulation and includes representation from Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), ESB Networks, ESB Customer Supply and independent suppliers as well as my Department.  There are also four working groups, reporting directly to the Steering Group, which are mandated to progress the complex technical aspects of smart metering including Tariffs, Billing/Data Services, Networks and Customer Behaviour.</P><Col N="527"/>
        <P>ESB Networks is currently engaged in the final stages of a tender process to select smart meters for testing in the pilot phase, which is due to begin at the end of the year.  In parallel, work is well advanced on the design of the customer behaviour and tariff aspects of the pilot phase, led by SEI and ESB Customer Supply respectively.  In addition, good progress has also been made on the preparation of an interim data solution to be used during the pilot to deal with the much expanded quantity of data which will be generated by the interval reading functionality of smart metering.</P>
        <P>The combined results of these work streams will define the number of installations necessary to achieve the objectives of the pilot phase.  The overall objective remains to complete the national smart meter programme in five years, thereby providing an advanced cost effective electricity metering system which will deliver tangible benefits to all consumers of electricity.</P>

	<P>My Department undertook a Value for Money and Policy Review of the Sustainable Energy Priority of the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The review was published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in July 2006.</P>
        <P>The Review was set in the context of the difficulties faced by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) at that time in achieving full expenditure of their annual capital allocations under the Operational Programme. As a consequence of this, the Mid Term Review of the Operational Programme recommended significant reductions and reallocations in the amounts provided to the Priority measure. The Value for Money and Policy Review found that many of the programmes being run by SEI were in fact maturing as the recently established organisation worked to build capacity and systems. It was recommended that these be given time to develop and <Col N="528"/>become fully operational before any further funding decisions were made. The Review also found that SEI&rsquo;s programmes were in line with international best practice in the field.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 966 and 967 together.</P>
        <P>Matters relating to quality and levels of postal service are a matter, in the first instance, for the management and board of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function.  In addition, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the 2002 European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations, is responsible for the monitoring, measurement and regulation of the postal sector including measuring the levels of service to be achieved by An Post and ensuring that the company abides by its statutory universal service obligations.  Data regarding delivery targets can be obtained directly from An Post or ComReg.</P>
        <P>With regard to the commitment given in the Programme for Government to empower ComReg to enforce its delivery targets, I have amended the postal regulations using powers conferred on me by the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007.  These amended regulations permit ComReg to apply to the High Court for the application of a financial penalty to An Post, as universal service provider, in the event that the company fails to comply with a direction issued by the regulator, including one in relation to quality of service targets.</P>
        <P>With regard to the introduction of a postcode system, in May 2007 the National Postcode Project Board (NPPB) made recommendations to Government to introduce an alpha-numeric postal sector postcode model.  The work of the NPPB focused on quantifying the costs and benefits of postcodes to the postal sector including postal operators and customers.</P>
        <P>Government decided last year that prior to the introduction of postcodes, further analysis to quantify the wider economic implications should be carried out.  This analysis will be completed shortly.  On receipt of it, I will assess how best to take the proposal forward.</P>

	<P>The Greener Homes Scheme provides support to homeowners to invest in a range of domestic renewable energy heating technologies including solar panels, biomass boilers and stoves, and heat pumps.  The scheme is kept under regular review and earlier this week I announced Phase III of the scheme, which introduces a new eligibility criterion that only second hand houses, at least one year old, will in future be eligible for support.  This reflects with the recent coming into force of the new Building Regulations 2008, which for the first time see a compulsory requirement for a component of renewable energy in all new homes.</P>
        <P>The installation of renewable heating systems in existing houses is typically more complex and therefore more expensive than installation in new builds.  It is appropriate therefore to continue to provide incentivisation for owners of existing houses at this point in the developing market for renewable energy technologies.  There will be a small reduction in the levels of scheme support for existing biomass technologies, which are maturing in market terms.  I also announced that gasification boilers are being added to the scheme as a new biomass technology eligible for support.</P>
