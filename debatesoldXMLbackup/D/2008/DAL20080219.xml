      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
<P>I reported to the House on 10 October on actions taken arising from the final report by the Commission of Investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings 1974 and, as promised, a debate on the report was held in the House.</P>
        <P>I last had a formal meeting with the full Justice for the Forgotten group on 25 November 2004.  I met representatives of the group a number of times since then at other meetings involv<Col N="496"/>ing victims.  I met members of the group again on Monday, 10 December, when I unveiled a memorial to the victims of the Miami Showband massacre.</P>
        <P>My officials are in regular ongoing contact with the group and last met formally with their representatives on 30 October.  I have not received any recent request for a meeting.</P>
        <P>I met with the family of Seamus Ludlow on Tuesday, 22 January.  At that meeting I welcomed and acknowledged the work on this case of Mr. Justice Barron and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  I added my voice to the apologies already offered to the family by the Garda Commissioner and the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of the Garda investigation.  The family is being kept informed of the current active Garda investigation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the report of Mr. Justice Barron on the murder of Seamus Ludlow is an indictment in particular of senior Garda management who prevented a full investigation being pursued in 1979 even though they were aware of the identity of the four people directly involved in the murder of Seamus Ludlow and that two of those were serving members of the British army&rsquo;s Ulster Defence Regiment?  The report concludes that the decision not to pursue the investigation was taken by Deputy Commissioner Laurence Wren.  Would the Taoiseach believe, as this Deputy believes, that this was not taken wholly and solely by then Deputy Commissioner Wren, but in consultation with senior officials in the Department of Justice?  In the light of this damning conclusion does the Taoiseach agree that this case in particular highlights the huge responsibility of the State not only to come clean regarding what has happened but also to make amends for what was done and what failed to be done in the name of this State?  Will the Government agree to the request conveyed to the Taoiseach at his recent meeting with representatives of the Ludlow family for a full independent public inquiry?  When will the decision be taken to agree to concede to their request that has been repeatedly made?</P>
        <P>Have all the Barron reports and those of the Oireachtas sub-committee been presented to the British prime Minister, Gordon Brown, or his predecessor?  If they were presented in the first instance to the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has the Taoiseach considered presenting the current occupant of 10 Downing Street with the full complement of these reports including the Oireachtas sub-committee&rsquo;s reports following the reports of Mr. Justice Barron, Mr. Justice Hamilton and Mr. Patrick MacEntee?  Have parliamentarians at Westminster, altogether apart from the British Prime Minister, been lobbied for support for the repeated call of this House for a full independent judicial inquiry into all the matters we have recently addressed in this House under the banner of collusion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Subject to checking I think that all of the reports of the late Mr. Justice Hamilton and Mr. Justice Barron have been provided.  I will check whether they have been given to the present incumbent, the Prime Minister, Mr. Brown.  If not, I will have a look at doing that.</P>
        <P>In the follow up on the third Barron report, which deals with the murder of Seamus Ludlow, there are a number of recommendations made in the report on the murder of Seamus.  Specific recommendations from the Ludlow report have already been acted upon.  They include that all mechanisms be fully utilised by the Garda to liaise with the PSNI in respect of the investigation into the murder of Seamus Ludlow; and that the Garda Commissioner appoint a dedicated team of garda&iacute; to re-examine the case in a proactive manner to see if there is any possibility of bringing any or all of the four suspects to justice.  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that, as recommended by the Oireachtas joint committee, which was the key recom<Col N="497"/>mendation, the reinvestigation of the murder of Seamus Ludlow would commence.  That is now at an advanced stage and remains ongoing under the direction of a Garda superintendent.  Liaison has been established and maintained with the historical inquiries team in Northern Ireland and the family of the deceased have been kept fully informed of the status of the investigation.</P>
        <P>At a recent meeting with the family on 22 January, family members made it clear that in their view only a public inquiry would establish the truth about what happened.  Their legal representatives suggested they could frame a process that was narrowly focused with tight procedural deadlines and asked for an opportunity to discuss the inquiry process with officials from the Office of the Attorney General.  These discussions are taking place &mdash; some have already taken place.  I understand from the Attorney General and his officials that, following the first round of those discussions, they are not convinced that one can get a tightly-focused process, as opposed to a prolonged inquiry.  They are examining the matter, however.</P>
        <P>On the general issue, I have always said that the victims must be central to all that we are dealing with concerning the terrible events of the past.  I frequently meet officials who are in ongoing contact with the various groups representing victims of atrocities on all sides.  We have provided financial support for a number of those groups.  In addition, the Government and the British authorities have set up a number of inquires to deal with specific cases.  The British Government has established a well resourced historical inquiries team that will provide a thorough examination or re-examination of unsolved deaths during the Troubles.  The Police Ombudsman is reviewing cases involving the police, which can bring closure to victims and survivors and hopefully can build confidence within the community.  Of course, the Remembrance Commission is still in place and we have made available resources for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>While I acknowledge the Taoiseach&rsquo;s indication that, if it has not already been done, he will look at compiling all the reports I have cited, including those of the Oireachtas sub-committee, with a view to presenting them to Prime Minister Brown, will he indicate whether we have employed any other level of activity in lobbying parliamentarians at Westminster to give support to the request of the Oireachtas for full British co-operation in an investigation into all cases of collusion?  While the Taoiseach is on the record in this regard, will he acknowledge once again his personal concern at the fact that in 1974 we had a very short-lived investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 17 May of that year?  In addition, the Garda investigation into the murder of Seamus Ludlow was cut short at the direction of the then deputy Garda Commissioner, Laurence Wren.  Is it not within our own gift to have the full truth shone upon these particular actions?  Surely, it is within the gift of the Taoiseach and the Government to initiate a proper investigation and inquiry into why the garda&iacute; acted as they did and why, despite the fact that they knew the people who were responsible for the murder of Seamus Ludlow, they did not pursue the matter at the time but, indeed, perpetuated the absolute non-truth that the IRA was somehow involved, which of course time has demonstrated was not the case.</P>
        <P>On the justified criticism of the recent statements that took place here on the issue of collusion by myself and Deputy Costello of the Labour Party, the Taoiseach indicated in the course of same that he would be open to the idea of a D&aacute;il motion following the conclusion of that particular opportunity.  In light of that, will the Taoiseach convene an all-party meeting of representatives of all the parties here in order that a motion can be agreed?  I understand that a motion has been drafted and forwarded by Justice for the Forgotten.  Will the Taoiseach now call a meeting of either party leaders or whomever within this House so that that motion can be agreed by all parties and we can move this matter forward?  Does the Taoiseach not agree there is general acceptance that the statement of views that took place falls far short of the <Col N="498"/>statement of intent in terms of real action and an outworking of this issue?  Will the Taoiseach agree that such a motion should formally endorse the reports of the Oireachtas sub-committee, to be directed at the British Government and British Parliament, calling on them to release all relevant documents relating to collusion, especially concerning the killings that took place in this jurisdiction?  Will the Taoiseach also agree that it would serve a useful purpose if it included a call for the bringing about of a summit between himself and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, to address this issue as a stand-alone matter of major concern to the citizenry of this country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first question, I will follow up on the reports.  I have no problem giving a full set of the reports to the Prime Minister.</P>
        <P>We promised in the autumn to give time for a D&aacute;il debate on the issue of collusion.  We ran out of time before Christmas, at which point I said the debate would take place immediately after Christmas.  As soon as we came back to do that, however, it was stated that we needed a motion.  It was not what I had agreed to, but Justice for the Forgotten and some Members asked that I look at that.  Deputy Costello has written to me about it and I said I would look at it.  I was glad to provide time for the debate, as I had promised, and we did that.  We had a long debate, positions were set out and the message from this House was made clear.  If we can agree a comprehensive motion, that would be of assistance.  I have no difficulty with it.  If a motion can be agreed through the Whips, we can agree a time slot to debate it.  I never had a problem with that and we will do so if it is helpful.</P>
        <P>On the murder of Seamus Ludlow, I have been dealing with this issue for many years.  I have been in contact with the Ludlow family and their supporters for many years.  There is no doubt that how things happened at the time and what evolved from that led to a very unsatisfactory position.  There is no argument about that.  There were many arguments at the time, admittedly, and much publicity about what happened, but the fact is that all of that, as far as I am concerned, is now proved not to be so.  Seamus Ludlow left the rear of the Ballymascanlon House Hotel on that sad night and was picked up by people who, if they were not well known then, are certainly well known now.  There does not seem to be much dispute about who they were.</P>
        <P>Whether we will ever prove all of these things is another question.  The case remains the same and has remained the same for many years.  Was it followed up and investigated by the Garda and was it all dealt with in a way that, all these years later, I can stand over with total confidence and say that I am absolutely happy was correct?  No, I cannot do so.  I have said this for many years.  Can we get to the bottom of it now and get behind every circumstance of what happened?  It is very difficult to do so.  I am afraid it comes down to legal minds and whether they can formulate a way of dealing with it.  I have apologised, as have the Garda Commissioner and others, to the Ludlow family.  I met the entire Ludlow family and those who supported them through all these years at the recent meeting.  We will be as helpful as we can.</P>
        <P>Will we get any more information from the PSNI on this issue?  I do not know.  Can we get more information from the Garda?  I hope so.  As I said, the chief superintendent is examining this issue and going back over the files.  Deputy Commissioner Laurence Wren was criticised in the report, but he went before the committee to give his account and refute that.  It is disputed evidence.  An investigation is ongoing into the issue.  I must be honest before the House; on the advice I received after the first round, there does not seem to be a way of getting a tight investigation that can meaningfully deal with this issue.  As Deputies know, some of the four people who are alleged to have been involved in the murder are no longer about, which makes it difficult to get information.  I hope we can get a clear report from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <Col N="499"/> I am not sure if we can do so in the case of the Office of the Attorney General.  As I have said, I will try to help the family and its legal representative, who is dealing with the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>This case is in our own jurisdiction.  Several of the other cases are in Northern Ireland.  There are many such cases.  We do not need to go back through all the cases which were the subjects of the various Barron reports, all of which are finished.  We have the issues.  I have continued to lobby, and to have an active engagement in the British House of Commons and elsewhere, on the Finucane case.  I think I will meet Judge Cory again tomorrow.  We have continued to pursue that because it was part of the basis of the Weston Park agreement.  We have got on with the Smithwick inquiry into the Breen and Buchanan killings.  The same thing was supposed to happen in the Finucane case.  We have kept up our pressure.  I do not think we can get satisfactory results on all the other cases.  We cannot have inquiries into all of them.  We will not get behind the MI5 and MI6 information in many of the cases.  It is my assessment that no British Government, of any persuasion or with any Prime Minister, will go behind that.  I have had endless meetings, put endless pressure and done endless pressing in this regard.</P>
        <P>I believe the British Government has an obligation to Geraldine Finucane because it was part of a separate deal.  The historical inquiries commission and the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland can do a great deal of work in the other cases and we can continue our investigations.  However, I would put Geraldine Finucane&rsquo;s campaign on behalf of her late husband in a different category.  We remain in close contact with the Finucane family.  Senior officials met Geraldine Finucane on 21 February 2007.  I wrote to her personally at that time to assure her that the Government remains fully committed to supporting her and her family in seeking a full independent public judicial inquiry into her husband&rsquo;s murder.  We have pressed that at every level within the British system and will continue to do so.  At official meetings, there have been discussions on how best to progress the family&rsquo;s position.  We are continuing our efforts on that.  The Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Foreign Affairs and other bodies have been helpful.  We are putting all our efforts into helping the Finucane family by exerting the maximum pressure on the British Government and the British system.</P>
        <P>As of now, I do not get any sense from the British authorities that they are willing to meet the Finucane family&rsquo;s needs.  However, we will not give up on this one.  I know there is a view that there may be little point in holding an inquiry at all in the absence of agreement, particularly from the family, regarding such an inquiry.  In my view, it would be an enormous tragedy if the truth of this case did not come out.  Therefore, I hope we can still find a way to meet the family&rsquo;s needs.  Every bit of evidence, including hearsay evidence and everything else we have been through on this &mdash; a lot of it is substantive enough &mdash; suggests that there was collusion.  It is important that this issue is examined, at least.  That would assist what the historical inquiries commission in Northern Ireland and other bodies can do in many of the other cases.  We will continue to pursue the Geraldine Finucane case because it was part of an arrangement that was agreed in July 2001.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s indication that he will consider positively the proposal made by my colleague, Deputy Costello, that there be an agreed all-party motion on the Barron reports, which were debated in the House some weeks ago.  As the Taoiseach will recall, considerable disappointment was expressed by Justice for the Forgotten and the families of many victims that the House did not consider a motion to provide a means by which this issue could be progressed further.  I welcome that the Taoiseach is considering the proposal put to him by way of correspondence by Deputy Costello.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was recently reported that the Chief State Solicitor had changed the Government&rsquo;s pleadings in the case being taken against the State by a number of the families of the victims.  I <Col N="500"/>understand he wrote to the families&rsquo; legal representatives stating: &ldquo;The defendants are now withdrawing the plea contained in the defence dated 2 March 2005 that the holding of a public inquiry at this time would be futile and/or impractical.&rdquo;  Do I understand from that that the Government&rsquo;s position has changed regarding the holding of a public inquiry, which was sought originally by the Justice for the Forgotten group?  What significance are we to attach to the change in the Government&rsquo;s pleadings in that case?</P>
        <P>With regard to the Seamus Ludlow murder, the Taoiseach had a meeting with the Ludlow family on 22 January last and again it was reported subsequently that the Attorney General would consider the family&rsquo;s request for a public inquiry and would make a final decision on that within three weeks.  The three weeks have elapsed and the Taoiseach, in response to an earlier question, indicated the Attorney General is still considering the issues discussed at the meeting.  Will he confirm consideration is being given to a public inquiry in this case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The position on the first case has not changed.  Is the Deputy referring to the O&rsquo;Neill case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no change in the State&rsquo;s position on this but a new defence has been lodged based on the undertakings of confidentiality that have been given by third parties.  However, for any public inquiry to succeed, it is clear the co-operation of the British authorities is essential and the Oireachtas committee has acknowledged that.  We have used all the appropriate means to ensure such co-operation and a public inquiry in this State without the co-operation of the British Government will not resolve the outstanding questions.  In the final analysis, as the Oireachtas joint committee said, questions relating to allegations such as this can only be dealt with by the British Government.</P>
        <P>Two issues arise in the Ludlow case.  We had a useful, lengthy meeting with family representatives where a great deal of information, many assessments, including what emerged at the Barron commission, and other data were exchanged.  The first issue is to try to get the chief superintendent to bring the reinvestigation of the case to fruition.  That is due to finish this month and I am awaiting the report.  The second issue is a public inquiry here.  In fairness to the family representatives, they were only seeking a brief, focused and narrow procedural inquiry.  The question is whether that can be formulated.  The family, myself and the legal representative did not want to open this up.  The legal representative asked to meet the Attorney General in his office to see if it is possible to achieve a narrow framework and tight procedural deadlines.  That meeting has taken place but there are ongoing issues.  I inquired about this yesterday and I understand discussions have taken place.  Contacts are continuing but the Attorney General is not convinced at this stage that that kind of narrow focused inquiry with definite guidelines can be achieved.  That is our advice for now.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year the Garda Commissioner announced that he would set up a cold case unit within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate approximately 200 unsolved murders in the State.  Are the Dublin and Monaghan bombings included in that investigation and does the Taoiseach consider that a useful way of reopening the investigation into those murders?  Perhaps the advances that have been made in forensic science in the 30 or more years since the bombings will be brought to bear on a reopening of the investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="501"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Subsequent to the Barron report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the Oireachtas joint committee&rsquo;s report, the Garda re-examined all the recommendations made therein.  I am not certain whether that was completed or if the Garda made a report but I will check that with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Garda revisited the matter because, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said earlier, the difficulty with that investigation was that, while the bombings occurred in the middle of May, the official investigation closed in the middle of August of the same year.  I will inquire of the Minister whether that investigation came to an end or if anything new came to light from it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>A couple of weeks ago the Taoiseach was in Manchester where, among a number of other high profile activities, he met the UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown.  In the context of the new relationship between Ireland and Britain, the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, which everybody supports, the allegations of collusion which were debated in this House a couple of weeks ago are central issues.  If we are to have an Ireland that lives at peace with itself North and South, east and west, and which allows its various communities to develop, a number of fundamental matters must be addressed.</P>
        <P>Did the Taoiseach raise with the Prime Minister the British Government&rsquo;s practice during the time of the former Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and previously of withholding information that was relevant to the bombings and allegations of collusion between security forces and persons involved in acts of terrorism?  If that is not addressed and the information is available in the British archives, it will be a running sore on the relationship between both countries.  Did the Taoiseach request the Prime Minister to demand that the latter&rsquo;s Government provide all the necessary documentation in order that the matter might be cleared up once and for all and, if so, what was the response?</P>
        <P>Did he raise the British lack of co-operation during the North-South Ministerial Council meeting in Dundalk, which I understand was quite successful?  That was an opportunity for the British Government to show its seriousness about cleansing the wound and bringing a conclusion to these matters, thereby allowing a strong relationship to be built for the future.</P>
        <P>Does he have a view on the refusal by his Department to provide documents to the tribunal investigating the murder of the RUC officers, Harry Breen and Bob Buchanan, which was also the subject of a report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s last question, I stated last week in a reply to Deputy Gilmore that the Smithwick tribunal will go to the High Court and the State will not resist that.  That is the process which must be undergone.  The papers from 1989 will be made available but the tribunal must go to the High Court to obtain them.</P>
        <P>The meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council was successful.  We did not discuss collusion because of the North-South nature of proceedings.  However, I spoke to Paul Murphy who, on behalf of the Prime Minister, now has special responsibility for the east-west relationship.  Mr. Murphy has been involved since the beginning of the negotiations on the Good Friday Agreement.  He co-chaired proceedings when Senator George Mitchell was involved.  Mr. Murphy is a key player and is very familiar with matters.  We have raised these issues and he is well aware of our stance in respect of them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I see it, several Ministers and Secretaries of State served under former Prime Minister Blair and some of them were more helpful than others.  Papers and documents that were readily available were provided by the NIO and the British Government.  I do not have any information which indicates that these have not been furnished.  A large number of papers were given, on the basis of strict confidentiality, to the MacEntee inquiry.</P><Col N="502"/>
        <P>The Deputy requested my view on this matter.  Most of the departmental records, as we know them, and other records have been given.  What have not been, and are unlikely to be, given are the files &mdash; if any &mdash; in the possession of MI5 and MI6, which have a strange system, to say the least.  I have dealt with many Ministers and Secretaries of State regarding how that system operates but I came across a number of Chinese walls.  I do not believe we will obtain a great deal from these sources.</P>
        <P>There were agreements in respect of some cases.  Rather than chasing all of these, we have concentrated our efforts on pursuing the Finucane case.  What has happened in recent years in this case is that the British do not like to deal with any of our officials in respect of it because we keep pursuing the same issues.  The position is that they are totally reluctant and politely unhelpful as regards making available the papers relating to collusion in the Finucane case.  I might be wrong but I believe a considerable amount of information relating to the case is available.  This is why we should continue to pursue it.  In any event it was part of a process agreed at Weston Park, which went to the Cory report.  Judge Cory could not have been a more independent person.  He was an eminently senior member of the Canadian judiciary, recognised throughout the world, and he did a great deal of work in respect of this matter.  Even while members of his family were ill, he continued with his work.</P>
        <P>Judge Cory made his report and it was internationally accepted and recognised by various judicial and legal interests.  Campaigns were launched and advertisements were placed in newspapers in the United States.  This matter was examined in Brussels and is being considered here.  A motion was put before the House and one was also put to the joint Houses of Congress in the United States.  However, the British will still not act.</P>
        <P>I have informed the British on many occasions that I do not believe anyone would be shocked by what might emerge from a report on the murder of Pat Finucane.  No one would be shocked because we all know what happened.  The stories of those to whom I have spoken about the matter are consistent.  As Deputy Kenny stated, it would do a great deal of good if such a report could be forthcoming.  I have shown my good faith and proceeded with the Smithwick inquiry into the terrible murders of Buchanan and Breen.  We will follow it through and it may have some knock-on effects into our system.  We are aware of that but we will follow those investigations truthfully but we are not getting the same response.  My tactic is to confine our efforts on this issue to the Finucane case rather than trying to follow several cases, which I do not believe we will get.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his answer in respect of the Smithwick inquiry.  I support that.</P>
        <P>Considering the record of British Governments over the years and centuries, they have always been meticulous at the very least in note-taking and recording, both internally in the affairs of this country over the centuries and internationally.  I have no doubt these records exist either in MI5, MI6 or both.</P>
        <P>Did either Prime Minister state to the Taoiseach that there were no records?  Did they ever say they could not be made available, indicating the records exist but they do not want to make them available?  Did they deny point blank that records ever existed?  If that is the case, it is a complete reversal of British and imperial policy over centuries, where they were always meticulous in note-taking about issues, tragedies and interference such as this.  Was such a comment ever made to the Taoiseach by his peer in the House of Commons or Downing Street?</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In employing special advisers, my Department complies with the provisions of the Public Service Management Act 1997 and the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, which lay down the terms and conditions of employment of special advisers.</P>
        <P>Under these Acts and on foot of Government orders, advisers are appointed to unestablished or temporary positions.  Furthermore, the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 apply to the appointment of special advisers and among other stipulations, it requires that they must leave office when the officeholder, to whom they are acting, ceases to hold office.  There has been no increase in the number of special advisers who assist me in dealing with the complexities and volume in Government business.  There has actually been a decrease of two.</P>
        <P>Press officers are appointed to my Department through open competition advertised throughout the Civil Service.  The Government press secretary and assistant Government press secretaries are appointed under the Department of Finance instructions relating to the appointment of ministerial private office staff.  The guidelines advise on a range of issues, including terms and conditions of contracts, the need for specific sanction of appointments and the requirement for exclusion orders.  These officers are appointed to their posts on the basis of their media backgrounds and expert knowledge.</P>
        <P>Likewise, in the employment of personal assistants and personal secretaries, my Department abides by the procedures laid out in the guidelines issued by the Department of Finance and we comply fully with the requirements of the guidelines by following all due process in their recruitment.</P>
        <P>Since the general election, four new political staff have been appointed to my Department.  They are the Government press secretary, a deputy Government press secretary and a special adviser to the Government Chief Whip.  The Green Party programme manager based in Government Buildings is not a member of staff in my Department but my Department has engaged a personal assistant to provide administrative assistance to him and the new deputy Government press secretary.</P><Col N="504"/>
        <P>Under the direction of the programme manager, the primary function of the special advisers is to monitor, facilitate and help secure the achievement of Government objectives and ensure effective co-ordination in the implementation of the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>They are also tasked with giving me advice and keeping me informed on a wide range of issues, including business, financial, economic, political, administrative and media matters and performing such other functions as may be directed by me from time to time.</P>
        <P>Each of the advisers liaises with a number of Departments and acts as a point of contact in my Department for Ministers and their advisers.  My advisers attend meetings of Cabinet committees and cross-departmental teams relevant to their responsibilities.  They also liaise, on my behalf, with organisations and interest groups outside of Government.</P>
        <P>Advisers assigned to the Government Chief Whip and the Minister of State provide advice to the Minister of State and monitor, facilitate and secure the achievement of Government objectives and relate to the Department of the Taoiseach as requested by the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>My programme manager meets with other ministerial advisers on a weekly basis and monitors and reports to me on progress in implementing the programme for Government.  On the recommendation of the Attorney General, Mr. Paul Gallagher, I appointed Mr. Francis Kieran as special assistant to the Attorney General to liaise between the Attorney General and me, and other Departments, on issues relevant to the programme for Government as well as to keep the Attorney General informed on items arising in the Oireachtas or the media which could impinge on, or be relevant to, his role.  The position of Attorney General is not a political one and Mr. Kieran does not provide political advice.</P>
        <P>I comply fully with the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2001 and annually lay the statements of interests, qualifications and relationship before the Houses of the Oireachtas on behalf of advisers, the Government press secretary, deputy Government press secretaries, personal secretaries and personal assistants, as required.  Each individual sends his or her return to the Standards in Public Office Commission in accordance with that legislation.</P>
        <P>Last year two such returns were made in accordance with the ethics legislation, one for the calendar year 2006 and one following the general election.  A further return was made last month covering the period from the general election to the end of 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What are the guidelines for limiting the numbers of staff to be appointed in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department or other Departments?  Does the Taoiseach agree that since 2002 the number of senior staff appointed directly to Ministers has gone up from 34 to 43?  The senior staff of the Minister for Education and Science, whom I welcome back to the House, did not increase whereas those of the Minister for Defence increased 100%, from one to two.  The Minister for Health and Children made six appointments in 2007 at a cost of &euro;666,561 at a time when nurses on maternity leave could not be replaced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What are the restrictions on Ministers appointing staff to their offices and all that carry on?  Is it true that there is a facility for every Minister to appoint 16 staff, including political advisers, programme managers, press officers, constituency people and so on?  What are the restraints on the Taoiseach?  His staff has been reduced from nine category one staff in 2002 to eight in 2007.  Maybe that person went to the Office of the Minister of Defence.  Are there restrictions or how does the Taoiseach tie the numbers back?  The Minister for Health and Children does not seem to know what is going on in her Department, yet she has six advisers who cost &euro;666,561 a year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>When he answered similar questions last November the Taoiseach gave a list of the political staff and advisers employed in his Department.  That does not include the staff employed in the constituency offices of the Taoiseach and respective Ministers of State.  The total cost of the staff in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department is just over &euro;1.5 million a year.  We have some idea of the value of that cost to the Taoiseach but what is the value of that cost to the taxpayer? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Taoiseach last answered questions on these matters, he stated that there was a close working relationship between the Department of Finance, the Health Service Executive, his Department and the Department of Health and Children in respect of health matters.  He advised me that one of his advisers attends a frequent series of meetings in that regard.  Will he clarify whether it is the same adviser who attends that series of meetings in relation to health matters?  Is it possible to identify that person and does he or she have a role in the formulation of policy in respect of health issues?  Is part of his or her function the drawing up of briefings and reports for the Taoiseach particularly in relation to health matters discussed and determined at these cross-departmental engagements?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Paragraph A13 of the Vote for my Department covers the estimated total cost of special advisers&rsquo; annual salaries, including the salary of my programme manager, which has been reduced from well over &euro;1 million to &euro;640,000 per annum because I have fewer advisers now.  I thought Deputy Gilmore would have noted this for me, to show how much I have reduced it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason is that as I no longer deal with the day to day issues on Northern Ireland, I do not need as many people.  I have a programme manager and three special advisers who are covered across the Department.  All the staff in my constituency office, except for one junior position, are civil servants.  I have given the information on press officers.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question, all Ministers are subject to the Department of Finance guidelines.  There is one programme manager per party and one adviser per Minister.  A limited number of Ministers of State, based on their responsibilities, have an adviser.  The number of senior positions has been reduced quite significantly.  Years ago my Department had ten contracted advisers, programme managers and special advisers, not including the special Office of the T&aacute;naiste.  During the last Government, there were 26 contracted advisers, programmer managers and special advisers across all Departments, a number of whom were seconded civil servants.  The number of senior positions at present stands at 24 compared with 55 a decade ago, which constitutes a huge decrease.  However, perhaps Deputy Gilmore is right and we should employ more.  However, I will try to resist that.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.</P>
        <P>The European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic is being mounted in response to a direct request from the United Nations Security Council.  This is the most widely supported military operation conducted in Africa by the EU.  France will be making a sizeable contribution to the EU force of 3,700.  However, France will be only one of 14 EU troop contributors on the ground in the mission area.  When staff in the operational headquarters in Paris are taken into account, more than 20 EU member states will be represented, including the three EU neutrals, Sweden, Austria and Finland.  Ireland is expected to be the second largest contributor of troops to the mission, which aims to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and internally displaced persons, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and protect UN personnel.  The mandate for this mission is robust and will be conducted under Chapter VII of the UN charter.  EUFOR is committed to conducting its operations in a neutral and impartial manner and operates in full co-operation with the United Nations.</P>
        <P>On 2 February 2008, a Sudanese-backed rebel column, consisting of 300 pick-up vehicles, each with ten to 15 combatants, advanced on Chad&rsquo;s capital, N&rsquo;Djamena.  Intense fighting ensued between the rebels and the Chadian forces on 2 and 3 February 2008.  The situation in N&rsquo;Djamena is now reported to be calm and the Chadian Government is in control.  The recent incursion by rebel forces is a matter for the Chadian authorities and does not fall within the remit of the EU mission.</P>
        <P>As for the threat posed to Irish troops to be deployed as part of the EU force, the military authorities have assessed the recent actions by rebel forces as an attempt to influence the situation on the ground prior to the EUFOR deployment.  While at least one rebel group has declared that it considers itself in a state of war against the French or any foreign army on Chad&rsquo;s territory, it is thought unlikely that it will attempt to engage with EUFOR troops.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that ongoing threat assessments are carried out in mission areas and the Department continually reviews both personal equipment and force assets to ensure Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfil their roles.  The planned deployment to Chad will be no different.  While no mission is without danger, I am satisfied that all appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the safety of all Defence Forces personnel serving overseas.</P><Col N="507"/>
        <P>On 13 February 2008, I visited the mission&rsquo;s operation headquarters, OHQ, in Paris and met the operation commander, Lieutenant General Pat Nash.  He briefed me on the current situation and the plans for recommencement of deployment of EUFOR troops to the mission area.</P>
        <P>Lieutenant General Nash confirmed that the situation in Chad has now stabilised.  However, the urgent necessity to provide security and protection to the refugees and displaced persons in camps remains.  While mindful of the need to minimise risk, I re-affirmed the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to the humanitarian objectives of the deployment.</P>
        <P>Lieutenant General Nash also assured me that the broad range of capabilities required to deploy the EU force has now been generated.  He also informed me that a total of three role 2 medical facilities, plus air assets, will be provided.  In addition, each battalion will have its own role 1 medical facility.</P>
        <P>Deployment of EUFOR personnel to Chad commenced on 12 February 2008.  Lieutenant General Nash is confident that the capabilities required to support EUFOR&rsquo;s main force deployment will be established by mid-March 2008.  By this time, he is planning that the mission will achieve initial operational capability, with at least 1,200 troops in theatre.  Planning for the follow-on deployment of all three multinational battalions, including the Irish battalion, can then commence.  The logistics of deploying the multinational battalions require extensive planning as the vast majority of equipment etc. will arrive in Douala port in Cameroon and will be transported from there to the relevant operational sector.  Lieutenant General Nash is satisfied the OHQ will have the necessary logistical arrangements in place to accommodate this.  Ireland and Sweden will be the first of the multinationals to deploy.  The mission is planned to reach full operational capability by mid-May 2008.</P>
        <P>A total of eight members of the Permanent Defence Force are currently deployed with the mission in Chad.  All are reported to be safe and well.  A Defence Forces engineering reconnaissance party travelled to Chad yesterday to examine the requirement to put in place the necessary infrastructure to enable the deployment of the Irish battalion to Goz Beida in south-eastern Chad.</P>
        <P>The deployment of approximately 50 Army Ranger Wing personnel to the mission area is scheduled for tomorrow.  It is expected the main deployment of approximately 400 Irish troops to the mission area will be completed by mid to late May 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister take seriously the threat posed by the spokesperson for the rebel forces?  Does the Minister agree that in the recent attack on the capital, the rebel forces displayed more organisation, showed better capability and were more highly mobile than had been thought previously?  Has an effort been made to contact the aforementioned spokesperson, who appears to be able to speak freely to the media, including the Irish media, to assure the group in question that the Irish are an impartial force despite being on the same mission as the French?  It does not mean they have the same historical connection with Chad as do the French.  Moreover, what public information campaign, if any, is under way in Chad at present to confirm Irish impartiality and that their deployment to Chad is purely on humanitarian grounds to protect internally displaced persons and refugees from Sudan?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I take all threats seriously.  As I noted in my initial reply, there always will be a certain element of danger.  This is a Chapter VII operation and is similar to any operation in a troubled African country such as, for example, Liberia, where great fears were expressed in advance of the mission but which ultimately worked out very well.  This statement was made by a representative of one rebel group.  As Deputy Deenihan is aware, there is a number of rebel groups, which appear to agree on one thing only, namely, a change of govern<Col N="508"/>ment.  Their political objectives and to an extent even their military objectives appear to be widely diverse.</P>
        <P>In addition, there also is a number of roving bands of what one would describe as bandits rather than rebels.  They operate on the Chadian-Sudanese border and appear to pose the greatest threat.  One must put this matter into context.  This was a single statement by one spokesman for one of many rebel groups that operate in Chad. Although I agree with Deputy Deenihan that the rebels displayed more military ability than had been anticipated in their recent operations, they did not attempt to engage the French forces, who were present flying the French flag, nor did they interfere with any EU forces, to whom they were in close proximity.  This indicates that their targets, apart from the Administration in Chad, are generally soft targets, such as unarmed civilians, aid workers etc.  They are most unwilling to confront any army that is properly constituted and armed.</P>
        <P>The force commander, his staff, all members of the Government and other Irish parties who speak on this matter are at pains to point out that this is a humanitarian mission.  We have no brief for either the Government in Chad or the rebels.  Our sole aim is to protect the unfortunate victims of the conflict in Darfur and those across the border in Chad and the Central African Republic.</P>
        <P>I have the greatest confidence in the commander of the multinational force, an Irish general called Pat Nash.  He has considerable experience and is highly capable.  He decided he would wait until sufficient logistical supports and enablers were put in place to ensure the mission would be as safe as it could possibly be made.  That is his duty and he has kept us informed throughout.  It is our job to provide sufficient protection for the troops and to ensure they are trained sufficiently to ensure they will remain safe in this hostile environment.  We have done so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I take it from his remarks that the safety and security of our troops is paramount and that he is satisfied the 50 rangers who are embarking tomorrow will have sufficient protection.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister believe an event similar to that which occurred in N&rsquo;Djamena could happen again?  It is a question of the capability of the Irish troops to withstand any attacks and of ensuring their general safety.  Am I correct in believing the troops are as safe as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>That is precisely the point.  There will be no circumstances in which there will be no element of danger.  We are entering a very troubled African country in a more or less constant state of rebellion.  The rebellion is supported by Chad&rsquo;s powerful neighbour, Sudan, whose regime is in turn supported by the Government of China.  There are constant efforts to disrupt the political system in Chad and one could not, under any circumstances, describe the circumstances that obtain as not being attended by some degree of danger.  Deputy O&rsquo;Shea analysed the matter very well in stating we have made conditions for our troops as safe as possible under the circumstances. </P>
        <P>On the question of a possible repeat of the incident in N&rsquo;Djamena a couple of weeks ago, my information suggests the rebels were decisively defeated, dispersed and forced to retreat towards the Sudanese border.  The rebels, who are in two different groups, have not yet crossed the border and are still in Chad.  Military intelligence suggests they would be quite incapable of mounting another operation this side of the rainy season, which begins in the first week of June.  It will not be practical to operate during that season and it will, therefore, be the latter part of the year before they are capable of posing a threat again.  In view of the fact that the rebels are supported strongly by Sudan and China, of which there is ample evidence, anything is possible.  They may attack again.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="509"/>

	<P>I understand the rebels have regrouped and captured a town in Chad.  Is the Minister aware of this?  Given that China is playing a major role in supporting Sudan, has the Irish Government made any direct approach to the Chinese ambassador regarding his country&rsquo;s involvement with a view to influencing what is happening in Chad?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I understood there were four rebel groups involved in the recent attack on the capital.  Are there other rebel groups that can avail of the same type of support in mounting similar operations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>There are other rebel groups but I do not believe they would be as capable of mounting similar operations.  They are more like bandit groups.   They operate opportunistically, join together and dissipate fairly quickly.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s question, my information is that the rebels who attacked N&rsquo;Djamena will not be in a position to make a comeback until the end of the rainy season.</P>
        <P>Approaches to the Chinese authorities would be quite futile because the Administrations of both China and Sudan have stated publicly they have nothing at all to do with the rebels in Chad.  At a diplomatic level, we must take China&rsquo;s word for it, although we might have information to the contrary.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> the projected total cost of the air transport required to transport and logistically support the Defence Forces deployment to Chad. </Quest>
        <QRef>[6829/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed deployment of a Defence Forces contingent to the UN-mandated EU operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic will be the most expensive operation on which the Defence Forces have ever been deployed.</P>
        <P>As the House will be aware, Chad is landlocked and nearly 2,000 km from the nearest port facility. There are few, if any, roads and little infrastructure over which to transport personnel or equipment.  It is, therefore, essential that the contingent be completely self-contained and capable of undertaking its operations without depending on the availability of immediate re-supply or reinforcement.  Owing to the remote location of the mission&rsquo;s area of operations, deployment and re-supply of the contingent will be mainly by air and therefore expensive.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that the cost to the Department of Defence Vote arising from the Defence Forces&rsquo; participation in this mission for 12 months will amount to approximately &euro;57 million, including Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;1.3 million contribution to common costs.  Provision to meet the additional costs of the operation has been made in the Department of Defence Estimate for 2008.  Preliminary estimates indicate that the cost of transportation of Defence Forces personnel and equipment to the mission area, including re-supply and rotation flights, will be in the region of &euro;20 million.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that participating in this mission will present many challenges for the men and women of the Defence Forces but the Government is committed to ensuring that all of the necessary resources are provided.  While the expenses associated with the mission are substantial, the mission will be undertaking a vital task in providing basic security for over 400,000 refugees, many of whom are fleeing the crisis in Darfur.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the cost of transport include the cost of providing helicopters from the Irish zone to Abeche, where the Italian hospital will be located?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  Deployment of the initial entry force will cost &euro;3.8 million, the initial deployment of the main contingent will cost &euro;10 million, rotation flights will cost &euro;2.4 million and re-supply flights will cost &euro;3.4 million.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="510"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be three rotations.  How many re-supply flights will there be in total, taking into account ammunition, medical services etc?  If a casualty requires treatment in Ireland, will there be transport available immediately?  When there is a serious accident, one is supposed to get from where it occurred to a hospital within seven hours.  Will this be possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I stated that, of the total of &euro;20 million, &euro;2.4 million will be spent on rotation flights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about the helicopter backup service that will be available for medical purposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  I assure the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the provision of the service built into that cost?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not built into that cost but the Deputy can be assured that three Role 2 medical facilities are being provided and they will include Medevac facilities, both air and ground facilities, to take people to hospital as necessary.  There will also be facilities to fly people outside the Sudan if necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Irish mission have dedicated helicopter capability or will it rely on others?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>No particular group making up the multinational force has dedicated helicopter capability.  The area is divided into a number of zones.  The capabilities are provided centrally and they will be available equally to all the participants in the mission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The distance between Abeche and where the Irish troops will be operating is approximately 160 km.  The guideline is that it would take an hour for a helicopter to fly from there to the Irish zone to transport casualties or personnel affected by disease and an hour for it to travel back.  Therefore, it would be preferable if the Irish troops had a helicopter on site to enable them to bring personnel, where necessary, to a level two hospital.  Has the Minister provided for that possibility?</P>

        <asker>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> if a cost benefit analysis was conducted on the decentralisation of elements of his Department to Newbridge and elements of the Defence Forces headquarters to the Defence Forces training centre in the Curragh Camp; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[6830/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance announced in his budget speech in December 2003 that a total of eight Departments would move their headquarters from Dublin to provincial locations.  As part of this programme, all my Department&rsquo;s Dublin-based Civil Service staff are relocating to Newbridge and the Defence Forces headquarters will relocate to the Curragh.  In coming to its decision on decentralisation, the Government took account of a wide range of factors in selecting suitable locations and Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>Immediately following the announcement of the programme, a decentralisation implementation group was appointed to prepare an overall implementation plan in consultation with all the organisations involved, including my Department.  My Department has produced implementation plans for the group, setting out the detailed arrangements that will be put in place for relocation, such as risk assessment and mitigation strategies, service and business continuity, and business processes and systems.  These plans are being progressed in preparation for the move.  The relocation of my Department to Newbridge and of the Defence Forces headquarters to the Curragh will take place in 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Given that the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are currently co-located in Glasnevin and Infirmary Road, surely the fact that the various <Col N="512"/>functions and roles of both will be split, with one being located in the Curragh and the other in Newbridge, will not lead to good administration.  In terms of functionality, would it not have been preferable if a single relocation was made to Newbridge rather than splitting the two bodies?  Was a cost benefit analysis carried out prior to this decision being made?  The Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces will be based in Newbridge while most of his staff will be based in the Curragh.  In terms of administrative purposes alone and the flow of information, and given the proximity in which the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces work, this move will create many problems down the road.  It is probably too late to change the decision, but I question how well it was thought through.  Surely it would have been preferable for the Government to opt for one location, and well and good if that is Newbridge given the spin-off that would result from the relocation, but dividing the two bodies in terms of location will lead to many logistical problems down the road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, Newbridge and the Curragh are quite close to each other.  We live in the age of instant communications.  The Chief of Staff and more than 40 personnel, including two deputy chiefs of staff, will be co-located with the Department in Newbridge.  We have had extensive discussions with the military and the Civil Service about this matter and they are quite happy with the arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is probably the first time this Department will be split.  The feedback I got from some of the staff affected is that they are concerned about the future operational aspect of this arrangement. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy says that, I must take his word for it, but I have always shown myself to be open to representatives.  If anybody in the military or the Department has anything to say to me, he or she can come and say it to me, and I have not heard one word of complaint about this.</P>

        <Quest> the progress made on providing a workplace child care facility in the Curragh Camp; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[6831/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>A request to provide cr&egrave;che facilities for members of the Defence Forces has been made by the Defence Forces representative associations.  The Defence Forces partnership steering group, which was established following from Partnership 2000, has tasked a partnership sub-committee with examining the issue of the provision of child care facilities under a number of headings, including demand for places, location and cost.  A report from the sub-committee on the feasibility of undertaking such a project is awaited. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This report has been awaited for almost a year.  Will the Minister place more urgency on demanding completion of this report? </P>
        <P>The Minister made great play out of trying to attract more females into the Defence Forces and he launched a campaign in that respect some time ago.  Female members deserve a family-friendly workplace and for younger women, in particular recently married women, surely a child care facility in the workplace is critical in attracting more women into the Defence Forces.  Such a facility is one of the many incentives the Minister must ensure is put in place.  I appeal to the Minister to make such provision a priority and to ensure that this committee, which has been lingering for almost the past year in its work on this project, reports to him as soon as possible.  He should set a deadline for completion of this report.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="513"/>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make inquiries about that.  I understand the committee will report on it shortly.  For a positive decision to be taken, we would have to be satisfied that the demand for such a facility would justify the capital expenditure because it would involve not only premises but equipment etc.  We would also want to be satisfied that its operation would be self-financing as the other six State cr&egrave;ches, provided under the Civil Service provision of cr&egrave;che scheme, are expected to be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of such a facility being self-financing, it would not require a great deal of money.  I understand that there is a space in the Curragh that could be easily adapted for this type of facility.  The main cost probably would be on the employment of personnel rather than the creation of a new space for the facility or the use of special equipment, bearing in mind that the equipment required for cr&egrave;che facilities is generally not very expensive.  Right across the public service cr&egrave;ches are available, even for people in this House I understand.  I do not believe that expense should necessarily be a deterrent for the provision of this facility, which is being demanded by military personnel. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>My information is that only six cr&egrave;ches are being provided across the public service, each with about 30 places, which is relatively small in the general scheme of things, and they are all expected to be self-financing. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 113, 118, 126, 129, 130, 131, 136, 144, 154, 157, 164, 166 and 613 to 615, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>The European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, established under the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1778 (2007), was formally launched by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 28 January 2008.  Ireland is expected to be the second largest contributor of troops to the <Col N="515"/>mission, which aims to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and internally displaced persons, IDPs, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and protect UN personnel.</P>
        <P>The mandate for this mission is robust and will be conducted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, allowing the use of all necessary force to ensure the success of the mission.  The EU force is authorised to support the UN and to take all necessary measures, within its capabilities and its area of operation, to fulfil its functions.  EUFOR is committed to conducting its operations in a neutral and impartial manner.</P>
        <P>Given the nature of the operation and the mission area and environment, force protection will be a key consideration.  The Defence Forces will deploy a full range of force protection assets including armoured personnel carriers.  The military authorities have indicated that, while the level of risk is consistent with any operational deployment in a troubled African state, it is one which the Defence Forces have the capability to manage.</P>
        <P>On 13 February 2008, I visited the operation headquarters, OHQ, in Paris for the European Union&rsquo;s military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD/RCA.  I met with the operation commander, Lieutenant General Pat Nash, who briefed me on the current situation and the plans for recommencement of deployment of EUFOR troops to the mission area.</P>
        <P>Lieutenant General Nash indicated that the situation in Chad has now stabilised.  The urgent necessity to provide security and protection to the refugees and displaced persons in camps, however, remains.  While mindful of the need to minimise risk, I re-affirmed the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to the humanitarian objectives of EUFOR TCHAD/RCA.</P>
        <P>Lieutenant General Nash also assured me that the broad range of capabilities required to deploy the EU force has now been generated.  He also informed me that a total of three role two medical facilities, plus air assets, will be provided.  In addition, each battalion will have its own role one medical facilities.</P>
        <P>Deployment of EUFOR personnel recommenced on 12 February 2008, having been postponed by the operation commander earlier this month due to the recent events in Chad.  Lieutenant General Nash is confident that the capabilities required to support EUFOR&rsquo;s main force deployment will be established by mid-March 2008, by which time he plans that the mission will achieve initial operational capability.  At this stage, he expects to have at least 1,200 troops in theatre.  This will afford the operation commander and his staff the opportunity to plan for the follow on deployment of three multi-national battalions, including the Irish battalion.  The mission is planned to reach full operational capability by mid to late May 2008.</P>
        <P>Eight members of the Permanent Defence Force are currently with the mission in Chad and, as I have already indicated, are all reported to be safe and well.  The deployment of some 50 Army ranger wing, ARW, personnel to the mission area, which was due to take place earlier this month, is now scheduled for tomorrow.  It is expected that the main deployment of some 400 Irish troops to the mission area will be completed by mid-May 2008.</P>
        <P>I have already dealt with the cost.  It will be approximately &euro;57 million.  Provision is made annually in the Defence Vote to maintain a capacity of 850 personnel serving overseas at any one time.  This includes making provision for overseas allowance payments and other costs associated with maintaining troops overseas.  The Defence Estimate includes additional funding of &euro;37 million for the proposed mission to Chad, the bulk of which will be expended on transport costs.  This additional funding will ensure that our troops in Chad will have the best possible equipment and facilities in what will be a very challenging environment.</P>
        <P>In connection with depreciation figures, it is extremely difficult to forecast this cost.  The operating environment will be harsh on all assets, including human, vehicle, accommodation <Col N="516"/>units, personal equipment, radios and generators, to list but a few.  It is considered that this type of forecasting will only be viable after the impact of a full deployment in theatre has been concluded.  It is not possible at this stage to provide precise figures on the asset value of all equipment being deployed.</P>
        <P>Defence Forces personnel deployed to Chad will be able to avail of Internet services and telephone communications via satellite.  The Defence Forces will provide all personnel with access to a dedicated phone system for communications back to Ireland and all personnel will be provided with monthly liberty call credit.  This will ensure that they are able to keep in contact with their families in Ireland on a regular basis.  The postal situation, and its roll-out, is yet to be confirmed by the force headquarters.  This will probably be a rudimentary system taking into account the very extended lines of communication from home.</P>
        <P>The full range of welfare services, access to gymnasiums and allied recreational facilities has been provided for in the planning associated with the deployment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to refer to the question in the name of Deputy Richard Bruton as regards medical care facilities.  Will the Minister say what level one and level two care is available to the Irish troops?  I have asked this question already, but I want some clarity in this regard.  As level two care provides for a field hospital, how will injured personnel travel from their own zone to Abeche where the level two hospital will be located?  The European Union&rsquo;s recommended guideline is one hour, but they will not have their own helicopter to do that, in which case it could take two hours.  When it comes to level three, which is for very serious casualties, how can the Minister assure the House that such injured personnel can be brought back to Ireland within the recommended timeframe of seven hours?  Do we have that capability?  I have a large number of questions. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come back to the Deputy in one minute, although he has had a minute and a half already.  A number of Deputies want to ask questions. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The level one medical facilities include first aid, immediate life saving measures and triage.  Three role two facilities will be available, in N&rsquo;Djamena, Abeche and Birao in the Central African Republic.  That will cover such matters as advanced life support, basic surgery, intensive care with limited patient holding capacity and primary health care.  In addition, ancillary laboratory and radiology facilities, a dental unit and other hospital support elements with appropriate ground and air medevac capabilities will support this provision.  I have discussed the issue of getting people to role two hospitals with the force commander and he has assured me all the necessary arrangements will be in place in that regard. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ChrisAndrews"><NameTxt>Deputy Chris Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Minister has had discussions with Lieutenant General Nash.  Will the Minister outline what the force commander views as the main threat to Irish troops?  Is the Minister reassured and satisfied as to the safety of Irish troops?  Last week, the Minister met with the noted Darfur human rights activist and EU peace prize winner, Salih Osman.  I am interested in his comments on that meeting.  Finally, he said that this mission would protect refugees.  I wonder whether there is any special role in terms of protecting those who are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>This can change, but I am advised that the main threat at the moment are these groups of roving bandits, rather than rebels, who use four-by-four pick-up trucks and operate opportunistically.  They are mainly active along the Chad-Sudanese border and tend to come together and dissipate fairly quickly.  This is the main threat at the moment.  As to whether <Col N="517"/>I am satisfied that everything that can be done has been done to ensure the safety of our troops, I am.</P>
      
        <P>The Deputy is correct that I met Mr. Osman last week.  He informed me of the great respect for Ireland&rsquo;s peacekeeping record.  He said it is absolutely vital that this mission goes ahead on humanitarian grounds, considering the level of suffering and threat to the people in the camps there.  He also referred to recent comments by former President Mary Robinson which he welcomed.  He also welcomed her visit to the area and her comments to the effect it was imperative that this mission go ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has reiterated his belief that every possible measure has been put in place and will be put in place to ensure the security and safety of our troops.  He lays emphasis on the fact that this is a mission to protect civilians.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>An issue I have raised with the Minister in the past is the attempt by the so-called charity, Zoe&rsquo;s Ark, to take out of the area 103 children who were being presented as orphans.  Since I last raised the issue, the court case has happened and sentences are in place.  To what extent can the EU force play a positive role in protecting children and preventing any such attempts being made again to take children out of the country?  These children were presented as orphans when it seems clear that they were not and this is quite worrying.  I know the situation is chaotic with approximately 400,000 refugees and displaced Chadians in the area.  Has the Minister discussed this matter with the force commander and what positive contribution can the force make in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy O&rsquo;Shea has noted, chaotic hardly begins to describe the situation.  I have discussed that specific matter with the force commander.  It is my earnest hope that we will be able to make a difference in that regard and that we will be in a position to prevent a recurrence.</P>
        <P>When Deputy O&rsquo;Shea raised the question of children, it reminded me that I had not replied to one of the supplementary questions from his predecessor which related to trafficking.  My understanding of the situation is that trafficking such as child trafficking is primarily a matter for the authorities in Chad, the Chadian Government, to deal with.  It is also my understanding that the UN mandate is sufficiently broad to enable the UN forces to intervene if this activity is brought to their attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am mindful of the risks and dangers associated with the mission which our troops are undertaking.  However, I do not believe we should be sensationalist and any unfounded claims will only serve to upset or undermine the confidence of the families of those associated with the mission.  With that in mind I ask the Minister to state what equipment will be accompanying the troops to Chad.  What costs are covered by the estimate of &euro;57 million referred to by the Minister?  I ask him to provide a breakdown of the transport costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Collins that while we must be conscious of the fact that it is a dangerous mission and we need to keep this to the forefront of our considerations at all times, we do not wish to emphasise it too much out of consideration for the families of those who are going abroad into a very hostile environment.</P>
        <P>In reply to Deputy Collins&rsquo;s question about equipment, the force is taking 17 Mowag APCs, four special reconnaissance vehicles, the appropriate supply of heavy machine-guns, the usual supply of indirect fire capabilities such as mortars and various other types of force protection equipment.  The force will also take a large amount of construction equipment such as drop trucks and fork-lifts because it will be necessary to do a lot of building out there<b>.</b>  A con<Col N="518"/>tainerised medical facility and a containerised maintenance facility will also be brought.  I am informed it will take approximately 20 flights to transport the amount of equipment.</P>
        <P>I indicated to Deputy Deenihan in an earlier reply the breakdown of costs.  The cost of transport alone will be &euro;20 million, broken down as follows &mdash; a total of &euro;3.8 million for the deployment of the initial entry force; the initial deployment of the main contingent will cost &euro;10 million; rotation flights, &euro;2.4 million; and resupply flights, &euro;3.4 million.  This is quite an expensive operation but in my view, the humanitarian situation warrants it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me time to ask a question.</P>
        <P>Last Wednesday the Minister met with General Nash<b> </b>in Paris.  Following the meeting it was reported extensively that the mission had been delayed twice because of a lack of medical and logistical resources<b>.</b>  The Minister said that all these logistical and medical issues had been resolved.  My information is that this is not the case and that this is far from the truth<b>.</b></P>
        <P>I refer to the transportation of the main contingent of the Irish troops from the west African coast to Chad.  As of now, my information is that no transport arrangements have been made.  This mission should have begun last month.  No contracts have been signed and as of today, Western Command does not know who will transport its men and equipment from the west African coast to Chad over the course of three or four weeks.  A half an hour ago the Minister stated it was General Nash&rsquo;s responsibility to provide logistical support but it is also this Government&rsquo;s responsibility to provide that logistical support.  As the Minister stated last week, if it is the case that no logistical issues are outstanding, can he tell me who will transport the main contingent of Irish troops from the west African coast to Chad?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I said last week that General Nash had reassured me that the medical and logistical matters had been sorted out to his satisfaction.  He is the force commander&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>So the Minister does not know?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>He is the force commander and I take his word for it.  What would the Deputy do in that situation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would ask him.</P>

	<P>I did ask him.</P>

	<P>A Leas Cheann-Comhairle, you took approximately 15 questions together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid that is the Minister&rsquo;s prerogative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we should have time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask his supplementary question because we have only a few minutes left. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding our air transport capability, does the fact that the Government is spending approximately &euro;20 million on leasing aircraft not make the case for having our own air transport capability?  Owing to the costs involved, which will probably exceed &euro;20 million before the end of the mission in Chad, is it something the Government would seriously consider?  Regarding Question No. 131, the Minister mentioned that there is &euro;37 million in the Estimates.  The total cost of the mission will be &euro;57 million.  From where will the shortfall of &euro;20 million be made up?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>My reply may have been somewhat confusing.  When we were given our original estimate we would have been able to provide &euro;20 million from our own resources to Chad.  We needed an extra &euro;37 million because the total cost of the mission is &euro;57 million.  I am sorry if that was not presented as clearly as it should have been.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is that money coming from?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It is coming from the Defence Forces.  There is an increase of 7% in the Defence Forces budget this year over last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it result in any cutbacks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely not.  There is an increase of 7%.  We have made the usual provision for expanding accommodation, training, equipment etc. as we have done for several years.  Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s other point, which he has made before, it appears to make a case for getting our own long-range transportation facility.  The Department has considered the matter a number of times and the advice to date is that we have insufficient use to justify the expenditure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We could use it for humanitarian aid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>We could, but that would be a joint operation between the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs.  We are considering the matter in the context of the next ten-year plan for defence, which we will start to consider shortly.  At the moment, we have arrangements, as the Deputy knows, with commercial providers in the private sector.  Recently another potential provider approached me with a view to being added, which might bring down the cost further.  I have passed the name and contact details to officials in the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Apart from the issue of costs, I take it the Minister will have gathered there is certain concern, admittedly expressed in different ways, among Members of this House regarding the safety and security of our troops going to Chad.  As one who shares those con<Col N="522"/>cerns, could the Minister outline the most up-to-date risk assessment of the situation?  Has it been taken into account that the rebels have, as I understand, in recent weeks been reinforced from the other side of the border in Darfur by those who support them?  These reinforcements have been financed and encouraged by the Sudanese Government in Khartoum.  Does the Minister not accept that the risk situation is quite fluid and the factors there are such that the risks could over a period of time increase substantially?  Has all that been taken into account in making the final decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, all that has been taken very much into account.  As the Deputy will be aware, we constantly assess the risk.  It is not just a question of assessing the risk today and leaving the matter for another three months.  The risk is constantly assessed.  There is a constant risk assessment operation in place.  The Deputy asked whether recent events regarding the alleged regrouping of the rebels had been taken into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Reinforcements have crossed the border in recent days.</P>

	<P>In the past ten years the population of this city has increased by more than 100,000, and the populations of counties Meath and Kildare and the area immediately outside Dublin have increased by another 100,000.  Throughout that period, as the Taoiseach will be aware, the space given over to quality bus corridors has been quite limited, with a limited increase in the number of buses provided.  Four county managers appeared before last week&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and complained about the lack of space being allocated to quality bus corridors and the lack of buses in their areas.</P>
        <P>Last Sunday the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, announced in his usual way that the Government was abandoning its policy of competition on bus routes.  The Minister now seems happy for the hard-pressed commuters, who are central to the life of the city, to need to continue to rely on a single bus provider for transport to and from their localities.  More important, as the Taoiseach is only too well aware, the outlying areas such as Tallaght, Edenmore, Raheny, and Poppintree, where the service is really not as it should be, are now really caught.  The limited competition that has been provided has worked exceptionally well and those who use it are happy about it because it resulted in all public transport providers lifting their game, which is right and proper.</P>
        <P>Why has the Government turned its back on what has been Government policy for ten years?  What is so unique about Dublin Bus that commuters will need to continue to rely on a single bus provider in this city and its outlying areas?  If competition has worked so well in airlines, why is it not applied in the case of buses, which would have the interests of the commuter at heart in terms of ease of access, convenience of travel and greater opportunities, allowing the life of the city to thrive?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government for the past ten years, as Deputy Kenny has said, has continued both to put in more buses &mdash; we have 1,100 more buses on the road &mdash; and we have continued on certain routes to allow additional licences for private operators.  We are committed to seeing the further expansion and enhancement of public bus services.  We want to see a top class service delivered to all citizens.  As I said when talking about infrastructural issues during Question Time last Wednesday, we are wholeheartedly committed to getting best value for the travelling public and the taxpayer from significant subsidies being invested by the Exchequer in public bus services operated by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  In order to achieve this we have set out a number of priorities in the programme for government, which contains a commitment to expedite the establishment of the Dublin transport authority.  Hopefully that legislation will be before us very soon.  It will have the necessary powers to ensure the delivery of an integrated public transport system that was envisioned under Transport 21.  These powers of the DTA will not be limited.  They will help with a lot of the difficulties that managers have cited concerning corridors and infrastructural projects.  That Bill will be before the House in the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government also includes a commitment to improve bus services under Transport 21 by reforming the bus licensing provisions of the Transport Act 1932, and to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants, both public and private.  That is the Government&rsquo;s policy.  Proposals for a new bus licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislative proposals.  In the meantime, it will be business as usual for all private operators who wish to apply for a licence.  There is no change <Col N="524"/>under the present system whereby, as the Deputy said, there is more competition and many services have been enhanced.  That position will continue.</P>
        <P>In terms of the subvented bus market, which is supported by Exchequer moneys, the Dublin transport authority Bill will set out mechanisms for awarding contracts for this subvention taking into full account the new regime introduced under EU law, which comprises the new regulations of last October.  They will become mandatory from the end of December 2009.  In addition, the Department will shortly undertake a study of how Dublin Bus organises network planning capacity.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, there is no change in the system that has been operating for the last ten years but there is a commitment to reform the legislative position under the Transport Act 1932 to ensure the provision of a level playing field for all market participants, both public and private, which is not there at present.  Proposals for the new licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislative proposals.  Deputy Kenny thought we were rowing back from what is currently there but we are not doing so.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will amend the Transport Act 1932 in line with the Dublin transport authority Bill.  The Deputy is obviously very happy with what is there at the moment but we are not so happy with it.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should do something about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will do that with the Opposition&rsquo;s wholehearted support.  Therefore the Dublin transport authority Bill will be coming before the House, while the proposed amendment of the 1932 legislation is also under discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is quite prepared to say anything and hopes to get away with it.  He mentioned rowing back and forth but the point is that he has completely abandoned ship.  Whoever wrote that answer for him was very selective in the choice of phrases chosen from the programme for Government.  First, there are approximately 1,100 buses in total in Dublin, not 1,100 new buses.  Second, the Taoiseach is right in saying there is no change &mdash; that is why people must wait two years for a licensing decision.  Third, the most important and fundamental element of the Dublin transport authority was to regulate competition, yet there will be no such competition now.  The ship has been completely abandoned.</P>
        <P>I remind the Taoiseach of what is in his programme for Government.  The author of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply did not say the programme for Government is to &ldquo;deliver real commuting choice&rdquo; and specifically to reform bus licensing to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing pitch for all market participants.  That has been abandoned.  In his announcement on Sunday, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, said we would just have a single provider, with Dublin Bus doing the business from Popintree right around the whole perimeter of the city with a first-class service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not believe everything he reads.  That is his problem.  I did not make any such statement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government has clearly abandoned the element of competition, which has been so good in so many other areas.  Uniquely in the bus service, <Col N="525"/>however, it will be left to one provider alone.  Have we got to a stage where the issue of commuter policy is much more important for the provider than for the consumer?  Why has this change of heart by the Minister, on behalf of the Government, occurred?</P>
        <P>Ten quality bus corridors are currently operating, while another ten are under construction and a further 39 are in the pipeline.  The Minister says the Dublin transport authority will be on stream fairly soon, but the competition element has been abandoned and future legislation will deal with all of this.  Meanwhile, there are three or four weeks left in this session, following which we will have a relatively short period before the summer recess and the Government will be away again.  Has the entire Cabinet given its approval to this change of heart announced by the Minister last Sunday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Three points have been raised and I will try not to confuse what is a simple issue.  The Dublin transport authority Bill will be before the House shortly.  The Bill is almost ready and will deal with a number of important things including responsibility for the allocation of Exchequer funds, which will give the DTA power to ensure the delivery of priority transport projects.  It will have power to contract out services, which will allow for the integration of services and infrastructure, ensuring that bus services are effectively integrated with the metro on its completion.  It will have responsibility to deliver public transport infrastructural projects through existing agencies but, should it consider it more efficient and expeditious to do so, it can deliver a project itself.  It will have power of direction to ensure delivery of integrated ticketing, passenger information and fares.  That Bill is almost ready and will be published shortly.</P>
        <P>As regards Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s second point, both he and I have quoted from the programme for Government, which includes a commitment to improve services under Transport 21 by reforming the bus licensing provisions of the Transport Act 1932.  The Act is over 75 years old and is generally considered not to be suitable.  We stated we would reform that legislation to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants, both public and private.  That is what the Minister stated the other day and he did not state anything else.</P>
        <P>Proposals for that new bus licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislative proposals.  In the meantime, it will be business as usual for all private operators who wish to apply to the Department of Transport for a licence under the 1932 Act until it is amended.  The Minister said it would be open to all market participants, both public and private.  If any private operator can show and prove that it can improve and enhance the services Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann consider they can do in many instances, it will not be ruled out.  Similarly, if the public sector has a view on how it can enhance the service, it should not be automatically ruled out just for the consideration of the private speculative market.  That is not what happens at present, so Dublin Bus should be entitled to put its views forward.  Those matters will be dealt with in the amendment to the 1932 Act.  Up to now, as the Deputy said, people who have a suggestion for a licence are quite liberally dealt with; they can put their case to the Department and seek a licence.  That system is working on many routes and has been extended on many routes over the last few years.  That is all the Minister stated, so I do not see any issue in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Does the Minister have the backing of the Cabinet?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This week <i>The Irish Times </i>published figures it had obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, which show that prisoners have tested positive for drugs in our prisons some 40,000 times over the past three years.  That has occurred in a prison population of 3,200.  We are told that in some prisons 75% of the tests carried out have proved positive.  In 25,000 of the 40,000 cases we are talking about opiates, including heroin.  There is <Col N="526"/>clearly a major drugs problem in our prisons but it is not a new problem from the Government&rsquo;s point of view.</P>
        <P>In 1997, the programme for Government published by the Taoiseach and his colleagues stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We will establish a custodial detention centre for convicted drug addicts and remand prisoners who are addicted, with all other prisons to be drug free.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Having failed to deliver on this commitment, the Taoiseach and his colleagues had another go at it in the programme for Government in 2002, which stated: &ldquo;By the end of 2002, we will publish a plan to completely end all heroin use in Irish prisons.&rdquo;  Having failed for a second time, there was another attempt in the 2007 programme for Government, which gave a commitment to &ldquo;extend measures to make prisons drugs free&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Government, over an 11-year period, has promised to make prisons drugs free but what it has delivered is prisons where drugs are freely available.  By any standards, its drugs-free policy for prisons has been a failure.  Will the Taoiseach explain how so many drugs are getting into prisons in the first place?  If the State cannot keep drugs out of prisons, what hope is there of keeping drugs out of our communities?  If drugs are available in such quantities in what are supposed to be safe places of detention, how on earth will we keep them out of places of entertainment?  How does the Taoiseach respond to a sceptical member of the public who must wonder, given the quantity of drugs in prisons and the numbers of prisoners testing positive for drug use, whether there is not some type of unofficial policy of keeping prisoners drugged and perhaps quietened rather than addressing the use of drugs and access to drugs in prisons?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the figures published yesterday, many of the tests referred to were carried out on prisoners who had just been committed and relate to drug use prior to imprisonment.  That should be highlighted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The prison staff must have been up all night testing prisoners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will explain.  It is only since last October that prison staff have the power to carry out random mandatory drug tests on prisoners.  This was not previously available and drug testing was, therefore, primarily targeted at those prisoners suspected of taking drugs or who had a known history of drug misuse.  The figures should not be taken as an indicator of drug misuse across the wider prison population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure is 75%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures are not representative of all prisoners.</P>
        <P>Some 500 prisoners are on supervised methadone maintenance programmes at any one time.  These prisoners are initially tested at least twice weekly and tend to be tested in any case, even if they have been in prison for some time, at least once a week.  This amounts to some 30,000 tests.  Thus, the figures include the tests that take place on people who are on supervised methadone treatment.</P>
        <P>This is not to say there is no problem.  I do not wish to downplay it.  However, in interpreting the figures, one must allow for these issues.  There is a range of other issues involved in this testing that would not be included.  There is a drug problem in many of the areas from which prisoners come.  It is obvious and inevitable that this will have a knock-on effect in prisons in some cases.  We must deal with that problem.</P><Col N="527"/>
        <P>An elaborate set of security measures has been put in place to deal with the situation.  The drug testing of prisoners began formally last October and it takes place in four circumstances: where requested by the courts in regard to pending proceedings; where prisoners are in drug-free units, institutions or open centres; where prisoners are participating in methadone maintenance programmes; and for management and operational reasons.  These are the four categories under which prisoners are tested.</P>
        <P>The Prison Service policy for keeping drugs out of prisons was launched just under two years ago.  This involved the establishment of an external monitoring group which meets regularly to monitor implementation of that strategy.  It has set out several steps that are required to get to a position where there will be no drugs in prisons, to provide adequate treatment for those addicted to drugs and to ensure that developments in prisons are linked into the community.  This policy involves a multifaceted approach to tackling the problems associated with substance abuse.  There is a particular focus on the need to assist prisoners who indicate a serious desire to tackle their drug problem.  The methadone treatment programme is one such method of assistance.</P>
        <P>Specific developments in the area of drug treatment include the provision of 24 addiction counsellors to cover all prisons, the contract for which was awarded to Merchant&rsquo;s Quay last year.  Additional nurse officers have been allocated to dedicated drug treatment teams in prisons.  A consultant psychiatrist in addiction and registrar of prisons have been appointed to provide counselling sessions and resources have been allocated to improve the quality, co-ordination and availability of drug treatment programmes.  The previous position was that little addiction counselling was available in prisons.  We were working on the basis that we had security and that there were no drugs in prisons.  This was not a sustainable policy given that we all knew there were.  We now have a dedicated staff of addiction counsellors, nurses and consultant psychiatrists to assist prisoners and treat those who are genuinely trying to beat the habit.</P>
        <P>To eliminate the availability of drugs, we have introduced tough security measures.  This is the other side of the issue.  We must take the carrot and stick approach.  Not everybody wants to accept treatment and partake in rehabilitation.  Modern cameras and probe systems are being used to assist in searching for drugs.  Security detectors are being used to search persons entering prisons.  The security in place is the same as that employed at airports and is thus at a very high level.  Previously it involved only random checks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>No matter how one interprets the Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer, we are a long way from the drug-free prisons he promised us 11 years ago, promised for a second time six years ago and then promised us again last year.  It seems the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his Department are not on top of the situation.  For example, my colleague, Deputy Tuffy, asked a question of the Minister earlier this month about the quantity and value of drugs seized in prisons in the last five years.  The Minister replied:</P>
        <P LI="1">An accurate breakdown of statistics as requested by the Deputy is not available without the manual examination of records going back over a considerable time period.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister further stated that such an examination &ldquo;would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time&rdquo;.  In other words, the Department does not know the quantity and value of drugs seized in prisons in the last five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach spoke about everything from nurses and consultant psychiatrists to airport security being introduced in prisons to address the problem.  Will he <Col N="528"/>consider allowing prison officers to arrest a person bringing drugs into prison?  We have an absurd situation where a prison officer cannot arrest a visitor who is discovered bringing in drugs for a prisoner.  Unless garda&iacute; are available or come quickly enough, these people must be released.  I suggest this as a start to tackling the problem of large quantities of drugs being brought into prisons on a regular basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last point, I understand there were industrial relations difficulties which have since been ironed out.  Prison officers are now co-operating with the new security arrangements.  I assume I am referring to the same issue as that raised by the Deputy.  If not, I will check that for him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>

	<P>I mentioned an industrial relations issue that has been ironed out.  I gave the list of the preventative issues that are taking place.  In fairness, 500 of this country&rsquo;s 3,000 prisoners are on methadone treatment.  They are being tested.  One cannot move to any of the open-end prisons without having been tested and found to be drug free.  Substantial moves are being made in that area.</P>
        <P>We also need to focus on the security area, which is the other side of it, as part of the carrot and stick approach.  We are providing for mandatory drug testing and studying trends of drug misuse.  Prisons are using dogs to do searches on a daily basis.  More than 30 people are directly involved in that in our prisons.  Prisons are using security screens like those used in airports to check if people coming in and out are carrying drugs.  Let us be honest, many of those who visit prisoners use imaginative and hard to detect ways of carrying drugs in and out of prisons.  The only way to counteract such behaviour is to use sophisticated technology.  Prisons are taking many other measures in respect of staffing and visitors etc.  We would have said a few years ago that such methods were not needed in prisons.  That is one side of it.  The other side is to try to help prisoners to break the habit by giving them a chance to do so while they are in prison.  They should be able to avail of the advice of those who can assist them, such as addiction counsellors and consultant psychiatrists.  We can use heavy-handed security measures on those who choose not to look for help.  Both of those approaches are in operation.  I am not saying there is no difficulty.  A section of the prison population and a section of those who visit prisoners go to extraordinary lengths to bring drugs into our prisons.</P>

	<P>I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that the members of the Cabinet come to the House for the Order of Business.  When the Taoiseach was first appointed to the Cabinet, it was obligatory for Ministers to come to the House for the Order of Business unless they were on Government business.</P>
        <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach about the comments he made on the Finance Bill on Friday, 8 February last.  On that occasion, he appeared to downgrade the Government&rsquo;s forecast for economic growth to 2.5%.  The Minister for Finance claimed in his budget that our economic growth would be 3% in GDP terms and 2.8% in GNP terms.  In light of the latest EU economic report, can the Taoiseach clarify the Government&rsquo;s forecast for economic growth in 2008 in the context of the Finance Bill that is currently being considered?</P>
        <P>The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Ms Nancy Pelosi, was involved last week in a number of discussions within the Democratic caucus about limited immigration.  I assume the Taoiseach is due to go to the US for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and subsequently to address the US Congress.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to me recently to tell me that the Irish ambassador in Washington is engaged in continuous negotiations with American representatives about the undocumented Irish.  Congressman Shuler has proposed the SAVE Act &mdash; HR 4008 &mdash; to require the mandatory deportation of 11 million people from the US.  Are efforts being made by the Government to build on Speaker Pelosi&rsquo;s high level talks last week and to bring about limited immigration reform, arising from the decision that was made here?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>He has made a lot of progress.  The Minister said that parents could appeal decisions.  No appeals system is in place because a section of the 2004 Act has not been commenced.  Can I get a report from the Taoiseach on when the sections of the Act which have not been commenced will be commenced?  When will the Act be effective?  A total of 150 cases are backed up in the High Court.  I was informed by a parent last week that he has spent &euro;250,000 on furniture replacement and private education for his autistic child.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and he had something interesting to say on the promised civil partnership Bill.  He stated &ldquo;At the end of the day, politically it boils down to six versus 78?&rdquo;. <Col N="532"/> Is there a problem in Government with that Bill?  The Government promised the heads of the Bill would be drafted before March.  With two weeks to go, when are we likely to see them?  Is Deputy Cuffe mistaken about his calculation of the level of support in Government for the legislation?</P>
        <P>I would like to raise the transfer of parliamentary questions by the Taoiseach.  I tabled three questions to him relating to various matters under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and the position of the High Court judge and complaints referee established under the Act who reports to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach transferred the three questions to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  However, on 25 April last, the Taoiseach replied to my predecessor who tabled identical questions to those he transferred.  Why is he not prepared to give me an answer to questions he was quite happy to reply to a number of months ago to my predecessor?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of parliamentary questions is not in order on the Order of Business.  That is the prerequisite of the Taoiseach.  I call the Taoiseach on the civil partnership Bill.</P>

	<P>The civil partnership Bill will provide for a system of registration of same sex partnerships and certain legal protections for them and cohabitants.

There is a signalled delay in the introduction of the social housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which had been promised for early 2008, as the recently published legislative programme states it will be published in mid-2008.  Many families and individuals of senior years for whom there is no provision of social and affordable housing face a serious situation.  In light of that, will the Taoiseach bring forward the Bill to be addressed in the House before Easter?</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am aware that your office has no responsibility for the replies given by Ministers to parliamentary questions but, as Ceann Comhairle, you have a responsibility to protect our rights, and one of the fundamental rights of an Opposition Deputy is to hold the Government to account.  What do we do when the Minister for Education and Science gives answers to questions which, if given in the junior or leaving certificate examinations, would be marked as a massive failure because she avoids or refuses to answer them?</P>

	<P>What redress do we have?  There will be one period of Oral Questions to the Minister for Education and Science this session.  Every other opportunity we have to ask questions is by way of written reply.  I invite the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office to examine the replies.  In many questions with four component parts, one receives a reply to one with the <Col N="533"/>other three being totally disregarded.  What is the Minister trying to hide?  How can we do our job of holding the Government to account?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be well aware the Chair has no responsibility for the replies of a given Minister or the Taoiseach and has no input whatsoever into it.  It is possible, however, for the Deputy to raise this matter on the Adjournment, if he so wishes, and we will try to give it sympathetic consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Will you consider this point?  I accept you have no responsibility for the content of the reply but, surely, you have some responsibility for a refusal to give any reply to a specific question.  There is a distinction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, there is a long-standing precedent that the Chair has no input in the reply a Minister or the Taoiseach gives and cannot make him or her reply to any question.  It is as plain and simple as that but if the Deputy wishes to raise the matter on the Adjournment, he may do so.</P>

Under promised legislation, I remind the Taoiseach that the Cabinet has agreed the heads of the prison development approval (confirmation) Bill, which is necessary for the acquisition of the Thornton Hall lands and complex to facilitate development there.  The legislation is listed for publication in mid-2008.  The heads have been agreed for some time and it is not the most technical or broad-based legislation.  There is a delay and there is no great reason the legislation should not be brought forward as a matter of urgency, having regard to the new prison building consequent on it.</P>
        <P>Rather than blaming prison officers for this issue, which the Taoiseach seemed to do in reply to questions by Deputy Gilmore, he might remind the House of the requirement that at least one member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be present outside each prison and institution of custody on all occasions.</P>

        <P>Government amendments to this effect are proposed in respect of sections 18, 20 and 21.  These amendments are similar to the approach taken in amendment No. 3 and, if adopted, will ensure there is power to prosecute offences involving passports that expired prior to the commencement of the Act.  The Office of Parliamentary Counsel has advised that it would be desirable to locate the amendments in the relevant sections later in the Bill rather than in section 2.  Accordingly, I ask Deputy Lynch to withdraw her amendment and to agree to the Government amendments.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I raised this issue on Second and Committee Stages.  One of the difficulties we witnessed in Chad when children were being exported or transferred to France was that nobody could identify them.  I do not infer that such a situation will arise here but I cannot see why we are not issued with a passport at birth, which is the case for birth certificates.</P>
        <P>Knowingly or otherwise, my intention was misinterpreted by some speakers on Second Stage.  A week-old child can get a passport lasting three or five years.  We would be able to track people and it would help to maintain the electoral register because people could automatically be included on it.  Adoption of my amendment would bring great administrative benefits.  Cattle and even donkeys get passports on birth, yet we will not give them to our children.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill permits a citizen to apply for a passport under section 6(1).  Similarly, section 6(3) permits the making of an application by a parent or guardian on behalf of a child.  Having provided for the right to make an application, section 6(2) requires applications to be made in such form and to be accompanied by such information and documents as may be required.  In other words, a citizen can choose whether to apply for a passport.  If he or she chooses to do so, the application must satisfy a number of mandatory requirements.</P>
        <P>Accepting the proposed amendments could make it mandatory for a citizen or, in the case of a child, the guardian of a citizen to apply for a passport.  Citizens have the right to hold passports but are not and should not be obliged to apply for them.  I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>

	<P>The term &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; could give rise to difficulties.

I will not press the amendment but I foresee that a more enlightened Administration will bring in the measure in time.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 8, line 24, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs on including this provision in the Bill.  The provision is important because it recognises reality in this area, particularly for individuals who find themselves in a position of what the Bill refers to as &ldquo;gender reassignment&rdquo;.  In circumstances where a person has changed gender from male to female or <i>vice versa</i>, the provision confers on the Minister discretion to issue a passport based on the new gender that individual is recognised as possessing.</P>
        <P>This is a welcome provision and it shows the Minister for Foreign Affairs recognises that, to date, Ireland has been in breach on the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of this matter.  The amendment proposes that instead of his having a discretion to recognise the position of what are known as transgendered persons, the Minister will have an obligation to do so.  That is why I propose to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for that of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I hope the amendment will be taken on board.  In my view it is the intention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give to transgendered persons the recognition they are seeking.</P>
        <P>It is hugely anomalous that we will be in a position to issue passports to people who may be described as male, while they may only be able to obtain birth certificates which describe them as female or <i>vice versa</i>.  Mr. Justice McKechnie, in a case involving Dr. Lydia Foy, handed down a judgment some time ago which stated that, in so far as transgendered persons cannot <Col N="539"/>obtain new certificates of a similar nature to those allowed under the Gender Recognition Act in England, our law is in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was invited to indicate that it would address the issue.  The matter arose again in the High Court last week, some time after the delivery of the main judgment in which the formal orders were drawn up.  For the first time a decision was delivered by the Irish courts &mdash; under the legislation which allows them to consider the European Convention on Human Rights &mdash; to the effect that the State is in violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
        <P>I welcome the change the Minister for Foreign Affairs is making.  However, my opinion is that the provision should be obligatory and not discretionary in nature.  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, has seisin of the Bill and I suggest to him that those in Cabinet with responsibility for the birth registration laws should ensure that we have compatible legislation in that area.  This would allow transgendered persons to obtain new certificates detailing their gender, thereby allowing them to secure identity documents and birth certificates reflecting their new sexual identities.  Under the Gender Recognition Act in Britain, this does not affect the original birth certificate or a marriage certificate.  However, it allows the state, in its records, to recognise the new reality in respect of individuals living within its borders and it allows them to obtain documentation which reflects that reality.</P>
        <P>The Passport Bill is welcome because it reflects the reality to which I refer.  However, it will cast a stark light on the peculiar circumstances in which people will themselves be described on their passports as female and in the only certificates they can obtain relating to their births as male, or <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State take on board the amendment?  In my opinion, it is the intention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to implement the legislation in the way I have outlined.  His doing so will give solace to the small number of people in the transgender community.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State ask the Minister to draw to the attention of Cabinet members that we will have a major anomaly whereby our passport legislation will recognise reality but where our birth registration laws will be blind to it?  This issue was addressed by the introduction of specific legislation in the United Kingdom.  In his judgment, Mr. Justice McKechnie invited the Government to bring the State into line with the European convention by introducing similar legislation.  The Government has not given priority to introducing such legislation.  In the context of the court decision and the Bill before us, we should bring all legislation in this country into alignment with the convention in order to reflect the factual reality of the gender of those who seek services and certification from the State which, for different reasons, they will need as they go through life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Where an applicant meets the requirements set out in the legislation in respect of identity and citizenship, the Minister will issue a passport.  However, the Bill does not make issuing a passport a mandatory requirement.  If the amendment were accepted, section 11 would be the only circumstance in which the Bill obliged the Minister to issue a passport.  In the interest of ensuring consistency with other sections, it is preferable that the existing wording be retained.  I assure the Deputy that when the requirements of section 11 are met, the Minister will issue a passport in the new name and sex of the applicant.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State respond in respect of the anomaly I mentioned but to which his script may not contain reference?  It is anomalous that the Department of Foreign Affairs would recognise someone as being of female gender, while the Department of Health and Children or the HSE may insist that said person is a male.  That is quite an odd position for the State to occupy, particularly in light of the High Court judgment handed down <Col N="540"/>before Christmas.  As already stated, this matter was again dealt with by the courts last week.  In those proceedings, the State was represented by the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State shed some light on what, if any, action the State intends to take in respect of this issue?  Is the State going to appeal the High Court decision to the Supreme Court?  I hope it will not because if it does, it is unlikely to succeed.  If it did succeed, the matter would end up before the European Court of Human Rights.  They would come to their own conclusion, which I believe would be in line with Mr. Justice McKechnie&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>I welcome what is in the Passports Bill and accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation for not amending it.  It is anomalous that two different Departments might regard the same individual as having a different gender.  This goes back in our courts to 2002, when this litigation first came to prominence.  I suggest to the Minister of State that the time has come to rectify the matter.  What is being done in the Passports Bill is praiseworthy but it highlights the anomaly.  It is not unreasonable that the Minister of State should respond to that, even if he does not have a departmental note on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I can discuss the matter with other Ministers who would deal more directly with the matter.  We are dealing with the administration of the passport system.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not recognise that people would be referred to as having a different gender, depending on the document.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 9, to delete line 8.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 relate to the circumstances under which the Minister can refuse to issue a passport.  We dealt with the matter at some length on Committee Stage and I hoped the Minister would return with some amendments to the section.</P>
        <P>There are various circumstances under which the Minister can refuse to issue a passport, with the first being blindingly obvious.  If the Minister is not satisfied a person is an Irish citizen, a passport will not issue.  That is obvious and there is no difficulty with it.  If the Minister is not satisfied about a person&rsquo;s identity, a passport will not issue either, which is common sense.</P>
        <P>Under section 12(1)(<i>c</i>), a provision indicates the Minister may not issue a passport if &ldquo;the person would be likely in the opinion of the Minister, after consultation, where appropriate, with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Minister for Defence or both, to engage in&rdquo; various types of conduct.</P>
        <P>The first type of conduct which can result in a refusal to grant a passport is if that person &ldquo;might prejudice national security or the security of another state&rdquo;.  If we believed somebody in Ireland to be a terrorist looking for a passport, and we had sound evidence to suggest that if that person went to another state he or she might blow him or herself up with other people, blow up other people or shoot others, it is reasonable that the State would not issue a passport.</P>
        <P>Another provision is if we believe a person &ldquo;might endanger public safety or order,&rdquo; a passport will not be issued.  That is reasonable in circumstances where if a passport is not issued, there is an appeals system.  That was originally absent from the Bill but we have that because of matters raised on Second Stage.  It is an imperfect system and I will come back to it.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about two other provisions in section 12(1)(<i>c</i>).  We can refuse a passport if we believe it &ldquo;would be contrary to the common good&rdquo;.  I assume this refers to a person being given a passport.  I propose we delete the words &ldquo;would be contrary to the common good&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister of State to give examples of what is meant by that phrase.  Will he provide three or four examples of the circumstances in which a passport would be witheld on the basis of a belief it would be contrary to the common good to issue one?  It seems to be an extraordinarily wide phrase.</P>
        <P>It is reminiscent of the approach taken by the old Soviet Union and still taken in China.  If people go abroad and are critical of the state or government there, it would be perceived as being contrary to the common good in those countries.  A variety of other countries have a similar view of the world.  The Iranians are not too enthusiastic in allowing people go abroad who might be critical of Iran and Syrians do not greet that sort of conduct with great enthusiasm.  In Myanmar they do not want people either at home or abroad to be critical.</P>
        <P>There is a variety of totalitarian countries that curtail the freedoms of their citizens within their borders and the freedom of citizens to leave the state on the basis that if they leave, those people may make a statement critical of the state, contrary to the common good.  I do not know <Col N="542"/>the function of that provision in passport legislation enacted in this republic and I would like the Minister of State to spell out the specific circumstances envisaged.</P>
        <P>The first two provisions I referred to were the possibility that a person might prejudice national security or the security of another state or endanger public safety or order, be it in this State or another.  I presume the reference to this State might pertain to people going abroad to collect armaments to bring to this State.  These provisions appear to cover the broad range of eventualities about which we need express concern.</P>
        <P>In five or ten years we may have a Government that is a bit prickly and does not like to be criticised.  We could assume representatives of an NGO are going to an international conference to explain why there is so much child poverty in Ireland, or who have a view about whether we are protecting people&rsquo;s civil rights in particular areas.  They may want to go to an international conference relating to the education of autistic children.  Deputy Hanafin may be the Minister for Justice, and as she seems incapable of taking criticism on that issue or even constructively responding to it, she may decide it would be contrary to the common good if a person spoke at the conference expressing criticism of the Government of the day.</P>
        <P>This particular provision smacks of a danger that could control people&rsquo;s democratic rights outside Ireland to engage in issues that may make the Government uncomfortable.  They may not be issues posing a threat to people&rsquo;s safety or national security but they may cause general discomfort.</P>
        <P>We could presume a pop band performs songs we do not approve of.  If members of the band sought passports for a tour around the United States, it may be decided that if the songs are performed there, the country may be deprived of a few extra tourists.  The passports may not be issued.</P>

	<P>We could have an exception for Dustin the turkey.  Other than that, I cannot see what function this provision has and I suggest it be deleted.  There is another oddity in this Bill which I would like the Minister of State to explain.  I may have some sympathy with the point but it is wrong-headed.  Under section 12(1)(<i>c</i>)(iv) if a person is likely to endanger himself or herself or others a passport can be withheld.  Subsection (ii) covers a person who might endanger others and I have no difficulty with the idea of refusing that person a passport.  What does the concept of people not endangering themselves mean?  Do we withhold passports from a group of climbers who want to climb Mount Everest because someone thinks that is unwise as they might endanger themselves, from someone who wants to run in the New York marathon who we believe is not fit enough to do so, from NGO organisations working in dangerous parts of the world such as Darfur or from individuals who want to engage in other <Col N="543"/>forms of conduct outside Ireland which we all know to be unsafe but which might be beneficial?  Human beings are entitled to make choices and I am not sure what benefit there is in that provision.  </P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs may wish to stop the sort of conduct we witnessed in the past couple of weeks when an individual, for political reasons, defied the view of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and of Foreign Affairs by, apparently illegally, entering Gaza but the Egyptians would not allow the person to return.  What people do illegally, what they say, the parts of the world they seek to enter, and the people with whom they engage often gives us more insight into what they believe when they pronounce on other occasions.  If someone chooses to go to Gaza, good luck to him or her.  Does the Minister for Foreign Affairs intend not to issue a passport to, or remove one from, someone of that sort, bearing in mind that the same criteria apply in both cases?  The person might then be permanently, indefinitely or for a specific period deprived of his or her right to travel.</P>
        <P>These are important issues and concern not only the issuing of passports but also their removal.  If I go abroad and say something that discomfits the Minister will someone in the immigration office in Dublin Airport take my passport from me?  Do we want to empower a future Government to do that?  Let us assume that there is a Minister for Foreign Affairs or a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is somewhat hotheaded, does not think matters through clearly, shoots from the hip&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and is publicity-obsessed, and that someone says something abroad that he does not like.  It is not so long since there was someone like that in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  People can form their own views on that point.  Under this provision, that Minister would have a role in the removal of an individual&rsquo;s passport.  Let us assume the Minister heard at 11 p.m. that someone was flying into Dublin Airport who had said something distressing to him at 8 p.m. that evening, in another country &mdash; could he use this provision to call some forlorn immigration officer in the airport to demand that he or she remove the person&rsquo;s passport?  Could a Minister do this so that he might just get a headline in the newspapers the following morning because, God forbid, he might not otherwise be mentioned that day?  It is not so long since there was someone in this House who fitted that category.  This is a dangerous provision because it allows not only the refusal, but also the removal, of passports.  Will the Minister of State spell out the circumstances in which it is envisaged these two provisions will be used?  I formally propose my amendments to the Bill. </P>

        <P>It is necessary to spell out the basis on which passports could be removed.  I understood that we had the right to remove passports in cases of criminal proceedings such that the passport of someone released on bail had to be surrendered.  Maybe the criminal justice legislation covers that.  What does the Minister of State regard as grounds for removing a passport from someone who is not in that category?  I do not want the Minister of State to recite a litany of criminal offences in respect of which a passport could be removed.  What lists are there of potential embarrassment abroad and under what circumstances could the Minister remove a passport, apart from the criminal offences of which we are conscious?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of amendment No. 14, it is very unlikely that in practice the Minister would seek to invoke the power to refuse a passport on the basis of the common good.  Its inclusion is intended to provide discretion in exceptional cases.  It is also included in recognition of the fact that the High Court explicitly cited the common good in the judgment that first identified the unenumerated constitutional right to travel as a limitation on that right.  </P>
        <P>The power to refuse a passport on the basis of the common good is not unlimited and is subject to several restrictions.  The concept is defined and clarified further by reference to the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, in particular Protocol 4 to that convention.  The Minister is also obliged by the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 to perform his functions in accordance with the State&rsquo;s obligations under the convention and its protocols.  Among other implications this means that the restriction must in each case be proportionate and necessary in a democratic society.  Furthermore, refusal to issue a passport including a refusal on the basis of the common good may be appealed to the passport appeals officer and is also subject to judicial review.  There is value in retaining scope for discretion under the Bill and I am opposed to the amendment seeking its deletion.</P>
        <P>In respect of amendment No. 15, it is important to retain scope to refuse a passport to a person likely to engage in conduct that might endanger him or herself.  My Department has been involved in a few tragic consular cases involving citizens who inadvertently placed their health or lives at risk by travelling abroad.  As with other grounds to refuse, this power would rarely be exercised and would have to be exercised in compliance with the Minister&rsquo;s obligations under the ECHR, as well as being subject to appeal and judicial review.  In such cases the Minister will normally be in receipt of information provided by family members and or medical practitioners.  Furthermore, as the Bill provides, when a passport application is refused the Minister will always provide reasons in writing to an individual.  In cases of this nature the practice will also be to outline the circumstances in which a passport could be granted.   This might, for example, involve the applicant supplying written confirmation from a medical practitioner that he or she is fit to travel.  As removing the Minister&rsquo;s discretion would remove any capacity on the part of the Minister to satisfy the health and welfare of vulnerable citizens, I oppose the amendment.</P>
        <P>In respect of amendment No. 17 tabled by Deputy Michael D. Higgins, section 18(6) provides that &ldquo;an applicant for a passport shall, if ... required by the Minister, surrender a passport issued to him or her (whether or not it is valid) before another passport may be issued to him or her&rdquo;.  Section 6(2)(<i>b</i>) provides that an application shall be &ldquo;accompanied by such information and documents in relation to the person as the Minister may require under section 7&rdquo;.  The Minister is thus entitled to require an applicant to submit a previous passport as part of an application for a new passport.  Furthermore, the Minister may refuse, under section 12(2), to issue a passport if an application does not comply with section 6.</P><Col N="545"/>
        <P>Consequently, while I appreciate the constructive intentions underlying amendment No. 17, there are other provisions in the Bill that permit refusal when an applicant refuses to surrender a previous passport and I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It now appears that when the House debates Bills on Report Stage, Ministers cannot go off script to respond to questions asked of them.  I asked the Minister of State a simple question, namely, whether he could provide four examples of circumstances in which in the common good it might be justified to either not grant a passport or withhold someone&rsquo;s passport.  He told me the Government wishes to retain the provision because it wants discretion in this regard but has not given me a single reason.</P>
        <P>His comments on the second issue he has raised were interesting.  The Minister of State wishes to be able to withhold or remove passports from people in circumstances in which, in the context of the wording, they might be endangered or might endanger themselves.  Is he trying to prevent people in Ireland who may be intent on travelling to another country that permits euthanasia, such as Holland, from leaving Ireland?  Is that what this is about?  Alternatively, does the Minister intend to create some form of health service in Dublin Airport to carry out cardiac and thrombosis tests on all those over 65 who climb on aeroplanes?  Such a health service in Dublin Airport would be better than that which obtains within the general health service.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that passports would be refused or withheld in circumstances indicated by someone&rsquo;s health. Does this refer to mental, or to physical health?  If the former, procedures exist to have people compulsorily admitted to hospital who are psychiatrically unable to take care of themselves.  This is a medical, rather than a passport issue.  If this pertains to physical health, does that mean that any elderly people who are looking a bit grey on the day they fly may have their passports removed from them? How will this work?  This is a Parliament and Members are entitled to ask for concrete examples of the circumstances to which this might apply.  Moreover, the Minister of State should clarify whether it will apply in the circumstances I have just described.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Although I did not receive a response to my first contribution, I will refer briefly to Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s amendment.  This point is also related to Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s amendment.  It is unlikely that a better health service will be provided in Dublin Airport than in our hospitals, which is unfortunate.  Moreover, it is unlikely that the powers in this Bill will ever be invoked because neither the wit nor the will exists, unless it was for some political purpose, to so do.  I refer to the third amendment with which the Minister of State dealt and which he also is not prepared to accept.  It is quite likely that a proportion of our citizens would sell their passports on the black market.  However, such people can return, re-apply for and receive another passport.  I do not accept that the Minister may ask for the original document <Col N="546"/>to be presented because I have two old passports at home.  Admittedly the covers are cut in such a fashion as to ensure they cannot be used again but nevertheless, I have never been asked to produce those documents nor have I been asked to produce something that I could have sold in the past, as some people do.  Irish passports are highly valuable travel documents and this amendment would put the issue beyond doubt.  I do not understand the reason the Minister of State will not accept it.  While I accept there are other provisions in the Bill, it is unlikely, like Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s proposition, that this will ever come to pass and the legislation should put it beyond doubt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I mentioned earlier to Deputy Shatter that my Department has been involved in a small number of tragic consular cases in which citizens inadvertently placed their health or their lives at risk in travelling abroad.  I refer to people in receipt of psychiatric treatment who travel overseas with the resultant discontinuation of their treatment.  That constitutes an example.  However, I repeat my point that there is a question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a bad example.  If such people already are overseas, the Department will not withdraw their passports to prevent them from coming home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>We have the passport appeals office and people can also avail of judicial review.  I made this point earlier.</P>
        <P>I take Deputy Lynch&rsquo;s point that people retain a number of passports.  However, in addition to my earlier remarks, I should add that section 18 provides for circumstances in which a passport must be surrendered to the Minister or to the Garda.  This is backed up by offences under section 20 regarding failure to surrender a passport when so required.  This should provide sufficient deterrent to a refusal to surrender a passport.  This is the reason I will not accept amendment No. 17.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I will press amendment No. 14 on the basis that the Minister of State has been incapable of giving Members a single instance to which it is applicable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has the right to make a further contribution if he wishes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do so briefly.  While I understand the time available is open-ended, I will not do that to other Members.</P>
        <P>This is a serious issue.  It is highly disappointing that the Minister of State is unable to provide Members with a single example of what he is talking about.  In the context of someone who might endanger himself or herself, he has told us that the consular service has had some involvement on occasion with Irish citizens abroad who are psychiatrically unwell.  Sadly, that always will be the case.  He has not suggested how that would have been detected by anyone in Dublin Airport before such people departed.  He has not suggested what relevance any of that has to the issuing of passports.</P>
        <P>Does he suggest that if the Irish consul in Cyprus were to discover that a person on holidays there was in need of mental health services, to make life easy, one simply would withdraw the person&rsquo;s passport and keep him or her in Cyprus?  Alternatively, is he suggesting that when such people return to Ireland, one will take their passports from them instead of getting psychiatric help for them?  The Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation makes absolutely no sense and he has not dealt with the issue I raised.</P>
        <P>Some people are genuinely concerned in respect of a form of euthanasia now available in Holland of which some Irish citizens have availed.  Is this an issue that could result in the <Col N="547"/>Minister&rsquo;s intervention?  Is this an issue that would result in the withdrawal of someone&rsquo;s passport because it might endanger that person?</P>
        <P>I will suggest another scenario to the Minister of State.  Court cases have arisen from the so-called pro-life amendment, some of which were taken by organisations and individuals.  Some have related to young teenagers who had become pregnant, were in care and in circumstances in which they were seeking a termination abroad and had a right to travel.  Will this provision be invoked or will some of the aforementioned organisations and groups invoke this provision on the theory that pregnant teenagers or pregnant adult Irish women going abroad to terminate a pregnancy should be deprived of a passport because using a passport might result in them endangering themselves?  Is the Minister of State opening up a hornets&rsquo; nest in a manner that is not understood in the Department of Foreign Affairs?  If the Minister of State tells me the Minister, rather than third parties, will have this power, he should realise that some of the groups that have engaged in litigation will not think twice about taking proceedings against him to require him to remove someone&rsquo;s passport.  Is the impact of this unnecessary and careless wording understood?  The legislation is opening up issues.  That the Minister of State has not been able to cite a single example of the circumstances to which subsections (3) or (4) will apply indicates that the measure has not been thought through properly.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned that the State could refuse the right to travel if it were in the common good.  This judgment was first delivered many years ago by Mr. Justice Finlay when he was President of the High Court.  I need to make a declaration of interest in that I was representing an unmarried mother who was seeking a passport for her child.  It was decided there was a right to travel and it was the first case in which the constitutional right to travel was declared.  Wisely, Mr. Justice Finlay did not declare it an absolute right but one that could be constrained in circumstances related to the common good.  From my recollection of the judgment, I believe the common good he had in mind was when national security, the security of another state, public safety or the safety of the person or life of others is endangered.  He used the phrase &ldquo;common good&rdquo; as a generic phrase to cover the circumstances the Minister of State is now spelling out.  It was not used as some additional overall discretion to lob in for the hell of it.  The Minister of State cannot identify one single instance to which it will apply in refusing or recalling a passport.  The provision therefore has no business being in the legislation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 16:</P><Col N="548"/>
        <P LI="1">In page 9, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&rdquo;(<i>g</i>) the Minister has been notified by the Courts Services that an order has been made to require the surrender of any child&rsquo;s passport or to require any person to refrain from applying for a passport for any child so long as the order is in force.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments are designed to ensure that, where the courts have made an order that requires the surrender of a child&rsquo;s passport or requires any person to refrain from applying for one for any child, the Minister will comply therewith on notification.  The Act does not deal with this problem adequately and it arises frequently in practice in family disputes over children when marriages and extra-marital relationships break down and when it is questioned whether one parent should take a child abroad.</P>
        <P>Some aspects of this issue are dealt with in the legislation, but not adequately.  My amendment is a constructive one to ensure that they will be dealt with properly.  Amendments Nos. 16 and 21 deal with the same issue and relate to different parts of the Bill.  Amendment No. 24 seeks to insert, &ldquo;The Minister is notified by the Courts Services that an order has been made that a passport issued to a child should be cancelled for the purpose of securing the welfare of the child,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Over the years, it has been my experience that, in cases of very fraught relationships involving children who are resident with one parent and not the other, all too frequently it is necessary for the courts to make emergency orders, either to stop a parent taking a child abroad, be it permanently or on vacation, without the consent of the other parent, or to stop a parent obtaining a passport when permission has not been granted by the courts.  It is very important that the legislation reflect what happens in the family law courts.  These amendments are intended to facilitate that and I hope the Minister can take them on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Higgins&rsquo; amendments, Nos. 20 and 22, deal with this issue also, probably in a more detailed way.  However, I support those of Deputy Shatter.  Disputes of the kind in question are rare but, when they occur, they can be quite traumatic.  According to the most recent estimate I saw, unless one has approximately &euro;10,000 to engage quickly in court proceedings to decide on an order &mdash; they are not always granted &mdash; concerning whether a child can be taken out of the country, one is better off proceeding on foot of legislation such as that proposed.  The process would be much less expensive and more orderly and one would not be subject to the type of trauma usually associated with a last-minute dash to the courts.  Since it is so expensive to go to court, one never sees a lone parent doing so.  They simply have not the finance to afford expensive legal advice.  It is better to make provision in this regard in the legislation, such that all parties could benefit therefrom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty with the intention behind these amendments, which are designed to ensure the welfare of children.  Securing the welfare of children is central to this Bill and there are many provisions that touch on the matter.  In the administration of the passport service, the Minister in the normal way is required to and will comply with orders issued by the courts directing him or her to carry out or refrain from certain actions.  This means it is not necessary to make provision for amendment No. 21, which concerns court issuing directions to the Minister.  Amendment No. 16, proposed by Deputy Shatter may assist in ensuring greater clarity on orders directing parents or guardians to refrain from applying for a passport for a child and I therefore propose to accept it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On amendment No. 24, I am assured by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel that there is sufficient cover for the scenario outlined in existing sections of the Bill.  Section 18(1)(<i>a</i>) <Col N="549"/>permits a cancellation where the Minister becomes aware of a fact or circumstance, whether occurring before or after the issuing of passport, that would have permitted a refusal.  Section 18(1)(<i>d</i>) further provides explicit authority to cancel a child&rsquo;s passport where it is necessary to secure the welfare of the child, following the issuing of a passport without the consent of one or more guardians in the exceptional cases set out in sections 14(5) and 14(6).  Accordingly, I propose to accept amendment No. 16 and to oppose amendments Nos. 21 and 24.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s acceptance of amendment No. 16.  Amendments Nos. 21 and 24 set out the position explicitly in a readily understandable manner rather than trying to apply different provisions of the Bill in the circumstances in question.  The advantage of that, in the context of the types of court cases I have in mind, is that it would provide a simple and direct provision for the Courts Service and the judges hearing them to know how this matter would be dealt with and the Minister&rsquo;s approach.  I appreciate that the Minister would generally comply with court orders, but as we are enacting passport legislation, we need to comprehensively deal with these issues.  </P>
      
        <P>The other two amendments would provide greater certainty and more comprehensive cover in this area than is already provided in the Bill.  I appreciate that the Minister of State accepts amendment No. 16.

        <P LI="1">In page 9, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(4) A refusal by the Minister to issue a passport under this section may be appealed to the District Court.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Gabhaim leithsc&eacute;al mar nach raibh m&eacute; anseo n&iacute;os luaithe nuair a moladh na leasuithe.</P>
        <P>The rationale for this provision is similar to that for the group of amendments dealt with prior to the last group of amendments.  The Bill gives huge discretionary powers to the Minister and in the context of this section, it is the power to refuse to issue a passport.  The Minister has the power to cancel or take back a passport under an earlier section but under this section he or she has the power to refuse to issue a passport in the first instance.  The constitutionality of this provision is open to question, given that an individual is either a citizen or not a citizen of the State and a citizen should be entitled to a passport.  If restrictions are to be placed on the use of the passport issued, well and good, but an individual as a citizen should be entitled to a passport.</P><Col N="550"/>
        <P Just="Left">I argued this point at length on Committee Stage.  What right has a Minister, on the basis of his or her opinion or that of his or her Government colleagues, to deny an Irish citizen a passport and, therefore to deny that citizen the right to leave this State?  Other states can refuse to allow an Irish citizen into their jurisdictions in the same way that we can refuse to allow into this jurisdiction an individual who presents himself or herself and who is considered to pose a danger or a threat.  However, in this instance, we are denying somebody the right to leave this State and confining him or her to this State.  States other than member states of the European Union require a person to have a passport to travel to them and even within the European Union, a person is required to have a national ID.  As citizens here do not have a national ID, a passport is the document that establishes their credentials, although a driver&rsquo;s licence is accepted in some instances.</P>
        <P>Under this section, the Minister is depriving an individual of a fundamental liberty.  The Minister outlined on Committee Stage that power could be exercised in circumstances where there was a danger to public safety or the issuing of a passport would be contrary to the common good, but I have not heard of an instance that would stand up to a refusal to issue a passport being the right course of action.  There are other courses of action that can be taken, other than refusing a passport in the first instance, if a person is considered a threat to the common good or to public safety.</P>
        <P>The provisions of this Bill in assigning these powers to the Minister and to a passport appeals officer, a point to which I will return, to cancel or to refuse to issue a passport constitute a judicial function.  Does this provision amount to the Minister exercising a judicial function?  In the way it is worded, I believe it does.  The Minister of State should re-examine this section and perhaps the Minister should be required to apply to the courts to refuse the issuing of a passport, if he or she wishes to go down that route.</P>
        <P>The amendments I tabled are direct in stating a person refused a passport has the right to appeal that decision to the District Court.  While the Minister of State might say that one can appeal any matter to the District Court or to the other courts, if he is adamant that this is the way to proceed, at least this amendment will ensure it is explicit that a person so refused a passport has the right to appeal that decision to the court.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I read into the record on Committee Stage points of law that are relevant in this regard.  Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Flaherty, in the Keady <i>versus</i> Garda Commissioner in 1992, held that in the exercise of judicial powers, an exercise is judicial in its nature if there is contest between the parties &mdash; there would be if the Minister refused to issue a passport &mdash; that can result in the infliction of a punishment or liability &mdash; supplementary criteria were stipulated in another case &mdash; and that the function is of far-reaching effect and importance.  In terms of all those points the provisions in this regard are repugnant to the Article 37 of the Constitution and contrary to that judgment made in 1992.  There is a contest in this instance, a liability can be imposed because the applicant is denied his or her liberty to travel outside this State and the decision has a far-reaching effect and importance.  I urge the Minister of State to re-examine this section.  That is the basis of amendment No. 18. Amendment No. 25 is related and it provides for the inclusion of a reference that a cancellation of a passport can be  appealed to the District Court.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 32 is the final amendment in this grouping.  In regard to the section dealing with appeals, we argued on Committee Stage as to point or purpose of a passport appeals officer structure being set up, when such an officer will have no power.  It will represent merely the establishment of another quango.  All a passport appeals officer will be able to do is confirm the decision of a Minister or recommend that it be set aside, but such an appeals officer will not have the power to set it aside.  Therefore, such a decision will be referred back to the <Col N="551"/>Minister who in the first instance refused to issue the passport.  That section should be removed and it should be implicit that appeals should be referred to the court, or otherwise the appeals officer should be given the power to set aside the Minister&rsquo;s decision in such circumstances.  That is the effect of my amendment No. 32.</P>
        <P>These are reasonable amendments.  I doubt the Minister will take them on board because Ministers tend to want to have all these powers and to face the challenge of having to defend themselves in the Supreme Court at a future day.  That would be the effect of this provision.  I asked on Committee Stage how many passport applications had been refused to Irish citizens.  The Minister of State said it was very few as this was not a power Ministers have exercised.  I do not believe it is a power they should have over Irish citizens.  This whole section needs to be looked at again and the powers being bestowed on the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins was very clear on this.  Virtually everything can be appealed in this country and we are very lucky in that regard.  If one is not granted a taxi licence or a PSV permit, one can appeal to the District Court and if needs be proceed to the Circuit Court.  Whatever a citizen is denied, he or she may appeal, and that is as it should be.  An appeals mechanism should ultimately be concerned with an independent person looking at the circumstances.  That is what we have in the planning process, under criminal law and to a great extent under common law.  However, there is no appeals mechanism for passports, the one thing that ensures Irish citizens travel freely around the world. </P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister of State to the effect that Ministers interfere very little in the whole process.  However, when they do, there should be some mechanism to which an aggrieved person may appeal, even if it is only the courts, to put his or her case.  That is important, because no matter what the circumstances, mistakes can be made.  We could reel off mistakes of a fairly substantial nature that have been made in this House.  This is not something to be sneezed at.  How might one feel if refused a passport and then told there was nowhere to go to appeal this decision?  Where does one go, especially if one feels wronged and aggrieved?  It must be quite devastating when that happens to someone.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said that very few people have ever been refused a passport.  Why not put it into the legislation, then?  If it is so rare, there must be very good reasons when people are refused and I am sure any independent body would uphold the Minister&rsquo;s decision in such cases, so why not put it in? We have very sensible people adjudicating every day of the week on far weightier issues than this.  I appeal to the Minister of State to rethink his position on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill establishes a statutory right in case of refusal or cancellation of passport for such decisions to be appealed to an independent passport appeals officer.  The appeals mechanism is set out in some detail in section 19.  Further supplementary and ancillary details will be set out in regulations that will be laid before the House.  The independent passport appeals officer mechanism provides access to a speedy and inexpensive additional means to challenge the Minister&rsquo;s decision.  If unhappy with the decision of the passport appeals officer, the aggrieved person may seek further recourse through judicial review. </P>
        <P>In answer to Deputies Lynch and &Oacute; Snodaigh, I understand that in the past three years one person was refused a passport.  As I have said, it is a small number.  Amendments Nos. 18 and 25 would make sense if there were no independent appeals mechanism.  However, in view of the provision of an appeal under section 19, I do not believe it is necessary to provide for a supplementary right of appeal to the District Court.  As regards amendments Nos. 27 and 28, proposed by Deputy Michael D. Higgins, citizenship matters are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Foreign Affairs does not have competence to take decisions in that area.  In line with existing practice, a person whose pass<Col N="552"/>port is refused or cancelled on the basis of citizenship, may raise the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Irish nationality and citizenship Acts already establish formal procedures that allow a person claiming to be a citizen to apply to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a certificate of nationality.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 32, proposed by Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, it is not necessary to provide for a further right of appeal to the District Court against the recommendation of the appeals officer.  In the event that an appellant is unhappy, following consideration of the matter by the passport appeals officer, he or she can seek judicial review of the Minister&rsquo;s decision.  I therefore oppose the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the last point, the reason amendment No. 32 seeks that a decision of a passport appeals officer may be appealed is that this official basically has no powers.  I have already said what the Bill contains.  This section was not in the original draft, as far as I can recall, and the only reason it is there now is that the human rights commission said a passport could not be refused unless there was recourse to some type of appeals mechanism.  The appeals mechanism was to be welcomed, bar the fact that all it can do is confirm the Minister&rsquo;s decision rather than set the Minister&rsquo;s decision aside.  An appeals officer should be able to make decisions.  However, he or she cannot make decisions or implement them.  That is the reasoning behind amendment No. 32.  I have already dealt with the other amendments in some detail.  Looking at this whole section, it is very strange that an Irish citizen can be refused a passport.  Section 6 virtually guarantees the right of an Irish citizen to a passport, yet in section 12 this right is taken away, which is procedurally rather odd in the same Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, the motions I was speaking to were about citizenship and the fact that there is no clear cut appeal, in that regard.  I did not quite understand what the Minister of State had to say as regards the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Is he saying an appeal could be made to that Department? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy is talking about citizenship, one would go to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I suppose the issues being discussed are all inter-related in the context of revocation of passports and the decisions made.  Is it the Minister of State&rsquo;s view that when this legislation is enacted, there will be statutory powers to revoke passports of individuals with regard to behaviour of such individuals prior to its enactment?  The exercise of issuing passports is regarded as one of the sovereign powers of a country.  In this context I should like the Minister to clarify that. </P>
        <P>I share some of the concerns expressed about circumstances where an appeals officer can make a recommendation that the Minister is not bound by, and perhaps we can come back to that a little later.  There are certain individuals who might want to be considered for passport removal.  For example, one or two friends of Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, who became known as the &ldquo;Colombia three&rdquo;, went off to engage with FARC guerillas and mysteriously reappeared in this country, without ever fully having explained what they were doing there.  I wonder whether they are candidates for passport revocation.  Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Lynch, the passport appeals office is the speedy and inexpensive means of making a challenge to the Minister&rsquo;s decision.  In reply to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, I will give the same answer, the appeals office is the inexpensive route to take rather than going to court.  In reply to Deputy Shatter, only one person has been refused in the past <Col N="553"/>three years, according to statistics supplied by my officials.  I do not see we would be dealing with the Colombia three either&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the revocation issue.  Would they have their passports revoked?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>

	<P>How stands the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will press the amendment.  I agree the appeals office is an inexpensive way of proceeding.  As there was only one refusal, a passport appeals officer might have absolutely nothing to do and it might not prove to be an inexpensive option.  I agree people have the right to a judicial review but the idea is not to jam up the courts in the first instance.  The easiest way of dealing with it is that the person selected as a passport appeals officer has the power to set aside the decision of the Minister.  At least then, the passport appeals office would have some teeth and some function.  The way it is set out at the moment, it is a hearing which can do nothing other than confirm the Minister&rsquo;s decision.  The second part is that it can refer the decision back to the Minister with a recommendation but no guarantee of outcome, especially considering it would then be up to the Minister to admit a mistake had been made.  I wonder how many Ministers are willing to admit to such a mistake.  I cannot see that office working.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All I have been trying to do in this amendment is ensure that rather than forcing people to opt for a judicial review, they can have a proper hearing at District Court level rather than clog up the High Court or a higher court.  The issues can be teased out properly and the Minister can defend himself or herself.  The reason behind the refusal to issue a passport to an Irish citizen is what is at issue so I will press the amendment.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 19 arises out of committee and was to be taken with Amendment No. 1 which was not moved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 9, line 39, to delete &ldquo;, including biometric data,&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;, including data comprising of information relating to facial structure,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Molaim an leas&uacute; seo.  An f&aacute;th at&aacute; leis an leas&uacute; n&aacute; go bhfuil an iomarca cumhachta&iacute; ag an Aire sa ch&aacute;s seo.</P>
        <P>I apologise for not being present earlier; it took longer than I anticipated to walk from Harcourt Road.  This amendment deals with the biometric data and the powers of the Minister to change what is currently on a passport and the security and protection of that data.  I dealt with this in detail on Committee Stage.  I noted the insecure nature of this data and how it might be broken down.</P>
        <P>Biometric data consists of fingerprints, retinal patterns, facial structures, iris imaging as well as voice and hand geometry, signature, ear and DNA.</P>
        <P>This Bill empowers the Minister at any stage in the future to change the biometric data which is required for passports without recourse to this House.  My amendment seeks to limit the data to that which is already contained in passports and that if the Minister wishes to add or subtract in the future, he or she must come back to the House with an amendment to the <Col N="554"/>Passports Act, as it would be.  Given the change in data protection, the encryption that can be allowed, the security of the data retained and the international circumstances whereby most countries are using this method and refuse to admit Irish passport-holders, at that stage, the Minister should come back to the House and inform the House of his or her intention to include data such as fingerprints, retinal scan or whatever.  This House could then debate whether such a change would be proportional.  If somebody steals one&rsquo;s biometric data, it is the same as stealing one&rsquo;s identity and it is very difficult to retrieve it.  I refer to the significant issues of data protection and data security.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The human rights commission raised concerns about this and referred the Minister to points it had made previously about the retention of data and the need for the Data Protection Commissioner to be informed of what data is being retained by the State.  In response to the debacle in England when a significant amount of personal data was lost in transit, not once but twice, by the British equivalent of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Data Protection Commissioner said that public information is safe.  When the Data Protection Commissioner stated that public information will be safe, he admitted a number of leaks from different Departments.</P>
        <P>At international level there is a move towards the maximum amount of data being on passports or on national identity cards and in terms of Big Brother security, there is a logic to it; the more information gathered in, the more can patterns of human behaviour be predicted and people who are a danger to the common good can be tracked.  The down side is the danger that those who are intent on putting public safety at risk, those intent on being a challenge to the common good, can access that material and subvert all the data being held by the State.</P>
        <P>The European Commission is proposing that all children over the age of six years should be fingerprinted for EU passports and national identity cards.  The only reason for not fingerprinting those younger than six years is a technical one; the fingerprints of children younger than six years seem not to be of sufficient quality for a one to one verification of identity.</P>
        <P>We should state implicitly that we want to include fingerprints or whatever.  I can give the Minister of State recent examples of those who are involved in the research of cryptography which has exposed major flaws in the retention of biometric data and how that data, despite all the guarantees, can be reconverted to allow identity theft.  In Belgium a team of cryptography researchers discovered that approximately 750,000 Belgian passports issued between 2004 and 2006 were not even encrypted and that the sensitive material they contained, including people&rsquo;s signatures and photographs, could be easily read using a commercial chip reader.  It did not even need to run the data through the machine.  It could be held a short distance away.  The team then looked at passports issued after 2006 following the change Belgium introduced, which it was claimed protected the chip in the future.  This is the same technology the Government and other governments are considering to retain information on a passport RFID chip.  The researchers were easily able to lower the possible combinations for a serial number to 24,000 and using the lowered figure it only took them half an hour to reconvert the identity data.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage I gave the example of the Japanese mathematician who, at a cost of only &pound;20, was able to take a finger, make a cast with a moulding plastic sold in hobby shops, pour some ordinary liquid gelatine, used in food preparation, into the mould and let it harden.  If this is stuck over a person&rsquo;s finger pad, it fools fingerprint detectors approximately 80% of the time.  The joy is that once the person has fooled the machine, because the fake fingerprints are made of the same substance as fruit pastilles, they can be eaten.  I gave another example of mathematicians who showed they could reconstruct a fingerprint solely from data contained in <Col N="555"/>systems such as that we are proposing to introduce on passports.  They printed out the images they made and used them to fool the fingerprint readers thereafter.</P>
        <P>There is a danger of identity theft and we need to consider carefully where we are going with this.  If the Minister wishes to go down the fingerprint road or even consider it for the future, he should be clear that is where he is going.  The Bill allows him to do it by regulation, which is not good enough.  It should be limited to what we have at the moment.  If at a stage in the future the Minister so wishes then he should introduce it by way of amendment.</P>
        <P>Considerable work has been done on this matter in the EU.  A working party was established which proposed the EU protection directive.  They considered the matter in depth.  That needs to be taken on board by the Members of the House when giving the Minister the powers in the future.  As currently drafted the Minister would have discretion to extend biometric information to include fingerprints, DNA, retina scans etc. without the scrutiny of the House.  We should delete the term &ldquo;including biometric data&rdquo; as proposed in my amendment and replace it with &ldquo;including data comprising information relating to a facial structure&rdquo;, which is what is there at the moment &mdash; a picture.  We should limit it to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>While I had not intended speaking on this amendment, having listened to the argument proposed, it strikes me that there is probably more personal information on a credit card than on a passport.  Yet while we have no difficulty with the bank knowing all our details, we have considerable difficulty with governments knowing it.  I would be the first person to say that individuals have a right to their privacy.  However, bearing in mind the proposed introduction by regulation of biometric details, it strikes me that this is precisely what we should seek for people with responsibility for small children.  Recent events should remind us that we should have as much information as possible on small children, particularly if they are to cross borders.  I am not sure how that should be done while accommodating the sensitivities of people who clearly have objections, which I do not dismiss.  However, we need to think carefully about the matter and keep in mind that a passport is a travel document concerned with ensuring that a citizen travels safely and is protected.  If those citizens happen to be vulnerable and there is a way to ensure their further protection, we should put that in place.  I am sure there would be major objections to what I am saying.  We need to be very measured and sensible about how we do this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The term &ldquo;biometric data&rdquo; is a generic term used to describe the measurement of distinguishing physiological traits of a living person.  These data are capable of being used in automated recognition systems.  The proposed amendment is too restrictive to allow even for the development of facial recognition technologies.  Already technologies are being developed to permit assessment of skin texture and shading to supplement calculations.  We need to provide flexibility to allow us keep up with changing technologies.</P>
        <P>The amendment would also prevent the Minister from including a second biometric indicator in the passport, which could be required in the future to allow Irish citizens to travel abroad.  There are no plans at the moment to add a second biometric indicator to the passport.  The Data Commissioner was consulted during the drafting of the Bill.  I am not able to accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash; but it is being pressed.  I am not objecting to any of these biometric data being included in the passport.  However, this House should have the debate on what biometric data should be included in the future so that we take the decision.  Deputy Kathleen Lynch is correct in what she has said about children.  We will hand a future Minister the power to demand that whatever biometric data he or she wishes must be included in a passport.  If we are to substantially change the way passports are being regulated we might as well get it right now.  The Minister of State has said there is no indication from Government that we will include citizens&rsquo; fingerprints.  However, if he believes that eventuality or other biometric indicators such as skin tone is coming down the track, it should be written in clear English that this is what will be included.  If there is insufficient scope in the five or six items I mentioned, including iris images, fingerprints, DNA or whatever, we can always amend it later.  I am trying to limit it to what exists at the moment unless someone can outline what we need to introduce in the future and say, for example, we need to introduce fingerprint data because the rest of the European Union has done so and it would restrict our movement and that children&rsquo;s safety, which is paramount, would be enhanced.  It is not intended to include those under six because it does not work with their fingerprints.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P FLI="0">If we are to take that route, where biometric data are listed in the Bill it should be clearly outlined exactly what data are involved, namely the physical characteristics concerning the facial structure.  I seek to limit it to that but if the Minister so wishes there is nothing to prevent him, at this late stage or in the Seanad, from expanding beyond that to include fingerprints or whatever.  At the very least, this House should be informed when that decision is taken.  Under the terms of the Bill, however, the Minister can take that decision by himself or herself and we will not have any way of arguing over it in future.</P>

        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;and, if father of the child is not a guardian but is named on the birth certificate of the child, such father,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 22 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 11, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(10) It shall not be lawful for a parent who is a guardian of a child to remove the child from the State, or retain the child outside the State, without the consent of the other parent, in the absence of an order of a court, provided that the other parent was named on the birth certificate or was exercising any care, access or entitlement in respect of the child during the period of 12 months prior to the removal or retention.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My contribution on the last amendment is connected as regards the details of how we can protect vulnerable people.  We will probably disagree about what is just or unjust.  I could name ten things I think are unjust, while I am sure the Minister of State could name ten things that are completely opposite to what I feel.</P>
        <P>One of the things I feel strongly about is the way fathers are treated in respect of their children.  Men and women come to me every week concerning relationship breakdown.  There is more relationship breakdown now than the standard marriage breakdown.  Men and women may not get on as partners but that does not necessarily mean that they are bad fathers or bad mothers.  Just because they are not guardians does not mean they should be deprived of their children.  Most partners in a relationship would give consent if the mother or father wanted to take their children on holiday, even a prolonged holiday, or take them away for educational reasons, or if the person got a job abroad and intended to stay abroad for three or six months.  That would not be a difficulty in a good, trusting relationship.</P>
        <P>A difficulty can arise, however, when, if a person assumes a relationship is solid, he or she does not have any say in whether their children can be taken out of the country or retained outside the country.  Neither amendment says that this sole right should be given to all non-guardian parents.  However, if the father&rsquo;s name is on the birth certificate there is a clear indication that he wants to be part of the child&rsquo;s life or the children&rsquo;s lives.  Equally, if one partner decides that he or she wants to go abroad with the children, it is wrong that the non-guardian parent should have no rights in this respect.  It should not happen.  It should be with the consent of both parents.  Although it is highly unusual the non-guardian parent might be the mother.  It is wrong that one parent should be allowed to deprive another parent of the company of or access to their children, or an input into their upbringing.  There may be very good reasons to deny that, but it is clearly a matter for the family law courts.  When it comes to travel and the issuance of passports and taking children abroad it should be with the consent of both parents.  If necessary, the courts may intervene and make an order to allow children to be taken abroad, even though a father does not give consent.  Alternatively, the courts may prevent children from being taken abroad without the father&rsquo;s consent.  It is probably the most unjust aspect of our law.</P><Col N="558"/>
        <P>The Labour Party is preparing a Bill to deal with this matter but we are now dealing with the Bill before us.  As someone who has spent years telling people how unjust the world is to women, in this aspect I feel the law is very unjust when it comes to dealing with fathers&rsquo; rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 14(1) provides that the consent of all guardians must be sought before issuance of a passport to a child or alternatively, as provided for in section 14(3), a court order dispensing with consent must be obtained.  Under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, married parents are joint guardians of their children.  By contrast, the father of a child born outside marriage is not automatically a guardian of his child.  Where a father is not a guardian of a child he may apply to the District Court to be appointed guardian, or he may become guardian by making a statutory declaration with the child&rsquo;s mother agreeing to his appointment as a guardian.  These options apply whether or not he is named on the child&rsquo;s certificate of birth.  Where a father is appointed guardian, his consent must be obtained prior to the issue of a passport in the same way as the consent of other guardians must be obtained.  Section 14(2) permits the Minister to take account of the circumstances of the case in deciding whether to issue a passport to a child without the consent of a non-guardian parent.  This discretion will allow the Minister to consider the views and rights of non-guardian parents in so far as they are known to him or her.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the intention of amendment No. 20.  However, changing the rights of a non-guardian parent through legislation is a family law matter.  This Bill is designed to regulate the passport service and is not an appropriate vehicle to introduce changes in family law.  Such matters are best handled by other Departments.  Similarly, amendment No. 22, which seeks to incorporate restrictions on the removal of a child from the State, deals with issues outside the remit of the Bill.  I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s intention but it is not appropriate to include such a provision in legislation dealing with the administration of the passport service.  I cannot accept its inclusion in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand fully what the Minister is saying.  However, most fathers who are in stable relationships do not apply to become guardians of their children.  It is the assumption of all of us when we get married or start living with someone that the relationship is for life.  One does not expect one&rsquo;s relationship to break down.  It is only when it starts to go wrong that applications are made to the courts.  We do not propose this amendment on the basis that mothers should be prevented from taking their children abroad.  That is not the issue.  It is a matter of ensuring there is consultation and that the input fathers have into their children&rsquo;s lives continues.  That is all the amendment seeks to ensure.  While it is strictly a family law matter, it is not outside the scope of the Bill.  It could be included.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, line 21, after &ldquo;duties&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;or for related or other purposes in accordance with generally accepted international practice&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to an issue that arose on Committee Stage.  In his response to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed that diplomatic passports are, as a matter of course, given to all previous holders of the office of Minister for Foreign <Col N="559"/>Affairs.  However, section 16 provides that diplomatic passports are to be used, as all Members are instructed, only in the course of one&rsquo;s duty, where one is travelling abroad on the instruction of the D&aacute;il or in pursuance of committee business.</P>
        <P>In this context, I am unclear as to the Minister&rsquo;s meaning.  I see a contradiction in that most previous Ministers for Foreign Affairs are no longer Oireachtas Members.  Amendment No. 23 proposes the insertion of &ldquo;or for related or other purposes in accordance with generally accepted international practice&rdquo; after &ldquo;duties&rdquo;.  This seems the only way to get around it.  It is unacceptable that persons who are no longer elected Members have diplomatic passports while Members are told those passports cannot be used other than for official purposes.  This amendment seems to be the only way to clarify the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 16 permits the Minister to issue a diplomatic passport to an officer of the Minister of diplomatic rank or, under subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), to a person or one of a class of persons to whom the Minister considers it appropriate to issue such a passport.  This permits reasonably broad discretion to designate who should be eligible for a diplomatic passport.</P>
        <P>Deputy Lynch&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Higgins, indicated his intention on Committee Stage to put forward an amendment in connection with the issuing of diplomatic passports to former Ministers for Foreign Affairs.  Diplomatic passports can now be issued to all former Ministers.  This section makes clear that such passports are intended to be used in connection with the performance of official duties abroad.  This is in line with international practice and is a reasonable requirement.  It is not permitted to use a diplomatic passport for travel for unofficial purposes such as personal or holiday travel.  Individuals should use their personal passports for those purposes.  Holders of diplomatic passports are not required to return them between trips abroad on official business.  They are advised and expected to comply with the conditions under which they are issued and, in future, with the requirements of this Bill if enacted.</P>
        <P>It is not necessary to extend the purposes for which diplomatic passports may be issued.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to section 16 (1)(<i>b</i>) which refers to &ldquo;a person, or one of a class of persons, to whom the Minister considers it appropriate to issue such a passport&rdquo;.  There is broad discretion to designate who should be eligible for a diplomatic passport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not consider the matter of Mr. Turner&rsquo;s passport to be a cause for great concern.  I might be one of the few of that opinion.  If he was entitled to a passport, there is nothing more to it.  However, this is a different issue.  How many diplomatic passports were issued to people other than diplomats and Ministers?  Is it a significant quantity and what category of person is involved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>High Court judges, for example, are included in that, so the number would be in the region of 100.</P>

	<P>Are business people included in that number?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>No, they are not included in the numbers for diplomatic passports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I will return to this issue at a different time by way of a parliamentary question.  I remain of the view that there is an anomaly in that elected Members must abide by certain rules in regard to diplomatic passports while others who hold them are not bound by the same rules.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">At the outset of this important debate, I wish to express in the strongest possible terms the opposition of the Labour Party to exploitation and discrimination in the workplace, against any employee, whether full-time or part-time, contract or agency.  We deplore the situation where a section of our workforce, namely agency workers, has not been afforded the same level of protection in our employment laws, from the perspective of job security, access to sick pay and pension entitlements or to other non-pay benefits, that are considered the norm for comparable employees working in the same industry.</P>
       <P>The founding ethos of my party was to promulgate, espouse and acknowledge the principle of equality.  The Labour Party, along with Sinn F&eacute;in, is tonight focusing on the plight and treatment of agency workers, including vulnerable migrant workers, who are being subjected to inferior pay and conditions and naked exploitation.  I am proud to say that my party was founded by Connolly and Larkin with an ethos of promulgating, espousing and acknowledging <Col N="562"/>the principle of equality.  The motion I have moved supports and underpins the principle of equal treatment for all workers.  It calls on the Government to protect the rights of agency workers and to support the introduction of the long-promised EU directive on temporary agency workers.</P>
        <P>Trade unions across the EU have for many years been engaged in an ongoing campaign for equal pay, conditions and status for all &ldquo;atypical&rdquo; workers.  They have achieved considerable success throughout the Union.  Unbelievably, our Government and by extension our country is laggard in the important area of employment standards and conditions.  Agency work increasingly means discrimination in the workplace, poorer pay and denial of sick, holiday and overtime pay.  It is often used by employers as a means of avoiding many of their responsibilities.  The vast majority of EU member states have dealt with this problem &mdash; the use by employers of agency workers as a means of paying lower wages and introducing lower standards &mdash; by implementing laws which provide for equality of treatment of agency workers and comparable staff.  Most member states&rsquo; laws are based on the &ldquo;non-discrimination principle&rdquo;, which means that agency workers must receive the same terms and conditions as comparable permanent employees in the user enterprise.</P>
        <P>Agency workers in Belgium must be paid the same wages, and be given the same terms and conditions, as permanent workers in the user enterprise.  Spanish law was modified in 1999 to ensure parity of pay with that provided for in the collective agreement of the sector to which the agency worker is assigned.  The law in Portugal has established parity of pay and conditions with permanent workers.  In Greece, an agency worker&rsquo;s pay must not be lower than that set under the relevant collective agreement within the employment agency.  The equal wages clause in the Netherlands can be varied, but only by a collective agreement with the permanent agency.  The pay of an agency worker in France is linked to the amount of money a post-probationary permanent employee with the same qualifications would earn in that post.  French agency workers are also eligible for an end of assignment payment equal to 10% of the gross pay earned during the assignment, as well as compensation equivalent to a further 10% in lieu of paid holidays, to which they are not entitled.  French employment law also provides for a compulsory levy of 2% of payroll costs for training.  Since 2004, agencies in Germany have been obliged to guarantee their workers the same pay and collective conditions as permanent staff in the user enterprise unless a collective agreement is made to the contrary.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, might suggest that I have confined myself to references to &ldquo;old&rdquo; member states.  However, action has also been taken in countries which joined the EU in more recent times.  Laws guaranteeing equal pay and treatment for agency workers have been introduced in the majority of post-2004 member states, including Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.  A trawl across the EU shows that the United Kingdom, Hungary and, shamefully, Ireland are the only member states which have not respected the non-discrimination principle by legislating for equal pay and conditions between agency workers and comparable employees in the user enterprise.  Hungary introduced a definition of &ldquo;employee leasing&rdquo; in its labour law in 2001.  It clarified the contractual position and obligations of all parties but stopped short of imposing an equal pay principle.  Many member states have gone further by reinforcing the equal treatment, or non-discrimination, principle with additional measures to ensure that agency workers are used for bona fide reasons.  Seven member states have defined in law specific reasons for which an employer may have recourse to agency workers.  Five member states limit the duration of agency work and four member states set limits to the sector and occupation usage.</P>
        <P>In Spain, agency work is prohibited in certain sectors, including the public service and for &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; work.  Legislation was introduced in Poland in 2003 to provide for a maximum <Col N="563"/>agency employment period of an aggregate of 12 months over a period of 36 consecutive months.  The maximum permitted duration of the use of agency workers is connected to the reasons for use in Poland and Belgium.  In Portugal, if the justification for the use of agency workers is the temporary substitution of permanent workers, the duration of that use must correspond to the duration of the justifying cause.  In Greece, a user company may not employ agency workers for a total period of over eight months.  If that period is exceeded, the contract between the agency worker is automatically transformed into an open-ended &ldquo;contract of indefinite duration&rdquo; between the agency worker and the client firm.  Neither the objective nor the outcome of agency working in France can be to fill a post in the client company for a &ldquo;lengthy period&rdquo;.  In any case, the maximum duration is 18 months, including renewals.  In Slovenia, agency workers cannot be used by the user firm &ldquo;continuously&rdquo;, or to replace striking workers, or if there have been collective redundancies in the past three years, or in other cases determined by sectoral agreements.  An agency in the Czech Republic may assign an employee to the same user for a maximum of 12 months, unless the employee requests a longer period.  Collective agreements in Sweden are concluded with agencies&rsquo; representative organisations by sector.  Collective agreements typically provide that 75% of the full monthly salary must be paid regardless of whether the agency workers engage in work.  The Swedish white collar agency agreement provides for 80% of the normal weekly wage.</P>
        <P>Numerous EU member states have addressed this issue in one way or another, but Ireland is lagging behind.  The Minister of State may refer to Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment protection legislation, but it is not working.  The Government&rsquo;s wishy-washy amendment is of no use.  I am not interested in mealy-mouthed speeches from the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues.  We should not engage in tokenism in this debate.  Tomorrow night, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in will give every Member of this House an opportunity to march through the lobbies &mdash; it will be time to put up or shut up.  We will no longer tolerate Deputies who are all things to all people in their constituencies but do not express the views of workers when they get an opportunity to make decisions on important matters in the D&aacute;il, to which they have been elected by their constituents.  The problems to which I refer are being encountered in every county in Ireland.  It is no excuse to say that difficulties are not happening.</P>
        <P>Those involved in the trade union movement know that a great deal of sympathy has been expressed for the plight of Irish and migrant workers.  However, I remind the Minister of State that sympathy does not buy the tea.  We will give Deputies an opportunity to make their views known when the House divides tomorrow night.  We do not want any nice token speeches from Members on the Government side.  The amendment that has been tabled is as wishy-washy as any amendment I have ever seen.  Perhaps the Government is playing for time, but we will continue to hound it until this matter is resolved.  We will not accept professions of closet socialism from Deputies who act in a manner that is the antithesis of socialism.  Fundamentally, socialism is about equality of treatment and parity of esteem when it comes to wages and ancillary benefits.  The response of this House to tonight&rsquo;s motion is being watched extremely carefully not just by one corner of the trade union movement, but across the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and similar bodies.  I remind the Minister of State that all his colleagues on the Government side are being given an opportunity to set the record straight.</P>
        <P>The EU directive on temporary agency work has the stated objective of providing the minimum level of protection for temporary agency workers.  The Union proposes to establish the principle of non-discrimination of working conditions, including pay, between temporary agency workers and comparable workers in the user undertaking as soon as the temporary agency worker has completed six weeks work in the same user undertaking.  Is that the reason Ireland is lagging behind?  Is the Government afraid to bring forward and sign up to the legislation?  The Government should forget about the other countries.</P><Col N="564"/>
        <P>Shame on Britain with a Labour government that has not implemented this.  I salute Andrew Miller and colleague MPs in the labour movement who over the next week will try to bring forward a motion similar to ours in the House of Commons.  Many Labour MPs must find a solid home on the Conservative benches.</P>
        <P>If the Labour Party were part of Government, this is the first issue we would tackle and the first Bill we would put through.  We would not worry about other matters that currently take priority in Government time.  This is where we would come from.  This is what we were founded for in Clonmel and this is why we were with the workers in 1913 to ensure the principle of parity and equal treatment would be put on the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>This directive has been subject to amendments, but why should we have to wait until it is agreed before Ireland can legislate for the equal treatment principle?  What is going on in Government?  The vast majority of other EU states have implemented laws giving effect to the equal treatment principle.  The equal treatment-non-discrimination principle applies in Ireland in respect of fixed-term and part-time workers.  What is required, therefore, is the development of legal provisions that would provide that agency workers would be guaranteed equal treatment and be protected from less favourable treatment than other workers in the user undertaking.</P>
        <P>It is against the background of a downturn in the economy that we in the Labour Party feel there is a particular obligation on all of us to ensure adequate measures are in place to prevent the exploitation of low paid and vulnerable workers, especially those employed through agencies.  Temporary staff employed through agencies are particularly open to exploitation as they generally have little or no job security or access to sick pay and pensions or other non-paid benefit.  The Minister should not doubt there is a growing anger among workers at the failure of the Government to enact domestic legislation to protect agency workers, and particularly at the Government&rsquo;s ongoing decision to block the enactment of the draft temporary agency workers&rsquo; directive, which would provide protection for workers across all member states.</P>
        <P>The directive was approved by the members of the European Parliament in November 2002 but has been blocked at the Council of Employment Ministers for more than five years.  Sadly, this blockage has been led by both Ireland and Britain.  There is no excuse for the Minister or the Government continuing to block this key directive, unless they want to continue to turn a blind eye to the exploitation of vulnerable workers.  I hope this motion will put pressure on the Government parties to reverse their position and recognise as a fundamental human right the principle of equal treatment.  In addition, we would like to ensure the right of workers employed by agencies to become members of trade unions, and to be afforded the right of trade union representation, that the circumstances in which agency workers would be employed would be restricted and that a maximum period would be specified beyond which the worker must become a direct employee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sight should not be lost of the fact that the exploitation of agency workers not only causes significant problems for the workers concerned, which is extremely serious, but also poses a significant threat to the rest of the workforce whose pay and conditions of employment will be undermined unless such exploitation is brought to an end.  This is why I salute the trade union movement, and in particular SIPTU and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who are determined to campaign for as long as it takes to secure the right to equal treatment for all employees, full-time or part-time, permanent or temporary, direct or agency.  The majority of workers from EU states coming to Ireland are recruited by agencies as temporary workers.  Without the protection of employment legislation, they can be, and are being, exploited by greedy employers.  I was contacted about 50 workers let go in Galway, some of whom were <Col N="565"/>informed by text message and others by telephone.  I thought we had left 1913 behind.  Are we entering a new era where workers can be thrown on the scrapheap at the drop of a hat?  The labour movement will not stand for that and that is why we will champion the cause.</P>
        <P>Irish workers are being displaced by this artificially created pool of cheap labour.  A number of my colleagues have alluded to the Government adopting a somewhat hypocritical position regarding these goings on.  On the one hand, it is publicly espousing social partnership as the way forward for the economy, while, on the other, it has been to the forefront of a small minority of four of the 27 member states of the EU that have opposed the draft directive, which would greatly enhance workers&rsquo; rights in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The directive is essential legislation if a level playing field is to be created for workers and for decent employers.  It would set down under EU law a series of minimum rights for all temporary workers in Europe such as the right to access the host company&rsquo;s social services, the right to in-house health and safety training and the right to access permanent positions.  It would ensure rogue employers would not be able to use the lack of legal protection for agency workers to circumvent employment protection by replacing permanent staff with such workers.  It would also protect responsible employment agencies, which also need to be protected from unfair competition on the part of other operations.</P>
        <P>Recently, the general president of SIPTU, Jack O&rsquo;Connor, indicated there would be no further social partnership agreements unless the abuse of agency workers ends and their right to equal treatment with other workers is enshrined in law.  The union has been to the forefront in organising a series of meetings around the country, as part of its campaign to obtain a better deal for agency workers.  The Labour Party agrees with the president who indicated that the current situation is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue.  He has asserted that we currently have a deplorable rented labour system, in which vulnerable people have no employment rights in practical terms and that the nearest parallel to the present phenomenon that affects tens of thousands of workers in Ireland is slavery.  The president of SIPTU is dealing with this issue, with Patricia King and other officials on the ground.  This is real, not pie in the sky.  They can back up this assertion with facts.</P>
        <P>SIPTU has acknowledged the existence of quite legitimate employment agencies functioning to facilitate the ebb and flow of business in various sectors of the economy, but some agencies are ratcheting down the security and equality of employment rights for everyone who works in Ireland.  Sometimes this phenomenon is defended on the rather spurious grounds of protecting flexibility and meeting the competitiveness challenge.  As Mr. O&rsquo;Connor has said, this does nothing of the sort.  The reverse is the case because it defers the day when we have to face up to the urgent need to up-skill about a half a million workers in our economy.</P>
        <P>At our conference on 17 November 2007, I indicated, on behalf of the Labour Party, our view that the Government&rsquo;s opposition to the draft European directive in this area is totally misplaced and that the Government should immediately review its position.  I referred to the Irish Ferries dispute and the GAMA construction scandal.  I saluted the trade union movement on the strong stand it took, which mobilised mass public support and enabled a satisfactory solution for the workers involved.  One must concur with the objective to establish a &ldquo;threshold of decency&rdquo; in employment standards for all workers in Ireland.  The Government refers to the terms of the Towards 2016 agreement regulating employment agencies and agency workers, but my fear is that, while these measures are welcome, they represent moves which are of a cosmetic nature in so far as they are more procedural than substantive.</P>
        <P>In view of the Government&rsquo;s continued opposition to the draft EU directive, the Labour Party&rsquo;s view is that new legislation is required to ensure that recruitment agencies are not used to circumvent equality provisions of employment and agency workers are not treated as second-<Col N="566"/>class citizens.  We must ensure that we do not end up with a two-tier workforce, where one set of workers have fewer rights, less protection and are paid less than others doing the same work.  We gave a solemn commitment at the Labour Party conference to the wider labour movement that we would draft a Bill to provide agency workers with the same terms and conditions of employment enjoyed by full-time employees.  We are ready to fulfil that commitment and will lay a Bill before the House in the next few weeks.  We will challenge the Government to put up or shut up and, having drafted the Bill, we will ask the Government to take it in its time.  We will co-operate in every way, as I have no doubt will the rest of the House, to ensure such legislation is put on the Statute Book in the shortest time.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing time.  I second the motion, the purpose of which is to stem the rising tide of exploitation resulting from the failure to legislate for the principle of equal treatment for agency workers.  This joint motion, tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party, demands that the abuse of agency workers should be ended and that their rights to equal treatment with other workers be enshrined in law.</P>
        <P>Not only are agency workers being denied rights and entitlements, such as sick pay, holiday pay, overtime and rates of pay equivalent to permanent staff, but increasing numbers of new jobs are temporary and filled by agency workers.  The employment of agency workers is resulting in the displacement of directly employed workers.  The absence of legislation providing for the principle of equal treatment for agency workers means they are being used by employers to drive down wages and sidestep duties to directly employed workers.  If this issue is not addressed, we risk returning to casual labour reminiscent of the 19th or early 20th century.  Agency workers are little better off than the labourers of that era.  In practical terms, vulnerable agency workers have effectively no employment rights.  That is a scandal.</P>
        <P>Despite repeated commitments made to the trade union movement in the course of partnership negotiations, the Government is not living up to its responsibilities to protect workers&rsquo; rights.  The unions have had to fight aggressively for improvements such as the recent increases in the number of labour inspectors.  They are now being forced to fight on this issue.  It is not good enough for the Government to tell us it intends to bring forward legislation in the future.  In the fight to stop exploitation every day counts.  The implications of any further delay in dealing with this issue cannot be overstated.  It is time for the Government to fulfil its obligation to protect decent work standards for all workers.</P>
        <P>The absence of adequate legislation to protect agency workers is like a cancer in the Irish labour market.  If it is not addressed exploitation will spread aggressively and invasively through all workplaces and sectors.  Already its effects are evident in construction, hotel and services, retail, logistics, red meat processing and mushroom farming.  Further delays in introducing the legislation we demand will be detrimental for individual workers and employment conditions, as well as grossly unfair to good employers who are put at such a competitive disadvantage that they are forced to compete in a disgraceful race to the bottom.</P>
        <P>We should not have to deal with this issue because it should have been resolved long ago.  Most other members of the European Union, including the majority of new member states, have introduced laws to deal with the problem of employers using agency work as a means to pay less and introduce lower standards through legislation providing for equality of employment between agency workers and comparable permanent staff.  Many member states further reinforce the equal treatment and non-discrimination principle with additional measures to ensure that agency work is used for genuine reasons.  Not only has the Government failed to introduce domestic legislation on this issue, it has shamefully played a pivotal role in blocking <Col N="567"/>an EU directive on temporary agency workers.  It is time for the Government to stop stalling on domestic legislation and to drop its opposition to the proposed EU directive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, I attended a public meeting on agency workers in Waterford.  At that meeting SIPTU&rsquo;s general president, Jack O&rsquo;Connor, described the defining characteristic of this issue as silence.  He was correct; this issue has not received enough media attention and some workers are unaware of the threats looming over their current terms and conditions of employment.  People need to be crystal clear about the inevitable consequence of failing to deal with this issue.  The campaign by the trade union movement is putting it on the agenda.  By tabling this joint Sinn F&eacute;in-Labour motion we hope to give further momentum to that campaign by ensuring this Government gets the message that workers simply will not stand by and allow their rights and standards of employment to be eroded. </P>
        <P>It is important to understand how this situation came about.  While employment agencies have a legitimate function in various sectors of the economy and can play an important role in meeting the short-term needs of certain employers, the phenomenon which has developed in recent years is entirely different.  In a study of the problem published in 2002, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions identified temporary agency work as the most rapidly growing form of atypical employment in the 1990s, spurring most decent states with social consciences which had not already done so to introduce legislation to provide for the principle of equal treatment.</P>
        <P>A loophole in our employment rights regime is being exploited with dire consequences for all workers.  The figures are astonishing.  We now have 520 agencies for a population of 4 million people.  What started off as an innocuous form of temporary labour between permanent jobs or to cover maternity leave has mutated into something far more sinister.  While temporary agency workers have some minimal legal protection, such as minimum wages, this is totally inadequate and far from a guaranteed right to equal treatment with the directly employed workforce, the pay and conditions of whom are generally significantly above the minimum.  The deficiencies in legislation covering the employment of agency workers has been grasped by certain employers keen to avoid normal obligations to their workers.  There have even been cases whereby companies have established agencies to employ all their staff.  These employers have realised they can use agency workers as a source of cheap labour.  In what other scenario could one employ two groups of workers side by side and pay one group less money than another while making them work longer hours, denying them holidays, sacking them when they are sick and denying them redundancy packages?  This is what agency workers are subject to every day.</P>
        <P>It is unacceptable that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has failed to publish data on the number of placements for temporary workers since 1999.  Regardless of whether this is intentional, it is difficult to get a picture of exactly how many workers are being employed in this manner.  It is also difficult to establish numbers because of the ambiguity surrounding whether the user company or the agency actually employs the worker.  What cannot be denied is that the number of agency workers is growing and that their increased use is linked to the avoidance of ordinary employer obligations in regard to workers&rsquo; rights and entitlements.</P>
        <P>Every Member of the D&aacute;il will be familiar with cases of exploitation of agency workers and undercutting and displacement of existing workers as a result of the employment of agency workers.  While the Government fails to acknowledge the extent of the problems that have <Col N="568"/>developed as a result of its inaction, I have no doubt that Government backbenchers will be able to outline many cases from constituencies across the State.</P>
        <P>I would like to highlight a number of cases that have recently come to my attention.  The use of agency workers to depress wages and conditions of employment has particularly taken hold in the construction sector.  It is now the case that few workers can find employment in the construction sector without joining an agency.  Developers and contractors have hit upon a loophole that allows them to ride roughshod over workers&rsquo; rights and the Government is allowing them get away with it.  Tonight we are joined in the Gallery by a number of men who were recently fired from a local authority-owned site in Kildare by a construction firm that has refused to employ PAYE workers since last year.  The site is populated by agency workers and the men were fired for refusing to become self-employed C2 and C45 workers and for refusing to waive their trade union membership.</P>
        <P>Last week, I met a Kilkenny man who works in the construction sector.  He had many experiences of ill-treatment and discrimination, the most startling of which was that for years he was paid a construction sector grade D wage for a job which should have been paid at the higher grade A rate based on his skills.  The differential of &euro;2 an hour every hour of every day went to the agency which employed him.  When a union eventually intervened and managed to ensure he received the appropriate wage, he did not receive a cent in back money from the agency that had literally been robbing him for the entire period.</P>
        <P>The use of agency workers also has implications in terms of health and safety.  The latter is one of the reasons agency work is prohibited in Spain as being dangerous.  At a recent meeting in Waterford organised as part of the trade campaign for equal rights for agency workers, those present were shown video footage of Polish workers using a guillotine to cut marble.  The workers in question were not using any protective gear because their employer refused to provide it.  The men&rsquo;s hands were continually under the guillotine and a SIPTU official recalled how he met men who had lost fingers doing the job.  Those men worked Saturdays and Sundays for a flat rate and were accommodated in cramped, dirty and unsafe conditions.  They had no choice in where they lived.  The message from their employer was clear &mdash; &ldquo;If you leave my accommodation, you leave my employment.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Lest anyone think that the employment of agency workers is restricted to one industry, it should be known that agencies are being used in almost every sector.  I know a young woman who, straight from college, went to an agency seeking clerical work.  She was placed in a well-known IT firm as a receptionist.  She discovered within a short period that her directly employed co-workers, some of whom had fewer responsibilities than she, received better pay, had better holiday entitlements and were treated to much better conditions overall.  She had no contact with the agency except to receive her payslip each week.  The woman was expected to carry out far more duties by the company where she was placed than the agency had employed her to do and when, after a number of years, she asked her workplace management why they would not make her permanent, she was informed that they did not want to employ her on foot of overhead or budgetary reasons.  We all know the reasons the company would not employ her directly.  The worst aspect of this case is that the woman did not even know she was being exploited.  She had never even heard the term &ldquo;agency worker&rdquo; in the context we are using it in this debate.</P>
        <P>The situation is similar for the many non-national workers who become trapped in agencies.  They do not know their rights and are not familiar with the labour laws in this State.  The Government is doing little or nothing to protect them.</P><Col N="569"/>
        <P Just="Left">Excuses made by Ministers in the past for the failure to legislate for equal rights of agency workers simply do not stand up.  Claims have been made about a potential loss of competitiveness that would result from cracking down on the exploitative use of agency workers.  No excuse can be made that would justify the exploitation of vulnerable workers.  Every state in Europe which ranks ahead of us in terms of competitiveness has some form of protective legislation.  It is also important to note that there has been no evidence of any negative effect on labour market flexibility in those states which have such legislation.  A successful economy cannot be based on a race to the bottom in respect of workers&rsquo; rights and wages because there will always be lower-wage developing economies which can undercut their more developed counterparts.  While the Minister for Finance acknowledged this in the past, it is deeply disappointing that competitiveness is still being offered as a spurious excuse for the failure of the Government to protect decent working standards.  The Government must accept that while there can be flexibility when it comes to drawing up an employee&rsquo;s contract, there cannot be flexibility as regards his or her fundamental rights and entitlements.</P>
        <P>In respect of the call for the reduction in the waiting time before agency workers receive their entitlements, the trade union movement has made proposals which would see the period before such workers receive direct recognition reduced from six weeks to four.  Sinn F&eacute;in strongly supports this call.  My party would go so far as to say that we should debate whether there should be pay parity from the initial date of employment, with other entitlements coming into play after the four-week period.</P>
        <P>There is always the fear that employers, particularly those in the construction sector where jobs can be short lived, can hire somebody for six weeks and then let them go.  Such employers have found loopholes to allow exploitation before.  They will seek them again.  Sinn F&eacute;in firmly believes that a person doing the same work as somebody else should be entitled to the same payment from the outset.  We do not have an apartheid system in this State, or at least we should not have one.  We cannot, without deep shame, put two workers beside each other and treat them differently for the sake of saving a few bob.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What this motion seeks and what the trade union movement is demanding is the immediate introduction of legislation to provide that agency workers should be guaranteed equal pay and treatment and be protected from being less favourably treated than other workers in the user undertaking.  Such legislation needs to specify a maximum period for which agency workers would be employed and also a maximum period beyond which such workers must become direct employees.</P>
        <P>It is also important that the right of workers employed by agencies to trade union representation be protected.  The status of the employer needs to be clearly established in law so that &mdash; unlike current ambiguous system &mdash; agencies&rsquo; responsibilities are spelled out.  In addition, the inclusion in such legislation of occupational restrictions similar to those introduced in other states, where the use of agency workers for certain occupations is excluded on health and safety grounds, should be considered.</P>
        <P>If employers can continue to employ agency workers and treat them as they do at present, we will continue to see the erosion of workers&rsquo; rights across the entire economy.  Agency workers will be used to depress wages in every sector and to destabilise job security for every worker in the State.  The exploitation spreads.  It is spreading even as we debate this matter.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to fighting for legislation that delivers equal rights for agency workers.  We will work with the trade unions, the Labour Party and others to ensure that the Government introduces legislation without further delay.  We also want to see this issue addressed in the North.  Sinn F&eacute;in tabled a motion at the Northern Ireland Assembly demanding equal treatment for agency workers.  That motion received all-party support.  Those <Col N="570"/>of us concerned about the future of workers&rsquo; rights must unite in this demand.  All Members who want to see exploitation stamped out must support the motion.</P>
        <P>This is a crucial issue for working people, particularly in the context of their terms and conditions.  It is important to all workers, whether they be agency or permanent, immigrant or Irish.  The cancer of exploitation to which I refer will drive the race to the bottom.</P>
        <P>This morning, Louth County Council unanimously passed a motion, tabled by my colleague, Councillor Jim Loughran, which supports the thrust of the motion before the House.  I hope all local authorities will do likewise.  The trade union movement will continue to drive the campaign on this issue.  That campaign will have the support of Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party.</P>
        <P>Legislation relating to the minimum wage is insufficient to resolve this matter.  There are concerns that said minimum wage will form the basis of any new legislation which might be introduced.  Craftsmen and craftswomen, tradesmen and tradeswomen are entitled to considerably more than the minimum wage.  Long-term agreements have been established between the trade union movement and employers and these cannot be eroded.  There can be no going back.  This issue must be dealt with.  Workers and their representatives will win this battle.</P>

<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I wish to share time with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  As Minister of State responsible for labour affairs, I am glad to have the opportunity of debating the important issue of temporary agency workers.  There has been much public comment about this issue in recent times.</P>
        <P>Before getting into the detail of the issues, I wish to place on record that the Government is deeply committed to decent standards of employment.  Any objective analysis of the Government&rsquo;s record, and that of the previous Governments led by our Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, will show that over the last ten years or so, significant and substantial measures have been taken to underpin employment standards which have surpassed that of any other administration.</P>
        <P>An extensive range of employment rights has been extended to cover the protection of working conditions of temporary workers, including agency workers, in the past decade.  I am speaking here about core standards and employment rights which workers can vindicate.  Furthermore, this period has also seen the introduction of the national minimum wage, a ground-breaking measure that for the first time secured a wage floor for workers.</P>
        <P>Developments have included improvements across a wide spectrum of conditions of employment, from daily to weekly rest periods as well as annual and public holiday entitlements which are a feature of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  There has also been comprehensive legislative measures to protect temporary workers employed under fixed-term contracts and in respect of part-time work.</P>
        <P>Fundamentally, section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, which transposed into Irish legislation the EU directive on posting of workers, provides that employee protection legislation applies to migrant workers in the same way as to Irish nationals.  These include agency workers assigned by an overseas agency, as employer, to work under the control and direction of an end-user enterprise in Ireland who may obtain the benefits and protection of Irish labour law.</P>
        <P>Agency workers also fall within the ambit of protection under employment equality legislation with its focus on non-discrimination.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>In addition, the Government have delivered a further range of measures in support of improved and enhanced employment standards arising from commitments agreed in Towards 2016.  The Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundances and Related Matters) Act 2007 has been enacted and the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, has been established.  It has commenced operations with significant management resources, and it will have a full complement of 90 labour inspectors, including ten with specific foreign language skills.</P><Col N="572"/>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to provide some context to today&rsquo;s debate by endeavouring to correctly site issues of concern which are an aspect of this debate.  I propose to outline some key features and attributes of the temporary agency sector, including the main activities of the employment agency sector and the nature of employment and contractual arrangements in the sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Tentative data suggests temporary agency working comprises a relatively small subset of our total employment, perhaps as low as 2%.  Agency workers operate across the full spectrum of our economy and are beyond the two sectors which are the focus of the Private Members&rsquo; motion, which focuses solely on the construction and hotel sectors.  Many sectors where temporary or agency workers are employed are in higher-paid parts of the economy where recruitment agencies successfully match and place workers in highly skilled jobs.  These include finance, accountancy, information and computer technology and pharmaceuticals, where pay and conditions of employment are not an issue.</P>
        <P>The matters before this House primarily concern the supply by an employment agency, as employer, of a temporary agency worker who is assigned to work under the control of an end-user enterprise.  The discussion over temporary workers is at its most acute in the case of temporary agency workers, as this form of employment is uniquely differentiated and complicated by the triangular nature of the relationship between the worker, agency and end user.</P>
        <P>The kernel of the matters under discussion relate to the potential exploitation of foreign agency workers in terms of their pay and conditions of employment compared to Irish nationals in the same sector of employment.  Core concerns relate to employment agencies as employers who operate outside the State and assign workers to this jurisdiction.  These concerns relate to the potential use of foreign agency workers &mdash; who would be better protected as permanent employees &mdash; by employers to circumnavigate the employment rights of such agency workers, or to allow employers evade their responsibilities.</P>
        <P>Despite frequent assertions to the contrary, Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive body of employment rights legislation provides that employee protection applies to migrant workers and agency workers in Ireland who have entered into a contract of employment that provides for him or her being employed in the State, or who works in the State under a contract of employment.  I should be clear that this means irrespective of nationality or place of residence, such persons have the same rights under employment rights legislation as Irish employees.  As I have already indicated, we vested migrant workers with the same rights as can be vindicated by Irish employees.  This was acknowledged by SIPTU, which has included a full listing of such employment right entitlements in an information leaflet on agency workers from June 2007.</P>
        <P>Our legislative framework is backed up with effective and strong new supports, where all workers, including migrant workers and foreign agency workers, can vindicate their rights with the dispute settlement machinery of the State.  Again, under commitments in Towards 2016, we have committed to and delivered on core elements, including a major upgrading of resources in the labour inspectorate, having given it a decentralised and regional structure.</P>
        <P>NERA is processing the last of its appointments to bring it to a full complement and when completed the resources of the labour inspectorate will have trebled to 90 inspectors, including ten with specialist language skills.  NERA is now playing a very active, vital and substantive role in tackling potential abuses and will respond to breaches of employment rights legislation by seeking redress in the first instance and, where appropriate, prosecution.  In this regard, as I have stated in my recent replies on this matter to this House, I urge anyone who has evidence <Col N="573"/>of the mistreatment of agency workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter<b>.</b></P>
        <P>Employment rights, employment protection and concerns about the operation of some employment agencies was the subject of consideration at the most recent partnership discussions.  This is in recognition of the need to review current legislation in this area, the Employment Agency Act 1971, which is now more than 30 years in place.  During this period our employment market has been transformed, with substantial annual economic growth, which has fuelled a demand from employers for migrant workers to meet the needs of the manufacturing and services sectors of our economy.</P>
        <P>Employment agencies have responded by developing their services to meet the needs of employers and potential employees.  The Government accepts arrangements put in place several decades ago, under the 1971 Act, to regulate a much quieter and far less complex labour and recruitment market, need to be overhauled to meet the demands of a much larger and rapidly-changing employment environment.</P>
        <P>We have seen the emergence of new forms of recruitment and employment that can pose problems in terms of customer protection and quality control.  Recognising this, an initial review of the sector resulted in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment issuing a White Paper in June 2005 on the review of the Employment Agency Act 1971.  The White Paper took account of a range of submissions received as part of a consultation process, including submissions from Irish Congress of Trade Unions, IBEC, the National Recruitment Federation and the Immigrant Council of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The main problems reflected in the review related to agencies as employers rather than agencies as &ldquo;matchmakers&rdquo;.  In the main, they concerned agencies based outside the State but placing workers in this jurisdiction.  It was acknowledged that any attempt to enforce an extra-territorial dimension in a statutory licensing framework would present a challenge, and it remains a challenge, not least in the context of obligations under the Single Market.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, issues arising in this debate became subsumed into the broader social partnership discussions in early 2006 and formed part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments under Towards 2016.  In this context, my colleague the Minister, Deputy Martin, and I are currently considering the final elements of proposals for the draft scheme of a Bill to regulate the employment agency sector.  It will be presented for consideration by the Government very shortly, with a view to having the Bill drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
        <P>The Bill as drafted will reflect the commitment in Towards 2016 to a licensing system where, to be licensed, employment agencies will be required to comply with the terms of a statutory code of practice which will set out the practices and standards which employment agencies would be expected to follow.  It is envisaged that a monitoring and advisory committee will advise on the code of practice and on other matters related to this sector of our economy.  This committee would include representatives of the social partners.  Other elements in the Bill are being finalised with a view to further strengthening and enhancing the effective enforcement of the employment rights of agency workers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the course of consultations on the proposed Bill, other matters were raised which were not agreed under Towards 2016, including pay parity from the commencement of employment.  There have been strong assertions from trade unions that agency workers are being used increasingly to undermine basic labour standards and are precipitating a race to the bottom.  However, the Department has not been provided with nor has it been able to find specific evidence supporting such assertions.  I urge anybody with any information to bring it in.</P>

	<P>They should bring it to NERA&rsquo;s attention.</P>
        <P>Similarly, it has been alleged that Ireland is one of only three EU member states which has failed to legislate for equal treatment for agency workers in terms of pay and conditions of employment.  However, the position is far more complex than that portrayed.  For example, in those member states where legislation is complemented by collective agreements, deviation from the equal wage clause in legislation may be permitted.</P>
        <P>There is also wide variation in the nature and extent of wider employment rights and working conditions available to agency workers in collective agreements, such as in the case of statutory sick pay and pension rights.  In addition, in some member states various restrictions and prohibitions are in place in which agency working is excluded from whole sectors of economic activity.  This also reduces opportunities for agency workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>It reduces opportunities in that they are nearly slaves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulation of temporary work has been a contentious issue at European level for over a quarter of a century since the European Commission first placed proposals on the table in 1982.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The transformation of the product and labour markets since then has only intensified debate about how best to balance, on the one hand, employment creation and flexibility with employment protection and security on the other.  Thus, trade unions&rsquo; fears are that temporary workers would suffer lower pay and benefits than regular workers.  Employers contest this and point to the value of temporary work to certain groups in society and to the potential benefits which temporary work and agency work provide as a stepping stone to employment for certain persons as well as the competitive advantages offered to employers.  The above forms the background and situates the debate and discussions on the proposed EU directive on temporary agency work.</P>
        <P>In the context of these European Union negotiations on the proposed directive, Ireland will continue to adopt a constructive approach in these discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Obstructive.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="575"/>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>However, Ireland considers that the proposal for consideration, as currently drafted, is somewhat unbalanced.  We have concerns about exemptions, or derogations, which would be to the benefit or advantage of some member states and not others.  The European Foundation&rsquo;s recent report on EU temporary agency working confirms that, in those member states where equal pay legislation is complemented by collective agreements, deviation from the equal pay clause in legislation may be permitted.  In this regard, Ireland has, with other member states, indicated that if permanent derogations through collective agreements are to be allowed, then other means providing for derogations should also be allowed in those member states without legally enforceable collective agreements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In particular, Ireland considers that the proposed six-week maximum derogation from equal treatment provided for in the draft directive in respect of short duration temporary agency assignments is too short.  This is particularly so in comparison to the derogation available to those member states with collective agreements which can and do deviate from equal treatment in pay levels and in the areas of wider working and employment conditions.  Deputy Penrose referred to many countries that have collective agreements which deviate from pay parity.  This should be borne in mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>We should support the EU directive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The shorter period on offer could damage future job creation prospects and could deter the legitimate use of temporary agency working which would be to the detriment of our economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody is against that. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>This is particularly the case as agency work can provide, in certain circumstances, a useful stepping stone for some persons to enter the labour market.  The opportunities available to agency workers in Ireland should not be reduced as a result of any new arrangements.  Any directive in this area ideally would provide a balance between, on the one hand, employment creation and flexibility and employment protection and security on the other.  The Government will continue to adopt a constructive approach to these discussions at EU level.</P>
        <P>Ireland supports the three objectives that the original proposal sought to address &mdash; to protect temporary workers; to recognise that temporary employment agencies exercise a legitimate role in the labour market and provide a suitable framework for the creation of jobs; and to review prohibitions and remove unwarranted restrictions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>What about pay?  Is pay included in the directive?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>At the very least, provision might be made to take account of the tradition of social dialogue which applies in various countries, including Ireland, as recognised in the arrangements for national reform partnerships in the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.  In this way, the different traditions and practices at national level can be fully recognised and respected.</P>
        <P>The Portuguese Presidency considered that there would be added value in working on a simultaneous and integrated solution on two sensitive dossiers, the temporary agency work directive and the organisation of working time directive, given previous difficulties in finding solutions on each legislative proposal in isolation.  In the event, however, the Portuguese Presi<Col N="576"/>dency was unable to progress these dossiers to a successful conclusion at Council and concluded that the best option was to postpone a final decision on these matters.</P>
        <P>This decision had regard to the nature of the discussion at Council on these proposals, to the range of outstanding difficulties and to the clear desire of member states to reach a consensus rather than seek to push matters to a divisive and perhaps damaging vote.  The outcome is disappointing given the history of these two dossiers and the hopes raised in advance of our discussions.</P>
        <P>We adopted a consistent and constructive approach in the discussions at Council.  We fully supported the Portuguese Presidency in its efforts to fashion an overall compromise solution by way of an integrated approach to these two sensitive dossiers, for the benefit of all EU member states.  As regards the proposed directive on the organisation of working time, the proposal from the Portuguese Presidency represented a significant effort at finding a compromise solution and one which Ireland could support.</P>
        <P>On the proposed directive on temporary agency work, I was clear and unequivocal in explaining our position at Council when I indicated that we fully supported the thrust of the objectives of the proposed directive.  I also indicated that any such instrument must be balanced and be to the benefit of all parties concerned &mdash; employees and enterprises alike.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State did not support it on pay. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Deputy that I was the one in the room, not him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the report of the permanent representation which says otherwise. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I informed my ministerial colleagues, however, that I was concerned that the latest proposals on the table did not contain all the necessary elements of balance.  Thus, permitted exemptions provided for in the proposed directive would be to the advantage, or benefit, of some member states and not others.  This would be the case for those member states where equal pay legislation is complemented by collective agreements and where deviation from the equal pay clause in legislation may be permitted.  This would not work for member states with different legal and industrial relations frameworks.</P>
        <P>I indicated to Ministers that Ireland considered that the exemption proposed for short duration temporary agency assignments was too short and did not provide the required flexibility.  It could damage future job creation prospects and deter the use of a legitimate form of employment, which would be to the detriment of our economy and agency workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That explains why the Government objected to it for the past five years. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Minister of State&rsquo;s excuse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Regrettably, having identified the remaining issues of concern to various member states, the Presidency decided not to pursue the search for a solution at the Council.  Ireland was fully prepared to assist in trying to resolve outstanding issues at the Council rather than postpone addressing these.</P>
        <P>In its Council declaration, the Portuguese Presidency urged forthcoming presidencies, together with the European Commission, to proceed with efforts to achieve a positive and final <Col N="577"/>outcome on both directives, based on the integrated approach, which received positive support as a way forward.</P>

	<P>This represents the best means of obtaining the necessary overall balance in Community legal instruments of this nature.  The Government will continue to be constructive in its approach to further negotiations on these two legislative instruments.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the Government&rsquo;s position on the proposed EU directive has been consistent with its commitments under social partnership and I look forward to the discussions in this House of the forthcoming legislation on regulation of employment agencies.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to discuss issues raised in the motion and the Government amendment and the improvements the Government has made, and is preparing, to improve the protection framework for workers.  We have made considerable improvements over the past decade, many of them geared towards addressing new challenges in the labour market in a changing world of work and working relationships.</P>
        <P>New forms of employment have posed new challenges for Governments in Ireland and across the globe.  For decades we have tried to build up a high-quality social protection framework, with clearly defined relationships and responsibilities for workers and their employers.  This framework contains transparent and easily accessible routes for redress when there has been a breakdown in employment relationships.</P>
        <P>Some of the areas of concern to be addressed in the course of this evening&rsquo;s debate are also being addressed in other EU member states, some of which are now considering whether to introduce a minimum wage.  The minimum wage was introduced in Ireland in April 2000 and is the second highest in Europe.  We are often berated for having a high minimum wage and it is regrettable that in debates such as this our substantial progress on workers&rsquo; rights is not acknowledged.  If it was, the debate would be more balanced and there would be less of the rhetoric that comes to dominate debates of this kind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are concerned that the minimum wage will become the only wage. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

	<P>Germany is contemplating introducing it on a sectoral basis.  That is an issue on which we can hold our heads up and it gives lie to the presentation that this Government ignores the rights of workers on the lower end of the pay scale or that it wilfully tolerates the widespread abuse and neglect of workers.  That is simply not the case and it should not be used as an argument in this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has participated in recent years in discussions in international organisations, such as the International Labour Organisation, to clarify employment relationships in a rapidly changing and mobile world.  These discussions have focused on difficulties in identifying employers in certain circumstances and in addressing so-called triangular relationships, involving an employee, an agency and an end-user company.</P>
        <P>While Irish legislation tries to reflect and deal with current realities, there is always a need to step back and consider if improvements are possible without becoming so rigidly bureaucratic as to damage employment prospects, especially for those attempting to get into employment for the first time or after a period out of the labour market.</P>
     
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I make no apology for stating that this debate is in the context of both employment policy and employment creation policy and there must be balance in respect of how to make progress on this issue.  Members should not become overly complacent in respect of employment creation in the economy.  While we have enjoyed a great decade during which our employment creation record was superior to that of almost all our European counterparts, that is no reason to set everything aside as we contemplate new policies and approaches and deal with new challenges.  There must be a balance of approach when trying to get it right.  That is the point outlined by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher.  It is about the balance and how we approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no balance at present.  The position is skewed in respect of agency workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;getting the right model in the end.</P>
        <P>In considering issues in respect of employment agencies, one should bear in mind that a number of them offer a wide range of services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe Deputy Morgan has accepted that some provide what is primarily a matching service, whereby they provide an introductory service between employees and employers, with the cost to be paid by the employer, not the employee.  Others provide a service by deploying their own employees, sometimes from overseas, to an end-user company whereby the agency remains the employer with legal liability for the application of Irish employment legislation to those workers.  Many agencies supply both types of services.</P>
        <P>The placement function performed by an employment agency tends not to be a cause for complaint in respect of compliance with employment rights.  In such cases there is not much room for confusion as to roles and responsibilities.  However, I accept there is a greater capacity for lack of clarity regarding legal relationships and related responsibilities when agencies deploy their own personnel to work for a limited period to an end-user company.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the point made by the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, that agency workers comprise approximately 2% of the workforce.  That percentage in no way understates that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister publish the figures in this respect?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="579"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures to which I have just alluded are Central Statistics Office figures from 2005.  Members may be aware that the Central Statistics Office has included a number of questions about agency workers in the current module of the quarterly national household survey and the results will be available in May.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>It is taking a long time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>This will give all the social partners a better picture in respect of how many persons are employed by agencies, the sectors in which they are active, where they are from and whether the practice of agency working is growing.</P>
        <P>The phenomenon of agency working is not new and has been a key feature of sectors such as nursing for many years where the availability of agency personnel has provided an element of much-needed flexibility.  This phenomenon has also been witnessed in the broad information technology sector in recent years.  Workers in these sectors in general are relatively well paid and are highly mobile.  Agency working suits their lifestyle and allows the flexibility of which they wish to avail.  I experienced this phenomenon as Minister for Health and Children for many years whereby people left almost permanent employment and opted for the agency route because it suited their individual needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Members accept that.  They know about flexibility but they want to hear about security.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government accepts fully that this is not always the case in respect of other sectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister refers to flexibility, but what about security?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate that agency workers, regardless of nationality, together with workers posted by their employer from overseas to work temporarily in Ireland have the same rights under Irish employment rights legislation as Irish employees.  Workers in the categories mentioned also are able to take complaints to the labour inspectorate and to have their cases heard by the State&rsquo;s dispute resolution machinery, as represented by bodies such as the rights commissioner service, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It is important that this framework for investigation and dispute resolution, which has won broad public acceptance and support over the years, is used effectively.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the point made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, that Members who have specific complaints should bring them to the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, when they receive them and not before or after that debate.  They should pass them on immediately to the National Employment Rights Authority.  I contacted the authority again this afternoon which, together with the Employment Appeals Tribunal, stated that agency working<i> per se</i> as a sector does not feature to the degree about which one hears&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not arguing with Members, I simply make the point that Members should go to the agencies that are charged with responsibility for enforcing and achieving compliance with Irish labour law.  They want to acquire such specific information to pursue such matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The practices are legal at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There appears to be a general impression that agency workers are mainly from overseas and are mainly poorly paid.  One of the problems in addressing issues that arise in this area is the lack of hard data.  I trust the work being undertaken by the CSO will help to inform and clarify some of the issues in this respect.  It is too broad a generalisation to equate agency workers with migrant workers.  This society and economy are becoming more complex.  Nevertheless, the unprecedented expansion of the economy over the past decade clearly has provided opportunities for exploitation, particularly in the case of those newly arrived in the country who are not aware of their very extensive employment rights.  Combating such abuses requires action from Government agencies, which will be forthcoming, and other representative groups in broader society.</P>
        <P>We must move with clarity of purpose and resolution to use effectively the considerable resources now available to avoid and combat such exploitation.  The Government does not and will never accept exploitation of workers.  It will always work to eradicate and eliminate exploitation and to penalise and punish those who perpetrate such acts.  It has demonstrated this through the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority in consort with the social partners.</P>
        <P>However, it also must be recognised that the capacity to source agency workers on a flexible basis is of considerable value to enterprises in a competitive economic environment and to the foreign direct investment sector.  When setting up the National Employment Rights Authority, the Government made a highly significant additional investment in the areas of promoting compliance with employment law and in ensuring that in the event of non-compliance there are effective mechanisms for redress and, where appropriate, prosecution.  I again ask Members to make available any information or knowledge they may have to those working in this field.</P>
        <P>It must be acknowledged that in the integrated global economy which has been evolving in recent years, the availability of flexibility in production and service chains has played a lead role in enabling successful enterprises to respond quickly to consumer demand.  It has become vital to respond quickly, for example, to seasonal peaks in demand.  This ability to respond quickly and flexibly has also become a key feature when companies investing overseas are trying to assess which locations offer the most promising environment for direct investment.  Flexible labour markets are important.  If one opts for too much rigidity, it could be at the risk of undermining one&rsquo;s job creation capacity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is undermining it through its stealth taxes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>When Ireland was a relatively low-cost environment in manufacturing, we were quite successful in attracting investment at that end of the mobile investment market.  However, as the world changed, we were obliged to adapt and develop other points of competitive advantage in the newer international economy and to move up the value chain.  A key selling point in the armoury of IDA Ireland has been the evidence that Ireland&rsquo;s work <Col N="581"/>practices are flexible while still reflecting the broad social protection to workers embodied in European Union employment legislation.</P>
        <P>Generally, companies in the foreign direct investment sector tend to pay employees well and broader conditions of employment are also attractive.  More than 1,000 such companies in the country employ more than 136,000 people in total and more than 50% of the workers concerned have salaries of more than &euro;40,000 per annum.  A considerable number of companies in this sector are clear that they need a stable operating environment in which rules and obligations are transparent and predictable.</P>
        <P>However, my continuing contacts with this sector have made it clear that the importance of continued flexibility in the labour market to the sector should not be underestimated.  Deputies will have seen how some of the larger EU member states lost competitiveness and labour market flexibility in periods of expansion that looked as though they would never end.  However, they ended and it has proved extremely difficult for those member states to regain the lost labour market flexibility as those in secure employment are reluctant to agree changes aimed at assisting those in precarious employment or those who are out of work.  This has been a feature of other economies.  The key challenge in this respect is to find the appropriate balance at any given point in a society&rsquo;s development.  In making decisions in the short term, one must bear in mind their long-term consequences.</P>
        <P>The Government supports the concept of equal treatment in the area of employment relationships and its record in negotiating and agreeing an appropriate legislative framework to this end is solid.  There is no question of employers being able to use the flexibility associated with agency working as a means of avoiding what are accepted as normal obligations in an employer-employee relationship. However, there is a very valid argument regarding both the content of what might constitute equal treatment and the period of employment after which it should become mandatory.  While the draft EU directive provides for the effective protection of derogations regarding equal treatment negotiated at social partnership level in various member states, as drafted at present, the balance was not in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s national needs or perspective.  As an aside, Ireland cannot block an EU directive on its own.  It is a physical and numerical impossibility.</P>

	<P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I welcome the Sinn F&eacute;in-Labour motion, which is timely, has real merit and proposes some valid solutions to the problems that exist.  It clearly exposes the Government&rsquo;s failure to honour the commitments it made in the partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  Consequently, Fine Gael will be opposing the Government&rsquo;s amendment and supporting the motion.  We have one or two reservations, which I will outline later in my contribution.</P>
        <P>Research has shown that agency workers are at a major disadvantage compared to directly employed workers in a number of ways.  Research conducted in the United Kingdom shows that agencies are paid 68% less, on average, than directly employed staff in similar jobs.  They have fewer entitlements and suffer from higher levels of workplace injury across Europe.</P>
        <P>In the past, agency work tended to be associated with temporary positions, such as those that arose on foot of maternity leave or unplanned vacancies.  In many cases, agency workers tended to be students or workers in the home who were not in full-time employment.  Agency work provided flexibility for both workers and employees but the nature of such work has changed significantly in recent years, thereby giving rise to the problems we face today.</P>
        <P>In the United Kingdom it is estimated that the percentage of agency workers has increased from 2.6% in 2002 to 5% in 2006.  In Ireland, it is estimated that there are approximately 27,000 to 30,000 temporary agency workers.  It is likely that this figure is significantly underestimated and it will therefore be interesting to see the results of the quarterly household survey when the question on agency work is included.</P>
        <P>Agency work is commonplace in a number of sectors, including construction, retail and hospitality, and food processing in particular.  There is no question but that the expansion of agency work has led to a deterioration in conditions and a decrease in pay.  In some cases, although not as many as one might be led to believe, it has led to the displacement of directly employed permanent staff.  It will be interesting to see what terms and conditions will apply to the employees of Arnotts when it reopens after its redevelopment.  When the Burlington Hotel and some other hotels were reopened, it is clear that agency workers replaced the directly employed permanent workforce and were hired under what most would consider to be inferior terms and conditions.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael agrees fully with the introduction of legislation to regulate employment agencies properly.  This should be the key to this debate.  The Employment Agency Act 1971 is clearly insufficient and I understand there have only been approximately 50 inspections of agencies in the past three to four years.  This is entirely inadequate.  The new legislation has yet to be published.  It is indicated in the legislative programme that it is to be published this session, but the session, which has only three weeks remaining, is drawing to a close rapidly.  I certainly hope we will see the legislation by the end of the month, as the Taoiseach promised, or, if not, at least before St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, as the Whip promised.  The new legislation should make provision for a new licensing system, a proper code of practice, proper enforcement and, crucially, a requirement that employment agencies be underpinned financially.  The latter is not the case at present and this should be of concern to everyone.</P>
        <P>We are concerned about agencies that tie their employees to their work in unusual ways, including agencies that provide transport for their employees to and from work, agencies that <Col N="583"/>provide accommodation and expect their employees to use it, or agencies that deduct the cost of accommodation and transport from their workers&rsquo; pay.  Where this occurs, the conditions are worryingly close to those that exist in countries such as China, where employees are expected to live, eat and spend their lives within the factory compound.</P>
        <P>While I accept that many agency workers are not immigrants, it is not a coincidence that the countries that have been least enthusiastic in the protection of the rights of agency workers, namely, the United Kingdom and Ireland, are those that have had a significant increase in immigration.</P>
        <P>As some Deputies stated, there is no evidence that properly regulated employment agencies or reasonable protection for agency workers has a negative effect on competitiveness or labour market flexibility.  The labour markets in The Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden are among the most competitive in Europe and those countries enjoy much higher labour force participation than Ireland, even if one allows for the fact that they have many more women with children in their workforces.  The countries have greater protections than are afforded in Ireland.  It is open to question as to whether Denmark and Sweden have enshrined the principle of equal treatment in law.  It might be appropriate to say they have not but that is a technical point.</P>
        <P>The key point to this debate should concern the regulation of agencies and the enforcement of existing laws, which is very poor.  Enforcement would achieve much more than any new domestic legislation or EU directive.  A very useful booklet produced by SIPTU points out that there are approximately 17 legislative measures applying to agency workers.  Therefore, there are extensive protections for agency workers but the reality is that many of them are not aware, or made aware, of their rights.  In many cases, the rights are not respected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The applicable Acts include the Adoptive Leave Act, the Carer&rsquo;s Leave Act, the Employment Agency Act, the Employment Equality Act, the Industrial Relations Act, the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, the National Minimum Wage Act, the Organisation of Working Time Act, the Parental Leave Act, the Payment of Wages Act, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, the Protection of Employment Act, the Redundancy Payments Acts, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, the Terms of Employment (Information) Acts and the Unfair Dismissals Acts.</P>
        <P>If we regulate agencies properly and ensure they are reputable, and ensure agency workers are aware of their rights, we will probably achieve more than we would with new legislation or EU directives.</P>
        <P>It is fair to state that any reasonable person would support the principle of equal treatment, but the key issue concerns its definition, application and the timing of its application.  It is important to recognise that employees should receive additional benefits and just remuneration with time and service.  The package of terms and conditions an employer agrees with permanent employees should be reflective of the ongoing commitment that the employer is entitled to assume on the part of those employees who have made a long-term commitment to that employer.  As there is no expectation or entitlement of such an ongoing commitment from agency workers or temporary workers, it seems reasonable that an automatic right should not apply.  What should apply is a period after which the same rights should be enforced.  Where a genuine temporary vacancy arises in an office, it is not unreasonable to afford better pay, conditions and pension rights to the person who normally holds the position and wants to retain it after his or her temporary absence than to the person who is employed temporarily.  The difficulty arises where temporary positions actually become long term and the agency employee is occupying what should be a permanent position.</P><Col N="584"/>
        <P Just="Left">Probably uniquely among Members of this House, I, as a medical doctor, am signed up with an employment agency.  I receive texts all the time asking me whether I want to do a weekend shift in Crumlin Hospital, for example.  Every now and again, &euro;1,000 is suggested as the pay and I do not feel too exploited by it.  I know many nurses, as opposed to nurses&rsquo; aides or care assistants, who have left their jobs to take up agency work because the pay is much better.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="5" />
        <P>In many ways the best argument to be made for better pay for nurses is that the free market, which operates through the agencies, shows that nurses should be paid much more because they are paid more as agency workers than they would be paid if they were employees of the HSE.</P>
        <P>We join Sinn F&eacute;in and Labour Party Members in condemning the Government&rsquo;s failure to honour the commitments it made under Towards 2016.  We call on the Government to immediately introduce legislation to regulate employment agencies, to introduce domestic legislation allowing agency employees to be covered by registered employment agreements, REAs, and, crucially, to properly enforce existing laws.  We also affirm our support for a common EU directive that would protect agency workers while ensuring competitiveness and crucial to such a directive must be the setting of a reasonable time limit after which agency work becomes permanent work.</P>

	<P>This is an important debate.  I recognise and am supportive of the need for flexibility in the workplace and the need to ensure employers are free to bring in workers on the basis of need, whether it be to meet a seasonal demand or satisfy customer demand.  Nobody doubts the need for that flexibility in the marketplace.  However, some agency workers are being exploited, of that there is no doubt.  We hear much anecdotal evidence of that.  I read recently in the media of the position of workers in Irish Ferries, although that is not directly related to employment in this country.  The position of the Gama workers was another example of such exploitation.  I accept what the Minister said regarding the National Employment Rights Authority and I have spoken to those in the authority.  If employees have concerns and issues need to be brought to the authority&rsquo;s attention, that should be done.  When the authority expands its inspectorate to the promised 90, hopefully, it will be more effective. </P>
        <P>When I began work, agency or contract workers were better paid than permanent workers because they took a risk.  They did not have holiday leave built into their pay nor did they have security of employment.  In the case of some agency workers, the position has reversed.  I agree with what Deputy Varadkar said about the many nurses who have left the HSE because they can get better terms and conditions through the agencies.  Other health professionals have also left the public health system.  In the construction industry many architects, engineers and quantity surveyors have also moved to agency work.  It is those with low skills, the unskilled and primarily migrant workers who are being exploited; they are being offered accommodation by employment agencies.  They are not fully aware of their rights, perhaps because they have moved to another country and have a difficulty with the language.  That is the area on which we need to concentrate.</P>
        <P>As to the number of people concerned, I heard many figures mentioned tonight and I read in SIPTU&rsquo;s documentation that probably 30,000 workers are employed in the Republic of Ireland through 520 employment agencies.  I am not saying all those agencies are exploiting workers but it is an area on which we need to concentrate and we need to introduce legislation to regulate employment agencies.  There has been a proliferation of such agencies recently and <Col N="585"/>coming from behind in terms of the need to regulate is a dangerous position.  We need to be more proactive in that regard.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the introduction of Government&rsquo;s legislation in this area and to another debate on this matter when hopefully I will have more time to contribute.  When one reads the background to position of workers in Irish Ferries, who allegedly are paid &euro;4 an hour, confined to the ship at all times and employed by an agency that is registered in Cyprus, no one can condone those conditions.  We have a minimum wage and legislation in place to protect workers&rsquo; rights but not everybody is protected by it.  The emphasis in the approach should be on the regulation of agencies and the work time and contract time for which employees can be engaged.  Many issues were raised by Members and I join my colleagues in supporting the motion.  It is timely, important and there is much concern about this issue.  I hope the Government will move to introduce the necessary legislation in this area.</P>

	<P>Taking Longford-Westhmeath as a microcosm of the country, it is in no way surprising that as Ireland&rsquo;s economic competitiveness has fallen 17 points since the Minister, Deputy Martin, who has just left the Chamber, came to office, the standardised unemployment rate now stands at 4.9% countrywide, the highest level in seven years and is predicted to rise to a nine year high by the end of this year.  Speaking from the perspective of coming from a rural constituency, the direct impact on jobs is most keenly felt in the construction and farming sectors, with farmers being driven out of industry at an unprecedented rate.  During recent years Longford-Westmeath has seen overall job losses of almost 150 people at the Lakeland Group, which followed a direct result of the Government&rsquo;s failure to maintain adequate price structure for our farmers.  A similar position pertained in respect of Glanbia in Rooskey.  We also saw cattle markets in Edgeworthstown, Mullingar and Moate and other enterprises close and several other enterprises threatened in the midlands area.</P>
        <P>Every day in Ireland six farmers leave the land, driven out through excessive bureaucracy and red tape imposed by the Government.  There are also the stealth taxes and the failure of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to provide guaranteed markets for what they produce.  The EU&rsquo;s intervention recently forced the Minister to finally ban Brazilian beef in light of the incidence of foot and mouth disease and lack of traceability of animals.  This had serious repercussions on the farming industry and on jobs here.  The way the Minister behaved had a serious impact on jobs in a meat plant in Ballymahon in my county council electoral area.</P>
        <P>To increase employment opportunities in the farming sector and to retain workers on the land, the Government must provide the best possible educational opportunities for young farmers as this is the key to giving Irish agriculture a competitive edge.  The midland counties are starved of infrastructural investment with a shameful and inexplicable underspend in the BMW funding.  Strangely this money finds it way back into the Exchequer each year and the Government fails year in year out to meet its obligations to provide essential infrastructure for the development of our country.</P>
        <P>Longford-Westmeath, although perfectly situated in the centre of the country with equal access to the east and the west, is losing out on major international investment due to the state of its infrastructure to the detriment of economic development.  The counties are getting less than their fair share of State-assisted jobs &mdash; it is less than 3%.  Employment can be created in this constituency by attracting new industry to Longford-Westmeath, creating off-farm and rural employment opportunities and the provision of additional funding to encourage our indigenous industries, advancing the decentralisation programme, which was promised with great fanfare a number of years ago.  Fewer than 1,800 jobs have been delivered.  We have in no way met our targets with regard to the 53 locations where decentralisation was promised.</P><Col N="586"/>
        <P>During the Celtic tiger years thousands of untrained workers were drawn into the construction industry, but their future has been dismissed by a Government faced with repercussions of its shameful mismanagement of the economy.  Some 93,000 houses were built in 2006 and that number was halved with only 46,000 built this year, as the big freeze in the economy begins to hit home.  The most vulnerable group in the construction sector are the estimated 30,000 F&Aacute;S supported apprentices in the construction-related trades, particularly those in the so-called &ldquo;wet&rdquo; trades such as painters, bricklayers, plumbers, carpenters and plasterers who are highly vulnerable to the housing downturn.</P>
        <P>The Government lacks an industrial strategy of lower taxes and high skills.  It deserves to be strongly criticised in this regard.  I compliment the Labour Party on tabling this motion.  Any sensible member of the Opposition, not the hypocritical ones who were here last week, would support this motion.  It gives me pleasure to do so.</P>

	<P>The service provided by Familiscope, an organisation set up in 2004 in Ballyfermot to specifically address the psychological needs of the community, is at risk.  It received the backing in particular of the Ballyfermot drugs task force because the issue at hand was identified as an area which needed immediate support and redress.  Ballyfermot has suffered from a lack of investment by the HSE in speech and language therapy and intervention programmes.  Familiscope got the support of the community, the local schools and also the drugs task force to specifically identify children at risk or who might face difficulties in the future and to prevent children and young people from developing behavioural, emotional and communication difficulties as well as psychological and relationship problems, some of which might stem from speech impediments or language difficulties. </P>
        <P>It identified a model and had the support of everyone.  This model had been quite successful in the past year and a half in which it has been operating.  More than 100 children have been assessed and have benefited from early intervention.  There is a backlog of children awaiting speech and language assessments through the normal health clinics system of the HSE, whereas Familiscope works with and in the schools to identify problems and to give some type of hope to the children affected.  The HSE&rsquo;s response to this success is a terrible indictment of that body.  It has cut Familiscope&rsquo;s funding by nearly one third, an absolute scandal.  The impact of that cut will mean the service, which could continue throughout the summer months when the schools are on holidays, will have to be suspended.</P>
        <P>The problem, as anyone who knows anything about children with speech difficulties must realise, is that such intervention needs to be continuously available.  If the therapy is broken, there is a danger that children will revert to where they were before.  Indeed, they might not come back again and disengage altogether.   The break in routine is the major challenge.  For the sake of a measly &euro;24,000, the HSE will endanger the future of 100 children as well as those waiting to access the service.  Parents, teachers and everyone who has assessed Familiscope, including the HSE, have said this is a brilliant service and a model that should be replicated elsewhere, yet the response is that its funding is to be cut.</P><Col N="587"/>
        <P>I urge the Minister to intervene at this stage and tell the HSE to find the money elsewhere &mdash; to ensure that not only are the cutbacks reversed, but that any additional funds needed for the service are available forthwith.  It should ensure that this programme is replicated in other areas where there are children on waiting lists for speech and language services.</P>

	<P>I will be taking the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to respond to this matter. </P>
        <P>I understand that Familiscope was established in Ballyfermot in 2004 as a result of three local development agencies prioritising emotional and behavioural supports as part of their various work goals.  These organisations are the local drugs task force, Ballyfermot Partnership and Urban.  Familiscope now exists to work with children, young people, families and groups in the Ballyfermot community who may experience emotional, behavioural, communication or relationship issues.</P>
        <P>Familiscope provides a number of valuable services and programmes within the Ballyfermot community.  I understand these programmes are funded from a number of different sources, including the Health Service Executive, the Ballyfermot drugs task force, the NDP and Dublin City Council.</P>
        <P>The Incredible Years and speech and language programmes referred to by the Deputy are currently funded by the Health Service Executive.  I understand from the HSE that in 2007 the local health office Dublin west funded Familiscope to the tune of approximately &euro;124,100.  The breakdown of this was &euro;87,800 for speech and language therapy services and &euro;36,300 for implementation of the Incredible Years programme for the Ballyfermot area.  Familiscope was informed when the amount of grant was decided that the matter of further funding in 2008 would be reviewed during 2007.  This review was carried out in 2007 and, in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s financial situation, the grant was reduced to &euro;102,000 for 2008.  However, this funding is for 2008 and will not cease until December 2008.  I understand from the HSE that Familiscope was informed of this by letter dated 19 December 2007.</P>
        <P>I am informed that as the local health office, Dublin west, is obliged to stay within budget, Familiscope has been informed that unless a budget is approved for it during 2008, funding will cease.  The local office is of the view that it was important to inform Familiscope as early as possible about potential difficulties in order that it can seek alternative sources of funding.</P>
        <P>Under the dormant accounts scheme, funding has been ring-fenced to support priority projects in RAPID areas.  It is understood that an application on behalf of the group concerned and for this specific project has been submitted by the Ballyfermot RAPID area implementation team and a decision in respect of this application is expected shortly.</P>
        <P>I want to take the opportunity to outline recent developments in the area of therapy services in the context of the national disability strategy.  In launching the strategy, the Taoiseach announced the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a multi-annual investment for disability specific services over a five year period.  To the end of 2007, &euro;420 million &mdash; revenue and capital &mdash; has been allocated to services for people with disabilities since the launch of the strategy in 2004.  Additional revenue funding of &euro;50 million was provided in the 2008 budget in respect of the multi-annual investment package.  This funding, which was given in the budget, is to meet the costs associated with a range of elements in the multi-annual investment programme.This additional funding will continue to provide a baseline to considerably enhance the multi-disciplinary support services for people with disabilities in line with the Government&rsquo;s commit<Col N="588"/>ment to build capacity within the health services and to deliver on the various legislative provisions contained in the national disability strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Demand for speech and language therapy in the health services is very significant, hence the substantial investment which has been provided in recent years.  The number of speech and language therapists employed in the public health service has grown from 281 whole-time equivalents in 1997 to 712 whole-time equivalents at the end December 2007 - a 153% growth in that period.</P>
        <P>A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates, including speech and language therapists.  Additional courses in speech and language therapy were established in three universities. UCC, NUIG and UL each established courses in speech and language therapy with an initial intake of 25 places on each of the three courses.</P>
        <P>The UL course is at masters level and the first cohorts graduated in 2005.  The first cohort from the bachelor degree programmes in UCC and NUIG graduated last year.  This investment represents an increase in training capacity of 300% in speech and language therapy.  The latest information available to my Department indicates that the total number of speech and language therapy training places now stands at 109.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  Earlier last year when it became evident that we would not have a ferry service between Cork and Swansea, little did we realise the important economic artery which had been severed.  The dismal 2007 season cannot be blamed entirely on the weather as people pre-booked their holidays.  A noticeable drop in tourism figures has been witnessed throughout the west Cork region.  My research indicates a drop in revenue of approximately 30% across the board.  Little did we realise what was to be lost to us.  The Minister of the day with responsibility for tourism stated that the loss of the Cork-Swansea ferry service would have a minimal impact on tourism in the city and in west Cork.  It is now crystal clear that the loss of our ferry service is similar to and on a par with the loss of the Heathrow slots to Shannon, when Aer Lingus pulled out.  With uncertainty looming over Cork Airport, it is of paramount importance that the ferry service is restored at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>I recently heard the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment state on the radio that perhaps the city corporation and county council should contribute to new ferry proposals.  I take this opportunity to inform the Minister that the ratepayers of the county and city of Cork are pushed to their limit with rates, coupled with the cost of their services, and any monetary intervention would have to come from Government.</P>
        <P>Recent research shows that Ireland is now the third most popular holiday destination for the British public.  In areas throughout west Cork which are not serviced by rail or bus, the ferry service was a lifeline for the many hotels, guest houses, bars, restaurants and seasonal businesses, such as boating services, pony trekking etc.  A very large influx of golfers came from the west midlands, Wales and the south of England, and Europeans also used the service.  With the demise of the service, it is alarming to find a fall-off in this type of business, which in the case of British visitors amounts to a drop of 51% in one west Cork golf club alone and an overall loss to the south-west region of at least &euro;35 million.</P>
        <P>It is my contention that the impact has been anything but minimal.  Figures at my disposal indicate that for almost three years of its existence, the ferry carried 285,250 passengers to the area, bringing with them 108,459 cars.  These are real figures which show the loss to the region, <Col N="589"/>with peninsulas such as Beara, Muintir na Mara and the Mizen, with the associated towns and hinterlands becoming increasingly more dependent on tourism for survival.  The lost revenue of these and the adjoining regions, if allowed to continue, has a lethal effect on the economic sustainability and viability of these proud communities which continuously battle on a daily basis for their existence.  Lost revenue from this lucrative market has to be recaptured as soon as possible.  There are talks and rumours abounding at present that others are in the process of providing a service but, as one correspondent recently stated, these are only phantom ships, and as we all know, phantom ships will bring phantom people with phantom money, which will not pay the piper at the end of the day.</P>
        <P>The Minister cannot stand idly by and watch our main industries in the peripheral area of our county disintegrate before our eyes.  We have no rail service in south-west Cork, no roll-on roll-off service in the area, no bus service to the peripheral areas of our three peninsulas and not one mile of national primary route in the Cork south-west region.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State expect our inhabitants to survive on fresh air and cold water?  At least, the Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, has subsidised ferry services to all the islands off our regions.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility for the Minister for Transport to subsidise a ferry service to aid the beleaguered tourist industry in south-west Cork.  If the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, can do it for the islands, surely the Government can do it for the south-west Cork region.</P>
        <P>We now have no facilities to bring tourists into our region.  Proper infrastructure is the key to a successful tourist business in that area.  Every citizen in this country should be equally cherished, according to our Constitution.  Actions speak louder than words.  We have only three natural industries &mdash; agriculture, fisheries and tourism &mdash; and the first two are bedevilled by a quota system and the red tape of bureaucracy.  Tourism has no quota.  I ask the Minister to help to restore the industry and act before it is too late.  The Cork-Swansea ferry service must be restored.  It is of paramount importance to the area.  No area in the country should be abandoned by the Government the way the south-west region has been abandoned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  I thank Deputy Sheehan for raising this issue.</P>
        <P>The Cork Swansea Ferries Company suspended its service in 2007.  The Minister for Transport appreciates the concerns that have been expressed in the region in response to this development.  The Minister understands that a number of interested parties and stakeholders have been in discussions with the Port of Cork Company about the possibility of commencing a new passenger and freight service out of the port.  The Minister is also informed that a commercial examination of the route has been carried out which indicates that, subject to procuring a suitable vessel, the service could be feasible on a year-round basis.  The Port of Cork Company will certainly do what it can to facilitate the resumption of the service.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport is of the view that it is important that the market should offer a diverse range of maritime links both into and out of the State.  That is vital to facilitating trade and tourism.  It is hoped that the current efforts show that the service is commercially viable and that it can be resumed as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I will outline other recent developments in the maritime sector.  The Minister for Transport has responsibility for national ports policy which provides a framework for the provision of commercial port infrastructure and services that are efficient, effective and adequate for the needs of our trading economy.  In addition, the Minister for Transport is the primary shareholder in the ten State-owned port companies, including the Port of Cork Company.  However, he has no role in the day-to-day operational matters of the company.</P><Col N="590"/>
        <P>The principal objectives of the Port of Cork Company are to take all proper measures for the management, control, operation and development of its harbour.  Current policy is to require the ports to operate commercially, without Exchequer support and to provide adequate in-time capacity for the future needs of the economy.  The Port of Cork Company has a number of projects under development to significantly increase and improve the port facilities it has to offer within Cork harbour.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport also has responsibility for policy in regard to the shipping and maritime commerce sectors, which are the largest direct employers in the Irish maritime economy.  The Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, is the shipping sector&rsquo;s statutory, dedicated development and promotional agency.  The Government has introduced a number of fiscal and strategic policy measures that have had significant positive impacts on the sector.  Government policy to promote the shipping sector concentrates on fiscal areas, marketing and education.</P>
        <P>As regards fiscal reliefs, a range of beneficial fiscal reliefs, with EU state aid approval, is in place for the shipping sector.  These include a full refund to employers of social insurance contributions relating to seagoing employees, a unique &euro;6,350 income tax allowance for seafarers who are at sea for more than 161 days and a &euro;5,000 tax-free allowance for Irish seafarers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards marketing, the Irish shipping industry is marketed through the Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO.  The IMDO pursues its promotional activities, supported by the Department as appropriate, through direct marketing, including contact through the embassy network and through the holding of information seminars for the industry.</P>
        <P>The Government has also taken a number of initiatives in the area of maritime education.  The &euro;51 million National Maritime College of Ireland opened in autumn 2004 in Ringaskiddy, County Cork.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter in the D&aacute;il tonight.  I am motivated to do so by the information that has come to my attention that the commitment of providing the necessary funding for a local sewerage scheme in Freshford, County Kilkenny, has been put back from 2008 to 2010 under the water services programme.  It is a pity that the people in the area were not made aware of this matter at an event that took place in May 2007, but I suppose that is not unusual in political terms.</P>
        <P>Freshford is an area of 1,500 people and, together with the villages of Johnstown and Goresbridge in County Kilkenny, it has been on the waiting list for a considerable period of time to get a contract to proceed under the water services programme.  It is well located, being a ten-minute drive from Kilkenny city.  It is a very picturesque and beautiful part of County Kilkenny, <Col N="591"/>but it lacks the necessary infrastructure to allow the type of development that has gone on in other villages and towns.  Recently it had a setback with the closure of the local meat factory.  One of the problems that factory had over the years was difficulty in satisfying the local authority about the licensing arrangements for the disposal of sewage arising from the activity of that plant.</P>
        <P>It is an indictment of the local authority and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in particular that the existing sewage treatment plant is no more than a septic tank that allows raw sewage to go into the River Nuenna in the village of Freshford.  That has been the case for a considerable time.  In the past four or five years, despite the best efforts of Kilkenny County Council, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been unable to provide the funds to allow this work to be carried out.  The time has long passed for political promises from the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, who circulated correspondence to everybody before the last general election stating that there would be no difficulty in proceeding with this scheme in 2008.  Now we know the truth that there is a problem with the timing of the funding.</P>
        <P>Every other town and village in the county has had a fair crack of the whip regarding funding for essential services and water and sewerage, but this village seems to have been left behind.  People are having great difficulty getting planning approval for businesses and housing developments in the village.  We should be encouraging those developers and promoters of those projects in this day and age in view of the decline in the level of interest in construction activity.  We should be glad to have people willing to enter into private public partnerships or inject private investment into a place like Freshford to give it the necessary critical mass for the essential services required across the board, including child care and educational facilities.</P>
        <P>I am told the contract price for the bundle of projects is &euro;5.1 million, which is not a lot of money in this day and age.  The preliminary report has been sent to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the past week.  However, like other experiences I have had as Fine Gael spokesman on the environment, it seems to take four or five years for all the toing and froing between local authority and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government before money can be committed.  However, in this case a solemn commitment was given by a Government representative that this project would be delivered in 2008.  I am now told that July 2011 is the completion date for this project.  The people of Freshford are incensed at the delay in the provision of this essential project.  I ask the Minister of State to give us the necessary information that would allow the project to proceed as quickly as possible on behalf of the community of Freshford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the position on this scheme.  I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment Heritage and Local Government.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</P>
        <P>Freshford is part of the Freshford, Johnstown and Goresbridge sewerage scheme which is approved to advance through planning under the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009.  The three locations have been combined under one scheme so that the overall package can be procured under a single contract.  This will optimise the cost of building the infrastructure and will speed up the delivery phase since the same contractor will be involved from design through to completion.</P>
        <P>The scheme is one of 18 water services projects being progressed in County Kilkenny at present with the support of unprecedented Exchequer funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the national development plan.  The current water services programme, which the Minister published in September 2007, provides for <Col N="592"/>an investment of &euro;127 million in water and sewerage infrastructure in County Kilkenny in the next few years.  A copy of the programme is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The range of new water and sewerage works planned and in progress is clear evidence of the Government&rsquo;s determination to safeguard the environment, while at the same time making appropriate provision to secure new development areas across the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The &euro;7.9 million Freshford - Johnstown - Goresbridge scheme involves the expansion and overhaul of the existing wastewater treatment plants in each location, with major upgrading of the sewage collection networks.  The expanded treatment plants will have a combined capacity to cater for a population equivalent of 5,000.  Capacity at the Freshford plant is being increased to deal with a population equivalent of 2,000.  This will ensure that existing needs are fully met and that there is scope to deal with additional demand for future development.</P>
        <P>The preliminary report for the scheme, which sets out the design parameters and objectives, was submitted to the Department by Kilkenny County Council last week.  The Deputy will appreciate that multi-million euro projects that are being funded by the taxpayer must go through the proper planning and development processes to ensure that they meet their intended objectives, that they are designed and constructed in an environmentally acceptable and economical manner and that they produce treated wastewater or drinking water, as the case may be, to a standard that meets national and EU requirements.</P>
        <P>The Department is examining the preliminary report in this case and will respond to the council as soon as possible.  Obviously it is not possible at this early stage to say whether the preliminary report is in order.  However, the objective of the response will be to guide the council on how to advance the scheme through the remaining stages with the least possible delay.  The Department will continue to work closely with Kilkenny County Council to ensure the scheme is delivered as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very thankful for the opportunity to discuss this matter.  I wish to raise on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann the impending closure of all development work at Mountbellew, County Galway, because of a lousy creaking sewerage system that was installed in the 1950s.  As it is my home village, I know what I am talking about.  The final blow for this most progressive small town came when a builder had a substantial housing and commercial project stopped dead in its tracks after Galway County Council had granted it planning permission.  However, it had an unusual twist.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning but inserted a proviso that no work could commence until the upgrade of the sewerage system had been completed.  Several other developments and many single houses will be prevented from starting because of An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>Mountbellew is the worst polluting village, with a population of between 500 and 1,000 inhabitants, in the proposed so-called group development, a term used by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, where a number of other towns and villages need new schemes.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In a report on water quality by the EPA, which has just come into my possession, Mountbellew frequently surpassed almost all other towns and villages in so far as pollution of the nearby River Shiven, a tributary of the River Suck, is concerned.  Many business people in Mountbellew have to put up with a backup of the sewerage system.  In fact, the flow of raw sewage is so bad that, on inspection, it was found that the pipe carrying this foul material simply spews human excrement, washing machine detergents and many other pollutants into what was once a fine trout river, which is alas no more.  A Niagara Falls-type surge of foul material can be seen at the outflow pipe in the river on rainy days when surface water in the town simply races through the only two tanks available to treat sewage. <Col N="593"/> None of this pollution has anything to do with farmers.  As the Minister of State knows, there are almost no farms between Mountbellew Bridge and Canavan&rsquo;s Bridge.  This most foul pollution must be ended immediately.</P>
        <P>According to the EPA&rsquo;s 2005 report on effluent quality from secondary waste water in the Galway County Council area, Mountbellew was worse than Oughterard, Killimor, Portumna, Headford, Loughrea, Moycullen, Gort, Ballinasloe, Athenry and Tuam.  That is from the official record so we can take it that there is a huge pollution problem in Mountbellew.</P>
        <P>In reply to a recent parliamentary question in the D&aacute;il, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, informed me that the Mountbellew sewerage scheme is included in the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2007-09 as a scheme due to start construction in 2008.  If one did not know enough about the system one would think that was good news but that does not appear to be the case at all.  Galway County Council has presented the preliminary detailed file of the scheme to the Department but so far, after several months, there has been no response.  Mountbellew cannot wait for another year.  The Shiven river cannot and should not be expected to turn into a septic tank.  The building projects now lined up for Mountbellew may well be diverted elsewhere.  We need infrastructural developments in our town, which has always attracted high ratings in the Tidy Towns competition.</P>
        <P>Since budget day, Minister after Minister has said that investment in such infrastructural projects now makes greater sense than ever, given the downturn in the economy.  I cannot understand why this action has not been taken.  Will the Minister of State tell us that this scheme will be treated with the urgency it deserves?  Will he ensure that it will be expedited by the Department as quickly as possible because we are dealing with the most polluted area?  The Minister of State knows the area as well as I do so I expect nothing short of a total commitment so that work can begin within the next couple of months.  That was promised to people before the last election but they are now looking for an answer.  They want the project to get under way immediately.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this issue.</P>
        <P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2007-09, which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government published in September 2007, includes more than 50 major water and sewerage schemes, with a value of over &euro;464 million, for County Galway.  The programme includes a further eight schemes with a value of over &euro;114 million for Galway city.</P>
        <P>The Minister is pleased to confirm that the Mountbellew sewerage scheme, at an estimated cost of &euro;5.958 million, is one of the schemes included in the programme.  It is being bundled with sewerage schemes for Carna, Eyrecourt and Kilkieran for procurement purposes and is scheduled for a 2008 start in the investment programme.  Funding has been allocated for the combined package and it will be able to go to construction once the planning and procurement processes have been completed.</P>
        <P>The present position is that Galway County Council&rsquo;s preliminary report &mdash; which sets out details of the scope and likely cost of the scheme, and of the council&rsquo;s proposals for advancing it &mdash; is under examination in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Department&rsquo;s examination is close to being completed and the Minister is confident that a response will issue to Galway County Council within the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>Approval of the preliminary report will allow the council to draw up the contract documents, which will be used to invite tenders for the scheme.  This will be a major step forward towards <Col N="594"/>the construction phase.  The scheme is an important one for the local community, as the Deputy and I well know.  It will ensure that the town has a sewerage scheme capable of meeting current demands, that there will be capacity to service new development and that environmental standards, including water quality in local rivers, will be preserved and improved for the benefit of the town and its residents.</P>
        <P>The Minister is conscious of the fact that this scheme is urgently needed to service new development.  He has already indicated that Galway County Council can expect an early response to its preliminary report and he will ensure that there is no avoidable delay by the Department in this regard.</P>

	<P>Up to 31 December 2007, a total of 15,913 hearing loss cases had been disposed of by the Department of Defence or the State Claims Agency and a further 879 cases were outstanding. The total expenditure on these cases up to 31 December 2007 was &euro;285 million. Compensation paid totalled &euro;187.1 million and legal costs totalled &euro;97.9 million.  Of the 15,913 cases finalised, 271 were the subject of court awards and 12,741 resulted in compensation payments from out of court settlements or under the so-called &ldquo;Early Settlement Scheme&rdquo;.  A number of cases were either withdrawn or dismissed.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;Early Settlement Scheme&rdquo; (ESS) was an administrative process used to negotiate early settlements in hearing loss cases where liability was not contested. The ESS process was introduced to dispose of the large volume of claims more cost effectively and speedily than would have been the case had proceedings been allowed to reach finality through the court system.</P>
        <P>The ESS for settlement of hearing loss cases was wound up in 2004. Following the signature of a revised Delegation Order by the Government in July 2005 the management of all outstanding or new cases was delegated to the State Claims Agency with effect from 1st September 2005</P>

	<P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force as the strength sufficient to meet all foreseeable military requirements for the period comprehended by the White Paper (i.e. up to 2010). This remains the position. It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. This recruitment will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper.</P>
        <P>The agreed Programme for Government provides for an additional provision of up to 350 troops to be in training at any given time.  However, as I already made clear to the House in December last it has not been possible to provide funding to activate the provision in 2008. This is due primarily to the requirement to prioritise funding for the Chad mission. This matter will be further considered in the context of the 2009 Estimates.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 119 and 138 together.</P>
        <P>As Chairman of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, I am conscious of the need to raise public awareness of the excellent work that is being undertaken in this area by government departments and public authorities.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the Office of Emergency Planning carried out market research into this issue and the results showed that a majority of people did not know what plans the State has to deal with major emergencies or what actions they should take in the event of an emergency occurring.</P>
        <P>Following on from this research, I subsequently proposed a communications strategy to Government for the implementation of a public information and awareness campaign on emergency planning.  The campaign, which was approved by Government in October 2006, provides for the following initiatives:</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />production and countrywide distribution of an introductory handbook on emergency planning</P><Col N="597"/>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />a media advertising campaign to let people know what this handbook is about and to provide reassurance that its publication is part of the continuing development of emergency planning and not a cause for alarm.</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />the use of structured exercises on an ongoing basis by individual departments to deliver key messages on their emergency plans to the wider public.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This will be the first time that information on all of the State&rsquo;s emergency plans are presented to the public in an easy to read handbook.  The handbook will also provide practical advice on how individuals themselves can prepare for some of the more common emergencies.  The handbook will be launched in April next and it will be distributed to homes over a two-week period. The total cost is approximately &euro;2.5 million.</P>
        <P>I wrote to my Cabinet colleagues earlier this month and requested that all departments and relevant agencies exercise their plans at a strategic level in order to reassure the public that these plans are of a high standard and are kept under constant review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 151 together.</P>
        <P>I can assure the House that Defence Forces personnel requiring medical treatment are getting the care they need. The challenges in the medical arena have been recognized for some time and a review of the provision of medical services is ongoing as part of the Modernisation Agenda for the Defence Forces. The Representative Associations are involved with us in this review.  The scope of the review includes the level of service to be provided to members of the Defence Forces and the resources required for the delivery of that service.</P>
        <P>The review has already produced a Patients Charter with the agreement of all parties. I welcome the agreement on the Patients Charter as it clearly identifies the rights of members of the Defence Forces as patients, their obligations as users of the Defence Forces medical services and the obligations on the providers of the services.</P>
        <P>The full implementation of the Patients Charter is awaiting completion of the administrative procedures governing the referral by the Medical Corps of patients for external medical treatment. This is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
        <P>However, the key issue at this time is the acknowledged shortage of Medical Officers (Doctors) in the Medical Corps. The establishment for doctors is forty seven (47).  The current strength of Medical Officers serving in the Defence Forces is twenty two (22).</P>
        <P>The difficulties with the recruitment of Medical Officers have endured for some time despite the concerted efforts of my Department and the Defence Forces. The numbers attracted to work in the Defence Forces have served only to address natural wastage. The pay and allowances of doctors and dentists were recently increased substantially in consultation with the Minister for Finance. In addition, the Defence Forces have recently undertaken an intensive recruitment campaign. The results of both of these initiatives have been disappointing.</P><Col N="598"/>
        <P>The services of civilian medical Practitioners are used to provide back-up to the Medical Corps in ensuring that the primary health care requirements are met. In addition to providing primary care, the Medical Corps must also deliver a range of services to the Defence Forces including occupational medical services.  In view of the complexity of the challenge and the need for concrete steps, I have decided to engage consultants to make recommendations on the best means of meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces. I will shortly issue documents to invite tenders for this consultancy. The consultancy will deal with all relevant issues affecting the sustainable provision of the relevant medical expertise and services to the Defence Forces.  My officials have also had exploratory discussions with the Health Service Executive (HSE) about possible sharing of resources or a reciprocal arrangement that would provide opportunities for Defence Force Doctors to develop their skills and competencies and gain experience within a large health care environment. Further discussions are scheduled for the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The development of the capacity of the Medical Corps forms part of the agreed programme for Government. I am committed to providing a sustainable medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 122 together.</P>
        <P>On 8th January 2008, two members of the Permanent Defence Forces, serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) were injured when the UNIFIL vehicle in which they were travelling was targeted by a roadside bomb on the main coastal road north of Sidon.  The soldiers had superficial injuries and were taken to the local hospital in Sidon by Lebanese army personnel.  The soldiers were treated for their injuries and kept in over-night for observation.  Both were discharged from the hospital on the following day, 9th January and they then returned to Naqoura.  A UNIFIL investigation team, led by an Irish officer, is investigating this incident.  The investigation is ongoing.</P>
        <P>Seven members of the Permanent Defence Force are currently deployed in the UNIFIL HQ in Naqoura.  A further 3 personnel are serving with the Observer Group Lebanon element of United Nations Troops Supervision Organisation (UNTSO).</P>

	<P>Following Government approval to go to tender, notice of a competition for the purchase of replacement vessels for the Naval Service was sent to the Official Journal of the European Union on 24 August 2007.  The competition sought tenders for the purchase of two Offshore Patrol Vessels and one Extended Patrol Vessel, with an option for up to two additional vessels. The process comprises two stages &mdash; Stage 1, a Request for Proposals and Stage 2, an Invitation to Tender.</P>
        <P>The closing date for Stage 1- Request for Proposals was 26 October 2007.   Stage 1 Proposals are being evaluated at present in my Department and following the evaluation a detailed specification will issue to those invited to participate in Stage 2 &mdash; Invitation to Tender.  The &ldquo;Invitation to Tender&rdquo; is expected to issue in May 2008, with tenders due for return in July/August. Following detailed tender evaluation it is expected that a contract will be awarded in late 2008/early 2009 with delivery being 18 months to 2 years later.  It is likely that the vessels acquired as a result of this process will be significantly larger than those they are replacing.</P>
        <P>Recent years have seen the Air Corps take delivery of many new aircraft, with eight Pilatus trainers, 2 EC135 training helicopter and the 4 AW 139 utility helicopters.   A further 2 utility helicopters are due for delivery this year.  The main focus of the Air Corps in 2008 will be on introducing these into service and on developing their capabilities with the aircraft introduced into service in recent years.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 159 together.</P>
        <P>All members of the Permanent Defence Forces are required to undergo an annual medical examination. In 2007 a total of 8,111 annual medicals were conducted. The shortage of Medical Officers in the Medical Corps was the principal reason why every member of the Defence Forces did not undergo a medical examination in 2007.  Personnel due to serve overseas, those wishing to extend service and recruits and cadets are among those prioritised for medical examination.</P>
        <P>The services of civilian medical Practitioners are used to provide back-up to the Medical Corps in ensuring that the primary health care requirements of the Defence Forces are met. This can include retired Defence Force medical officers. However, previous service in the Defence Forces does not, of itself, constitute sufficient reason to engage any particular doctor. Annual medical examinations are part of the occupational medical service of the Defence Forces and the preference is, therefore, that they be conducted by serving Medical Officers.</P><Col N="600"/>
        <P>The challenges facing the Medical Corps have been recognized for some time and a review of the provision of medical services is ongoing as part of the Modernisation Agenda for the Defence Forces. The Representative Associations are involved with us in this review.  The scope of the review includes the level of service to be provided to members of the Defence Forces and the resources required for the delivery of that service.</P>
        <P>Given the ongoing issues and mindful of the need to make progress in this area I have decided to engage consultants to make recommendations on the best means of meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces. The potential contribution of civilian medical practitioners will be within the scope of this consultancy. The documents to invite tenders for this consultancy will be issued shortly.</P>

	<P>The Defence Forces and the Department have taken a wide variety of initiatives and have devoted extensive resources to this issue, since Dr Eileen Doyle and the External Advisory Committee presented their original report &ldquo;The Challenge of a Workplace&rdquo; in March 2002. This report addressed the entire range of interpersonal issues within the Defence Forces. Its contents and recommendations were accepted in full.</P>
        <P>An Independent Monitoring Group was established in May 2002 to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the original Doyle Report. The Independent Monitoring Group&rsquo;s own progress report, &ldquo;Response to the Challenge of a Workplace&rdquo; was launched by my predecessor on 24 September 2004. It describes the significant progress achieved since the publication of the original Doyle Report in 2002. The report is available on the Defence Forces website.</P>
        <P>The ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the Doyle report has been one of the highest priorities for the Defence Forces and the Department since its publication. Policies on equality, dignity and bullying are being constantly communicated to all ranks. I am satisfied that the military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing the matter in a continuing and proactive manner through educational modules on interpersonal relationships which are now embedded in career courses for all ranks.</P>
        <P>My Department has received a total of six (6) claims in 2007 that primarily allege bullying/harassment. In addition, seventeen (17) calls were received by Careline during 2007. Careline is an independent external confidential &ldquo;Free Phone&rdquo; Helpline and Counselling Service which was set up for members of the Permanent Defence Force in March 2003. One (1) related to bullying/harassment.</P>
        <P>The Independent Monitoring Group recommended that a review of progress within the Defence Forces should take place in 2007 and that it should be published. I can confirm that the first meeting of the review group, including representatives of military management, PDFORRA, RACO, Department of Defence and external expertise is scheduled to take place this month.</P>

	<P>KFOR was established on 10 June, 1999 in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1244, for an initial period of twelve months, to continue thereafter unless the UN Security Council decides otherwise. KFOR&rsquo;s mandate is to establish a secure environment in Kosovo conducive to the implementation of refugee return and reconstruction. KFOR has a current strength of approximately 15,000 troops drawn from 24 NATO countries and 11 non-NATO countries including Ireland, Austria, Finland and Sweden.</P>
        <P>KFOR operates under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, that is, it is entitled to use force to implement its mandate and to protect itself and the international civil presence.</P><Col N="603"/>
        <P>Ireland has participated in KFOR since August 1999. The total number of Irish troops currently serving in Kosovo is 285.  The figure is broken down as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />37th Infantry Group &mdash; 217</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Headquarters Staff &mdash; 11</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Framework Nation Staff &mdash; 57</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Irish (37th) Infantry Group, currently serves in the Multi-National Task Force (Centre) &mdash; MNTF (C) &mdash; with Ireland as current lead nation. In addition to Ireland, the Task Force also comprises troops from the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Sweden, Finland and Latvia. The Task Force&rsquo;s area of responsibility is generally the Pristina region, covering 7 municipalities with a population of approximately 1 million. The Irish commitment comprises a MOWAG mounted APC Company together with support and logistic elements and various HQ personnel.</P>
        <P>In August 2007, Ireland assumed responsibility as Framework Nation for the Multinational Task Force Centre (MNTF (C)) in KFOR for a period of 12 months and additional Defence Forces personnel were deployed to KFOR, for the Framework Nation period.  Brigadier General Gerry Hegarty from the Defence Forces assumed command of the MNTF (C) when Ireland took on the framework nation role commanding 1,200 troops from 6 nations. Currently 57 Irish Defence Forces personnel serve with the Framework Nation.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that all appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the safety of all Defence Forces personnel serving in KFOR. They are equipped with the most modern and effective equipment.  This equipment enables troops to carry out the mission assigned, as well as providing the required protection specific to the mission. I can assure the House that ongoing threat assessments are carried out in mission areas and we continually review both personal equipment and force assets, to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfil their roles. No mission is without danger, but I am satisfied that all appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the safety of all Defence Forces personnel serving in KFOR.</P>
        <P>On 17 February 2008, the Kosovo Assembly adopted a resolution which declares Kosovo to be independent. The EU General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) of 18 February agreed a common EU response to the declaration of independence, which amongst other important provisions recalled the EU&rsquo;s commitments contained in the European Conclusions of 14 December 2007, as well as the agreement to Joint Actions establishing an ESDP Police and Rule of Law mission and appointing an EU Special Representative in Kosovo. The conclusions also stated that the EU will continue to cooperate with the UN, KFOR, OSCE and other international actors in order to preserve stability in the region.</P>
        <P>I was speaking to Brigadier General Gerry Hegarty earlier this morning and he informed me that the situation in Kosovo, following this declaration remains relatively calm. KFOR troops are on standby and patrolling.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 165 together.</P>
        <P>The Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and Women, or &Oacute;glaigh N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na h&Eacute;ireann Teoranta (ONET) has enjoyed the long-standing official recognition of my Department and the Defence Forces.  ONET is dedicated to looking after the welfare of all ex-service personnel of the Irish Defence Forces. A main objective of ONET is to ensure the welfare of ex-servicemen and women by way of providing accommodation to homeless members in need of such domestic accommodation and providing other assistance that may be required by way of advising referrals to the relevant agencies.</P>
        <P>The Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA) was formed in 1990. Membership is available to those, both serving and retired, who have successfully completed a tour of duty with a UN Force or Organisation.  Both associations are financed primarily through membership fees, voluntary contributions and fundraising.</P>
        <P>In October 2006, in recognition of the valuable work of ONET and IUNVA and to mark almost 50 years of Defence Forces involvement in international peacekeeping with the United Nations, I was pleased to support the work of both organisations in the form of a once off grant of &euro;50,000 to each from my Department.</P>
        <P>The Agreed Programme for Government June 2007 commits to the provision of annual subventions to ONET and IUNVA. I am advised that this can best be achieved through the payment of an annual grant-in-aid to both of these voluntary organisations. Officials from my Department are currently in discussions with both organisations with regard to the arrangements for the payment of these grants-in-aid.</P>

	<P>The information sought by the Deputy is in the form of a Tabular Statement.</P>
        <P>The figures in the Tabular Statement represent the amounts paid in settlement of actions against the Minister for Defence. They include payments to serving and non-serving members of the Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces in respect of personal injuries and material damage. They also include amounts paid to Civilian Employees, and members of the public. I am concerned, of course, to ensure that such claims are kept to a minimum and that when they do arise they are dealt with expeditiously and efficiently.</P>
        <P>The State Claims Agency has been working with the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence to examine incidents giving rise to claims and trends emerging in order to identify and obviate, if possible, the underlying causes of injury to civilian and Defence Forces personnel.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the Defence Forces established a Risk Management Steering Group and a Risk Management Implementation Group to implement the overall Defence Forces Risk Management Policy. An Instruction on Health and Safety Risk Management was promulgated throughout the Defence Forces in 2006.</P>
        <P>During 2006, external auditors from the State Claims Agency carried out a comprehensive audit of the Defence Forces Health and Safety Management systems. This audit examined systems in Defence Forces HQ, in each Formation and in 14 different Units selected by the auditors. All areas audited met with OHSAS 18001 standards. The Defence Forces is the first State organisation to have its Safety Management System validated by the State Claims Agency.</P>

	<P>Defence Forces Regulations require members of the Defence Forces to live in Barracks unless they are given permission to live out.  Over the years the practice has been for significant numbers of personnel to live out of barracks.</P>
        <P>Currently, the Defence Forces have the capacity to provide long-term living-in accommodation for up to 2,800 personnel, which represents about 25% of all personnel.  This is in <Col N="606"/>addition to a significant capacity to provide short-term accommodation for those engaged in training or participating in military exercises or operations.</P>
        <P>As part of the Defence Forces modernisation programme &euro;40m (approximately) has been spent from 1999 to-date on refurbishing both long-term and short-term accommodation across the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Arising from the changing security situation and to provide a sound basis for future modernisation of living-in accommodation my Department, in conjunction with the military authorities, is undertaking a study to identify the Defence Forces&rsquo; overall operational requirement for personnel required to live in barracks and the standard of accommodation to be provided.   I expect that this work will be completed in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The outcome of the study will provide the basis for a 3-5 year programme of refurbishment of living-in accommodation to be undertaken in conjunction with the overall Defence Force Infrastructure Development Programme.  In considering the priorities for the building programme for 2008 and 2009 my Department has decided that no further costs will be incurred on the refurbishment of living-in accommodation until the 3-5 year plan is in place.</P>
        <P>The requirement for living-in accommodation in Cathal Brugha Barracks is being considered as part of the overall Defence Force requirements and the provision of any accommodation required there will be addressed in the 3-5 year programme.</P>
        <P>Arising from the outcome of the living-in study I will also consider amending the Regulations to reflect a change in emphasis from one of people living in unless given permission to live out, to one of people living out unless required to live-in.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the call by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to raise the minimum age for membership of the Defence Forces to 18; the number of personnel under 18 who are currently full members or in training; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[6336/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I have carefully considered the recent report of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child including the suggesting of raising the minimum age for recruitment to the Defence Forces. Attracting, training and retaining good calibre personnel are key factors in maintaining the successful operation of the Defence Forces at home and abroad. The Defence Forces compete to attract these personnel and the current arrangements governing the age for recruitment forms part of the overall human resources strategy.</P><Col N="607"/>
        <P>Under Defence Forces Regulations and Administrative Instructions, the minimum age for &lsquo;general service enlistment&rsquo; to all branches of the Defence Forces is 17 years. General service enlistment is immediately followed by a basic training period of several months, before the recruit is &ldquo;passed out&rdquo; as an active member of the PDF. The duration and structure of this training is such that few enlisted personnel become available for any operational military duties within the State while they are under 18 years of age. Members of the Defence Forces must be over 18 years of age before they are deployed abroad on peace support operations.</P>
        <P>The minimum age of entry for cadets is also 17 years. Cadets undergo a structured programme of training of more than 12 months duration that leads to the award of a Commission as a junior Officer.</P>
        <P>The minimum age of entry for the Reserve Defence Force is also 17. Members of the Reserve are not accepted as being trained to the minimum standard required for Reserve operations until they have completed their &lsquo;Three Star Private&rsquo; Course that is normally conducted in the second year of service. Therefore the vast majority of Reserve entrants are not eligible for any operational military duties until they are at least of age 18.</P>
        <P>There is one exception to the legal minimum age of 17 years.  Regulations currently permit the recruitment of trade &lsquo;apprentices&rsquo; for the PDF specifically as trade apprentices from the age of 16 onwards. However, administrative practice is to set the minimum entry age for PDF apprentice entrants at 17 years. Apprentice entrants are assigned to special technological courses of training and study lasting for 3-4 years. Apprentices are not assigned to military duties until they have completed their specialist technical/ technological training.</P>
        <P>In practice, therefore, Defence Forces personnel who are under 18 years of age are essentially in the preliminary stages of training. They remain under the direct supervision of experienced and competent Officers and Non Commissioned Officers. They are within a supportive and structured military training system that optimises their development and continually reviews and assesses their progress in training.</P>
        <P>Applicants for the Defence Forces who are under 18 years of age must have the written consent of a parent or a legal guardian.</P>
        <P>In recent years, about 22% of the personnel intake into the Permanent Defence Force has been under 18 years of age at entry. There are currently 29 personnel serving in the PDF who are under 18 years of age, 27 of whom are still in training.  There are currently 251 personnel serving in the Reserve Defence Force who are under 18 years of age. Of these 199 are undergoing recruit training, 34 are undergoing &ldquo;Two-Star&rdquo; to &ldquo;Three-Star&rdquo; training and the remaining 18 have achieved Private Three-Star rank.</P>
        <P>In the light of the foregoing explanation and the requirement to attract good personnel and key skills to the PDF and to local units of the RDF, I do not propose to amend the minimum age for recruitment to the Defence Forces.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The key issue in the provision of medical services to the Defence Forces at this time is the acknowledged shortage of Medical Officers (Doctors) in the Medical Corps. The establishment for doctors is forty seven (47).  The current strength of Medical Officers serving in the Defence Forces is twenty two (22).</P>
        <P>The difficulties with the recruitment of Medical Officers have endured for some time despite the concerted efforts of my Department and the Defence Forces. The numbers attracted to work in the Defence Forces have served only to address natural wastage. The pay and allowances of doctors and dentists were recently increased substantially in consultation with the Minister for Finance. In addition, the Defence Forces have recently undertaken an intensive recruitment campaign. The results of both of these initiatives have been disappointing.</P><Col N="609"/>
        <P>The services of civilian medical Practitioners are used to provide back-up to the Medical Corps in ensuring that the primary health care requirements are met. In addition to providing primary care, the Medical Corps must also deliver a range of services to the Defence Forces including occupational medical services.  In view of the complexity of the challenge and the need for concrete steps, I have decided to engage consultants to make recommendations on the best means meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces. I will shortly issue documents to invite tenders for this consultancy. The consultancy will deal with all relevant issues affecting the sustainable provision of the relevant medical expertise and services to the Defence Forces.</P>

        <P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force as the strength sufficient to meet all foreseeable military requirements for the period comprehended by the White Paper (i.e. up to 2010). This remains the position. It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. This recruitment will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper.</P>
        <P>The agreed Programme for Government provides for an additional provision of up to 350 troops to be in training at any given time.  However, due primarily to the requirement to prioritise funding for the Chad mission, it has not been possible to provide funding to activate this provision in 2008. This matter will be further considered in the context of the 2009 Estimates.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Defence provides for an allocation of up to 850 Permanent Defence Force personnel to be deployed overseas at any one time. While this may be exceeded for short periods, deployments above this level are not sustainable on an ongoing basis within existing resources.  Any commitments to EU or UN missions will be met within this context.</P>
        <P>The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces continues to be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence. Significant investment has taken place in recent years across all facets and elements of the Defence Forces. This investment has been assisted by pay savings arising from the reduction in the strength of the Permanent Defence Force in the context of the White Paper, which have been fully re-invested in the provision of equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>From the Army&rsquo;s perspective the major investment has been in the contracts for Mowag Armoured Personnel Carriers. In the period from 2001 to 2007 the Defence Forces acquired a <Col N="610"/>total of eighty Mowag APCs, manufactured in Switzerland, at a cost of &euro;120m. The APCs have been used extensively on overseas service and will be in operational service in Chad.</P>
        <P>It is expected that a tender competition for the purchase of Light Tactical Armoured Vehicle will be initiated over the next three months. A sum of some &euro;6m is provided in the 2008 provision to allow for a down payment under a contract in the latter part of this year.</P>
        <P>There has also been a substantive programme for the acquisition of modern transport vehicles over the years. Acquisitions include Nissan patrols, minibuses, Ford transits, heavy load carrying vehicles (Drops) and specialist EOD vehicles.</P>
        <P>In recent years, significant work has been carried out on the acquisition of an Integrated Protection and Load Carrying System. This system includes Body Armour, Helmets, Rucksacks and Battle Vests. 8000 units of Body Armour, 12,000 Helmets and 12,000 Rucksacks have been delivered in recent years at a combined total cost of &euro;13.5m.</P>
        <P>To complete the modern integrated protection and load carrying system, an order has been placed for the supply of 12,000 Battle Vests at a cost of some &euro;2.2m. The Battle Vests are used for the carriage of essential items such as ammunition, personal radio, water and ancillary equipment. The order will be completed by the second half of 2008.</P>
        <P>The level of investment in military equipment has ensured that Defence Force&rsquo;s personnel have the most modern and effective range of equipment to carry our their day-to-day roles both at home and overseas and for training purposes and I will ensure that this investment will continue into the future.</P>

        <P>The Memorial being designed by the artist, Mr. Brian King, is a pyramid shape made primarily of granite slabs resting on a steel frame interspaced with toughened glass panels. In the structure there are figures representing members of the Defence Forces.  Four Defence Forces personnel in relief are cast in bronze, representing the Air Corps, Army and Naval Service both permanent and reserve.</P>
        <P>The concept is simple in theory but has proven more difficult in practice due to the intricacy of the design and the need to ensure precise compatibility of each component part.</P>
        <P>This is a complex art piece comprising many components, the four main components being, stone, steel, glass and bronze. Each individual component is crafted by specialists and the artist has worked closely with the various craftspeople to ensure precision in each component part to ensure minimum delay in constructing the piece.  It is important that the extra time needed is spent at this stage to ensure the overall success of the project when it goes on site.</P>
        <P>The memorial, which will be situated in Merrion Square, Dublin, is expected to be completed by the end of June 2008.</P>

        <Quest>  the progress made in regard to <Col N="612"/>promoting greater cooperation and knowledge sharing between the coastguard, the Navy and the Air Corps to ensure that the waters surrounding Ireland are safer for seafarers and coastal communities and preventing their use for the illegal importation of illicit drugs.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime Search and Rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue region, for pollution and salvage response in the marine environment, and for marine safety awareness. Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking rests primarily with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in relation to Search and Rescue and drugs interdiction.  In this regard, the Naval Service and Air Corps provide support to the civil authorities as the need arises and within their available capability.</P>
        <P>A Service Level Agreement is currently being finalised between my Department and the Department of Transport for the provision of services to the Irish Coast Guard by the Defence Forces. The overall operation and implementation of the Service Level Agreement will be monitored by a Steering Group comprising representatives of my Department, the Defence Forces, the Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard. At an operational level, the parties to the Agreement are committed to the achievement of its objectives through co-operation and partnership between the main service providers, namely the Naval Service, the Air Corps, the Army, and the Irish Coast Guard.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department and the Defence Forces are represented on the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee, which is chaired by the Irish Coast Guard. The IMSAR Committee meets twice yearly and its functions are to keep under review the general arrangements for marine search and rescue in Ireland, to consider the implications of any intended changes in equipment, deployment or organisation in any arm of the Committee, and to consider as necessary liaison with neighbouring search and rescue organisations and any regional search and rescue agreements in which Ireland is a participant. The Defence Forces also participate in regular search and rescue exercises with the Irish Coast Guard.</P>
        <P>Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.</P>
        <P>The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities.</P>
        <P>There is close co-operation between the civil authorities &mdash; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service  &mdash; and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.</P>
        <P>The Naval Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Customs Service are represented on the National Maritime Security Committee, as is the Irish Coast Guard. This committee provides another useful forum for the exchange of experience and information between the Defence Forces and the civil authorities.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied with the progress is being made in regard to promoting greater co-operation and knowledge sharing between the Irish Coast Guard and the Defence Forces with regard to maritime safety. I am similarly satisfied that the extent of Naval Service and Air Corps reconnaissance, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Irish <Col N="613"/>Coast Guard, has had and will continue to have a major and beneficial impact in deterring drug trafficking and other illegal activities.</P>

	<P>The White Paper on Defence 2000 outlines the blueprint for the Reserve Defence Force (RDF). The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan provides for the phased enhancement of Reserve capabilities over the period to the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>The plan provided for a non-integrated Army Reserve with an establishment of 9,292 personnel, and a Naval Service Reserve with an establishment of 400 personnel.  Revised organisational structures which included closure and amalgamation of units, came into effect in <Col N="615"/>October 2005.   The Reserve has been re-organised along similar lines to the PDF with three brigades, a Reserve Defence Force Training Authority and a dedicated Naval Service Reserve. Improvements in clothing, equipment and quantity and quality of training have been delivered.  These factors were identified as being important issues for members of the Reserve, as well as being necessary to improve the overall capability of the Reserve.  In addition, the Plan provides for the development of an Integrated Army Reserve. In accordance with the Implementation Plan, a pilot scheme for the Integrated Reserve was run in 2007.   The military authorities have advised me that the Integrated Reserve will continue to be developed in 2008 in the light of experience gained during 2007.</P>

	<P>The question of the recruitment of foreign-nationals to the Defence Forces is not a new one.  Defence Force Regulations have always allowed for the recruitment of foreign-nationals to the Defence Forces.  People from diverse backgrounds have already been employed in the Defence Forces, but this has mainly been in certain specialised areas. This has worked well &mdash; albeit on a limited scale.  Currently my emphasis is on ensuring that there are no barriers to ethnic minorities or foreign nationals joining the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Entry to the Permanent Defence Force is either through the Cadetship Competition, Apprenticeship Competition, General Service Enlistment or Direct Entry Competitions which are held to fill vacancies in specialist appointments.  All applicants for each of these entry streams are required to meet qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>The Cadet Competition is the entry level for recruitment as an Officer of the Defence Forces.  As you are aware, I have made changes to the Cadet competition to broaden the entry criteria thereby making it easier for qualifying foreign nationals to apply for cadetships.</P>
        <P>The Chief of Staff has undertaken a review of enlistment into the Defence Forces at all levels and as a result the Defence Forces have begun to implement a number of changes, which will further facilitate the recruitment and retention of people from ethnic and cultural minorities:</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />A strategy for Cultural Diversity Management is currently being put in place.  Many organisations in Ireland have experience in this area including the Health Service Executive and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Defence Forces is liaison with these organisations to ensure that its strategy reflects accepted strategies across the Public Service.</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />The Defence Forces are currently establishing links with  ethical and cultural community groups based in Ireland, in order to brief the groups on the Defence Forces and its current entry requirements.

	<P>The Review of implementation of the White Paper on Defence 2000 was published in April 2007.</P>
        <P>The White Paper set a target for implementing change and reorganisation in the Department of Defence and Defence Forces over a 10-year period.   The Review of implementation finds that good progress has been made.    Particularly noteworthy are the improvements in equipment, infrastructure, training and Human Resources management.  The emphasis on developing capabilities and improving interoperability has been successful and continues to facilitate the Defence Forces contribution to peace and security at home and internationally.  The reorganisation of the Reserve, set to continue out to 2009, and establishment of the Civil Defence Board on a statutory basis are also significant.  The review also noted that the progress achieved had also accommodated very significant developments in the national and international defence and security environments and extensive internal reorganisation and restructuring to the Defence organisation.  The Review is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>Under the revised VRT system, the VRT rate applicable to both new and used imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008 will be determined by the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission rating of the car and will no longer be related to engine size.  As outlined in Annex D to the Summary of 2008 Budget Measures, in respect of pre-owned used cars imported after 1 July 2008, the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions will have to be declared to the Revenue Commissioners on form VRT4 (declaration for registration of a used vehicle) by the person registering the vehicle.</P>
        <P>The declaration will be required to be supported by documentary evidence of the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  Acceptable documentary evidence (provided the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions is shown) will include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a certificate of conformity for the particular model, (since 2001, EU law requires CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission levels to be recited in this document),</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Where a certificate or a measurement confirming CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> levels for a vehicle is not available or does not satisfy the Revenue Commissioners, VRT will be charged on registration at the maximum rate allowable i.e. 36%.  Such a VRT rating would be open to appeal through the VRT appeals system.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the construction and refurbishment of qualifying mental health centres which was introduced by me in the 2006 Finance Act and commenced in January 2007.  It is intended that the scheme will operate on broadly the same terms and conditions as already apply in the case of the similar relief for general private hospitals. Among the conditions that must be satisfied if a mental health facility is to qualify for tax relief under the scheme is that the facility is an approved centre (i.e. registered under the Mental Health Act, 2001) and that it must have a minimum of 20 in-patient beds. As I mentioned in my 2006 Budget speech , the scheme is estimated to cost &euro;2 million in a full year.  Preliminary data on the scheme at aggregate level derived from 2007 personal tax returns, to be returned in November 2008 via the Revenue on-line System (ROS), should become available from early 2009.</P>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information on the scheme of tax relief for private hospitals was for the first time specified and separately included in personal income tax returns for the tax year 2004, which were due for filing in October, 2005. No specific Revenue information on the cost of the scheme is available for the tax year 2002 (when the scheme of relief for private hospitals was introduced) or for 2003. Based on the information that has been received and collated to date for the tax year 2004, there were 37 claims for &euro;4.5 million capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals. This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost of the order of &euro;1.9 million for these returns in terms of income tax foregone.</P>
        <P>Corresponding data available for the tax year 2005 indicates that there were 60 claims for &euro;7.7 million capital allowances for the construction of buildings used for private hospitals.

	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the scheme of capital allowances for capital expenditure on registered nursing homes <Col N="624"/>which was introduced in 1997. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information on the scheme of tax relief for registered nursing homes was for the first time specified and separately included in personal income tax returns for the tax year 2004, which were due for filing in October, 2005. No specific Revenue information on the cost of the scheme is available for the tax year 2003 or previous years. Based on the information that has been received and collated to date for the tax year 2004, there were 287 claims for &euro;16.6 million capital allowances for the construction of nursing homes. This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost of the order of &euro;7 million for these returns in terms of income tax and corporation tax foregone.</P>
        <P>Corresponding data available for the tax year 2005 indicates that there were 498 claims for &euro;30.3 million capital allowances for the construction of nursing homes. This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost of the order of &euro;12.4 million for these returns in terms of income tax foregone.  Corresponding data based on 2006 returns is in the process of being compiled and is not yet available.</P>
        <P>As regards projected costs, there is no system of prior application and approval under the scheme of tax relief for the construction or refurbishment of registered nursing homes. When the relevant facilities have been completed, and provided they meet the necessary criteria, investors can then claim tax relief on the expenditure incurred under the scheme in their annual income tax returns as part of the self-assessment system. All returns are subject to check and possible audit to ensure that, among other things, the tax relief is correctly claimed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that training provided by an employer in the context of skills development of an employee of that employer &mdash; be it for the employee&rsquo;s current or future role with that employer &mdash; is not treated as giving rise to a taxable emolument where the training undertaken is relevant to the business of the employer.  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where re-training is linked to a redundancy setting, and forms part and parcel of an overall redundancy package, then the normal tax rules relating to redundancy payments apply. </P>
        <P>When making returns to Revenue of benefits-in-kind and other non-cash benefits provided by them to their employees, employers are not required to identify the different types of benefit.  There is, therefore, no basis for estimating the yield to the Exchequer from treating training provided for any future employment as a taxable emolument.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The scheme of capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private hospitals was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and came into effect in May 2002. Provided that capital expenditure on the proposed co-located private hospitals, which are designed to free-up capacity in public hospitals, conforms with the existing legislation governing that scheme, normal tax relief will apply.</P>
        <P>The cost of such tax relief will ultimately depend on the level of qualifying capital expenditure and no such expenditure on the proposed co-located hospitals has yet been incurred.  For each &euro;100 million of qualifying capital expenditure on these hospitals, the cost of tax relief to investors (assuming a marginal tax rate of 41% for those investors) would amount in gross terms to &euro;41 million spread over 7 years.  Of course, with the additional activity generated by the construction of the hospitals, the employment generated and the related services provided on which taxes will be paid, additional revenues would accrue to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>In relation to the hospital co-location initiative, I have been informed by the Minister for Health and Children that the Board of the HSE has approved the successful bidder status on six sites as follows: Waterford Regional Hospital, Cork University Hospital, Limerick Regional Hospital, Sligo Regional Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, St James&rsquo;s Hospital.  Since then, the hospitals and the bidders have been working towards finalising the Project Agreements. It is expected that the Project Agreements for Beaumont, Cork and Limerick hospitals will be signed very soon. It is also anticipated that the signing of the Project Agreements for the other three sites will be concluded shortly thereafter.  Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, which <Col N="626"/>are also participating in the co-location initiative, are at an earlier stage of the procurement process.  A tender in relation to Connolly Hospital is under consideration and it is expected that the invitation to tender (ITT) for Tallaght Hospital will issue in the near future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Valuation Act 2001, which came into effect on 2 May 2002, provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose including constructions affixed thereto are rateable.  In regard to the Valuation Act, 2001, I should point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Act, and that I, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, have no function in decisions in this regard.</P>
        <P>The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) are rateable unless expressly exempted under schedule 4.  Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 outlines the categories of property and the various uses that are deemed to be non rateable under the Act. Paragraphs 10 (education) and 16 (charitable purposes) are two areas in that schedule which may be relevant to the rateability of child care facilities.  Accordingly, purpose-built child care buildings designed and used to make profit are rateable as commercial buildings. Houses which have been adapted for commercial use in a dedicated area (i.e. converted garage for exclusive use as child care) are rateable, for that specific area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Valuation Act 2001 maintains the long-standing position that commercial facilities &mdash; including all private child care - facilities such as play schools, preschools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools &mdash; are liable for rates.  It was not intended that the Valuation Act 2001 would expand or contract the valuation base.  The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property.  Any individual ratepayer who <Col N="628"/>has concerns about the valuation of their property or of any part thereof, including its rateability or the method of calculation may, on payment of a statutory fee of &euro;250, apply to the Valuation Office for a revision of the valuation.  If dissatisfied with the outcome, they may appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is also a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>

	<P>The assessment of eligibility to medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged over 70 who have an automatic entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants.  Under Section 45 of the Health Act 1970, medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  </P>
        <P>Section 58 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, provided for GP visit cards for adult persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the HSE, and notwithstanding that they do not qualify for a medical card, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange GP medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  In assessing eligibility, the HSE uses guidelines based on the applicant&rsquo;s means, which includes their income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child <Col N="629"/>care) and travel to work.  The assessment process also takes account of other factors, such as medical or social need, which may impact on their ability to meet the cost of GP services.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Executive that its guiding principle in setting a medical card review date is to set a date in each case at which an income/dependency change or other change could reasonably be expected to occur which could affect eligibility.  I am further informed by the Executive that, in general, the cases of persons whose sole income is derived from Invalidity Pension are subject to review every five years.</P>

	<P>I am unaware of such an investigation, referred to by the Deputy being carried out.  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme was introduced in 1993.  Under the legislation providing for the Scheme the Health Service Executive (HSE) can make a grant payable towards the cost of providing nursing care in a registered private nursing home.  </P>
        <P>In order to qualify for a subvention the individual must be sufficiently dependent to require maintenance in a nursing home and unable to pay any or part of the cost of maintenance in the home, i.e., you must pass a means test.  In 2007 the HSE circulated National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme to all Local Health Offices.  The Guidelines are also available on the HSE&rsquo;s website.  Under the guidelines, the assessment of means is to be carried out using a national standard financial assessment method.</P>
        <P>On a related note, I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of sheltered housing.  In 2007 the Department of the Environment, <Col N="631"/>Heritage and Local Government established a Cross Departmental Team on Sheltered Housing, involving the Department of Health and Children, the HSE, Office for Social Inclusion and the local authorities.  The Cross Departmental Team will, in conjunction with the Office of the Minister for Older People, develop and oversee policy in relation to sheltered housing provision for older people and agree protocols for integrated management and delivery of housing and related care services.  The establishment of the Cross Departmental Team forms part of an overall strategic response to the housing needs of older people, as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Housing Policy Statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The moves referred to by the Deputy are not connected with the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation initiative.  They are, in fact, part of a programme ongoing within the HSE since February 2006 for the development of a national shared services function across the organisation.  The HSE is already a decentralised organisation with staff employed at locations across the country.</P>
        <P>Shared services is the name given to the various support functions such as finance, human resources, procurement and ICT which are essential to the running of any organisation.  The HSE views the introduction of shared services across a number of functions as a major transformation programme which has the potential to deliver significant and important efficiencies and benefits to the organisation.  There is a commitment within the HSE to established three shared services sites in Manorhamilton, Dublin and Kilkenny.  The Dublin and Manorhamilton locations will undertake human resource processes, while finance will have a shared services operation located in Kilkenny.</P>
        <P>The National Human Resources Shared Services Centre will be responsible for providing HR services, including recruitment, superannuation and personnel administration across the entire Executive.  Work of this nature is currently being migrated from a local level to these centralised offices.   Work that the Executive deems unsuitable for this National Office, will be undertaken at HSE Area level in HR Departments located in Cork, Tullamore, Galway and Kells.  The HSE believes that this approach will contribute towards greater efficiency and less duplication in the delivery of practices through the streamlining of key HR processes.  The HSE <Col N="632"/>has informed me that, as a result of this consolidation of work, the recruitment and superannuation functions currently based at the sites in St. Canice&rsquo;s Hospital and Kilcreene Hospital, Kilkenny, referred to by the Deputy, will, in time, be delivered from this HR shared services centres.</P>
        <P>The HSE have established a national joint working group comprised of HSE management and trade union officials with an independent chairperson, which oversees this national shared services project and full consultation will occur with staff as and when the implementation plan is full developed.  As per previous agreements, every HSE employee working in Human Resource services will be accommodated in the location where they are currently employed and will fill vacancies locally.</P>

	<P>Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments.  The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, Parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
        <P>Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient&rsquo;s eligibility.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the LTI can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;90 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</P>

	<P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre (NDSC) was established in late 1998 conjointly by the eight Health Boards and with the approval of the Minister of Health and Children.  The NDSC was governed by a Board of Management nominated by the Chief Executives of the Health Boards and the Department of Health and Children.  With the establishment of the Health Service Executive (HSE) the NDSC became the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) under the aegis of the HSE on 1st January 2005.</P>
        <P>The Mission Statement of the HPSC is &ldquo;To improve the health of the Irish population by provision of the best possible information on disease including infectious diseases through surveillance and independent advice, epidemiological investigation, research and training.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>HPSC has six main areas of responsibility, namely, surveillance of some of the major communicable diseases; operational support by providing expert advice to, and responding to requests for support from, departments of public health or hospitals; training for professionals working in communicable disease control; research in identifying and developing best practice in communicable diseases; policy advice to Departments and appropriate agencies in relation to the development of standards, guidelines and practices, and promoting the adoption of best practice by different agencies; and providing information on infectious diseases to the public and the media.</P>

	<P>The Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) is part of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and is subject to its governance structures.  The PCRS does not therefore have a board in its own right.  The PCRS discharges the functions, which prior to 2005, were undertaken by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.  Part 10 of the Health Act 2004 effected, inter alia, the dissolution of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board and the transfer of its functions, employees, lands and property to the HSE.  </P>
        <P>It supports the delivery of primary healthcare by providing reimbursement services to Primary Care contractors (General Practitioners, Pharmacists, Dentists and Optometrists/Ophthalmologists) who have contracts with the HSE to provide services to members of the public in their own community.  In addition, the PCRS also reimburses Primary Care contractors for services provided to eligible recipients under a variety of community schemes, including the Drugs Payment Scheme, the Long Term Illness Scheme, the Dental Treatment Services Scheme, the Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme, the High Tech Drugs Scheme, the Methadone Treatment Scheme and the Community Ophthalmic Services Scheme.</P>
        <P>Each year, the HSE publishes the Primary Care Reimbursement Service&rsquo;s statistical analysis of claims and payments.  The 2006 report shows that over 2.26 million persons used the services of primary care contractors that year and that the PCRS processed in excess of 60 million transactions, with associated expenditure under a range of schemes amounting to over &euro;2.07 billion.</P>

        <P>The Council has an independent advisory and monitoring role in relation to the implementation of the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy and reports to the Minister for Children, in that regard. Its functions are:</P>
 <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to advise the Minister on all aspects of children&rsquo;s lives, including the development of child well-being indicators;</P>
 <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to advise the Minister on the better co-ordination and delivery of services to children;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to contribute to the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Strategy;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to undertake and advise on research and to advise on training in relation to the Strategy;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to advise on the development of mechanisms to consult with children.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The National Children&rsquo;s Advisory Council provides independent advice to the Minister for Children. Through its diverse membership the Council is uniquely placed to provide advice, which reflects a combination of expertise and practical &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; experience.  The Council also plays an important role in monitoring the implementation of the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy. One of the key features of the Council, when it was first established, was that for the first time, an Advisory Council to the Minister included youth members who would work alongside nominees from the statutory and voluntary sector.  The current Council includes five youth members who have been elected by the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Forum of the Office of the Minister for Children.  Further information on the Council is available on www.ncac.ie.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 276 and 277 together.</P>
        <P>The National Childcare Strategy: A Report of the Partnership 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare (1999) recommended the establishment of a National Childcare Management Committee.  Following this recommendation a new National Childcare Co-ordinating Commit<Col N="653"/>tee (NCCC) was established in late 1999 and held it&rsquo;s first meeting on 17th December 1999.  The NCCC is chaired by the Office of the Minister for Children (OMC).</P>
        <P>When the Committee was first established it was tasked with several functions including to advise in relation to the development of a childcare infrastructure, to advise the Minister in relation to childcare under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, and to develop a co-ordinated approach to childcare provision over the life of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP).  The NCCC was also tasked to assist in the development of the CCCs, which were successfully launched in 2001, and to initiate research into childcare provision at both national and local level.  With the introduction of the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) and the coming to an end of the EOCP, the terms of reference of the NCCC were revised in June 2007 and its functions include providing advice and assistance to the OMC in relation to the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010, including childcare issues under the NCIP and the National Childcare Training Strategy, and in regard to Siolt&aacute;, the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education, and the Framework for Early Learning.  The NCCC is also tasked with developing a co-ordinated national approach to childcare provision during 2007 -2010.</P>
        <P>The Committee currently has 30 members who represent the organisations listed below.  Where vacancies arise they are filled, generally, by the nominating body.  Office of the Minister for Children (Chair); Department of Education and Science; Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU); Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC); Community Pillar; Farming Pillar (IFA); Regional Assemblies (BMW, S&amp;E); F&Aacute;S; HSE; IPPA &mdash; The Early Childhood Organisation; Barnardos; Childminding Ireland; National Children&rsquo;s Nurseries Association (NCNA); Forbairt Naoinra&iacute; Teo; St Nicholas Montessori Society of Ireland; Irish Steiner Waldorf Early Learning Education Association; National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland; County Childcare Committees; Pobal Ltd; Chambers of Commerce Ireland; Planet; Community Groups National Representatives Network; Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education (CEDCE); Dublin Institute of Technology (Childcare Training).</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 278 and 289 together.</P>
        <P>The meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on 12 February 2008 allowed for a frank and open discussion on the issues of concern to pharmacists arising from the decision to introduce revised wholesale pricing arrangements from 1st March 2008.  The meeting also enabled the Health Service Executive (HSE) to outline its plans in respect of the interim pharmacy contract with a flat rate dispensing fee, which it is offering to pharmacists on a <Col N="654"/>voluntary basis to address concerns about the alleged impact of the new wholesale pricing arrangements on GMS-dependent pharmacists, in particular.</P>
        <P>I am concerned, in particular, to support pharmacies which have a high proportion of medical card patients and where a dispensing fee of &euro;3.27 applies for most transactions.  Many of these pharmacies are in rural or inner city areas and provide an important social and health service. With my support, the HSE has indicated it is prepared to offer a higher fee, of no less than &euro;5 per item dispensed, to community pharmacists, on the basis of an interim contract which would be essentially the same as the existing contract.</P>
        <P>The Government is firm in its view that the wholesale mark-up paid on the price of drugs should be reduced to a level that is fair to both taxpayers and wholesalers.  The existing mark-up in the range of 15-17.6% is neither reasonable nor sustainable.  The decision to pay an 8% mark-up from 1 March, and 7% from 1 January 2009, will go ahead.</P>
        <P>At this point, the HSE has not been formally notified by any community pharmacist of their intention to withdraw services under the present pharmacy contract.</P>
        <P>I met with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union last week and heard their point that there should be an independent assessment of the fees offered. In the light of this, I am establishing an Independent Body to begin work immediately to assess an interim, fair community pharmacy dispensing fee of at least &euro;5 to be paid for the medical card scheme, the Drugs Payment Scheme and other community drug schemes.  This Body will be chaired by Se&aacute;n Dorgan, former Head of IDA Ireland.  It will take submissions from all sides and will carry out its own analysis.  It will be asked to make its recommendations by the end of May 2008.  Its recommended fee level, subject to Government approval, will be backdated to 1 March 2008.  The development of the substantive new contract will get under way immediately and will be completed as soon as possible; this will be done under the auspices of an agreed facilitator and it too will be priced by the Independent Body.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the Independent Body are: To advise the Minister for Health and Children on the appropriate level of dispensing fee to be paid to community pharmacists for existing services provided under the GMS and community drug schemes having regard to; (i) the overall public interest including the issues of patient safety and continuity of supply; (ii) the fee of &euro;5 per item which has already been offered; (iii) the reasonable costs incurred by pharmacists in providing services under the schemes and the value of the professional service of dispensing; and (iv) the statutory obligation on the HSE to use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public; and to submit a report on the matter to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The requested date for submission of the report is 31 May 2008.  Both the HSE as the contracting body and the IPU as the representative organisation for community pharmacists, along with other stakeholders, will be entitled to make submissions to the Independent Body addressing whatever factors and issues are of concern to them.</P>
        <P>The Independent Body will also be entitled to engage whatever outside expertise it requires to assist it with its task.  Based on its consideration of submissions received and its own independent evaluation, the body will recommend an appropriate dispensing fee to my Department that would, in its view, represent a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the pharmaceutical service currently being provided by community pharmacists to the HSE under the GMS and community drug schemes.</P><Col N="655"/>
        <P>Each pharmacist will have three options: to avail of the interim contract as outlined by the HSE letter of 2 January 2008 immediately; to accept the interim contract upon the report of the Independent Body; or to stay with the existing retail fee structure until the agreement of a substantive new contract.  I believe this provides all concerned with a reasonable way to make the transition to a fair and transparent method of payment for present services and, I hope, greatly developed pharmacy services in the near future.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which will invest &euro;575 million over 5 years, with &euro;358 million of this in capital grant aid for childcare services.</P>
        <P>Capital applications approved under the NCIP are subject to certain criteria, one of which is that contracts should be signed within one year from the notification date of approval or face decommittal.  I understand that the Group referred to by the Deputy is approaching their contractual deadline of one year.  A decision on the status of their approved funding has not been taken at this time.  In each case, and having regard to all other relevant factors, account is taken of any particular circumstances which may have applied.  The Group will be notified of the position in due course.</P>
        <P>I understand that in December 2007 the Group in question contacted Pobal, which manages the day to day operation of the NCIP on behalf of my Office, to enquire whether it would be possible to receive additional funding to expand the proposed service.  I also understand, that, following discussion with Pobal and the local County Childcare Committee, the Group confirmed that they would be in a position to complete the proposed service expansion within their allocated budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 306 and 307 together.</P>
        <P>There is ongoing North/South co-operation in relation to many health issues.  I met with Minister McGimpsey, Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland in October and November 2007.  The specific issue of MRSA/hospital associated infections was not discussed on those particular occasions.  However, since the early part of this decade our National SARI Group has worked jointly with the Anti-Microbial Resistance Action Plan Group in Northern Ireland which is part of their Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.  The HSE has also collaborated with Northern Ireland and the UK in a recent prevalence study on HCAIs and will continue to work together like this, where feasible, into the future.</P>
        <P>Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) are not new and are a challenge for all healthcare providers in all jurisdictions.  For centuries they have been a side effect of medical treatment, especially in hospitals. There are a number of types of HCAI, MRSA and Clostridium difficile are two such types. The more medical care a person requires, the more likely they are to develop a health care associated infection. These infections are, therefore, more common among people with serious illnesses or at high risk such as patients with a weakened immune system, patients who have been treated for leukaemia or cancer, or who have had an organ transplant.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE has been collecting data on MRSA for some time now.  In 2007, 43 Irish laboratories serving 64 acute hospitals (public and private) participated in their data collection system representing an estimated 98% coverage of the Irish population.  At present we do not have the relevant statistics for each individual hospital.  However the total number of MRSA cases recorded over the last five years was 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 592 cases in 2005, 588 cases in 2006 and 432 cases by the end of the 3rd Quarter in 2007.</P>
        <P>A National Surveillance System has recently been established by the HSE to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis on four key areas, to monitor HCAIs in our health system: Staphylococcus bacteraemia; Antibiotic consumption; Alcohol gel use; MRSA surveillance in Intensive Care Units.</P>
        <P>The data for 2006 is currently being finalised and a report will be released by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre in the near future.  This report will include rates of MRSA bloodstream infection, listed by individual hospital.  Data for 2007 will be available in early 2008 and MRSA bloodstream infection rates for all publicly funded hospitals will be published <Col N="663"/>quarterly thereafter. All of this will greatly assist in the monitoring of improvements in infection control.</P>
        <P>Clostridium difficile is not at present a notifiable disease and, as a result, it is difficult to quantify the extent of infection in the health care system.  However, Clostridium difficile infection was examined in the Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections in acute hospitals in 2006.  The survey found that thirty-six patients had Clostridium difficile representing 0.5% of patients studied.  My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, is actively considering the addition of a small number of diseases including Clostridium Difficile to the list of notifiable diseases. This will be finalised as soon as the EU issues a new list of case definitions.  In the meantime I am arranging that Clostridium Difficile be included as an organism which is notifiable under the category acute infectious gastroenteritis. This will in effect make Clostridium Difficile notifiable in the short term.</P>
        <P>The HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group, chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next three to five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in healthcare settings, and, in addition, will focus on reducing antibiotic use in Ireland.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.</P>
        <P>While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken here to reduce the rates of infection and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

        <P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to increase health service capacity through the development of services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of  general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.</P>
        <P>It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.</P>
        <P>The provision of the appropriate infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of primary care services is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors. These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years. I understand that the HSE has recently sought expressions of interest from the private sector for the provision of the Primary Care Team infrastructure, with the HSE proposing to enter into fixed term leases with such providers.</P>

        <P>In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.

	<P>Under the terms of the Health Act 2004, the Board of the Health Service Executive is the governing body of the HSE with authority to perform the statutory functions of the HSE.  The members of the Board are appointed by the Minister.</P>
        <P>In general terms, the Board of the HSE is empowered to appoint the Chief Executive Officer of the HSE, such CEO being recruited under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004. The Board may delegate such functions of the Executive as the Board sees fit to the CEO. The CEO also becomes a member of the Board on appointment as CEO by virtue of being CEO.</P>
        <P>The CEO is responsible to the Board of the HSE for the performance of his functions and the implementation of the Boards policies. The CEO is charged with the carrying on, the managing and the controlling of the administration and business of the HSE, and the performance of such other functions as are assigned to him by the Health Act or other statute, or as may be delegated to him by the Board under Section 18 of the 2004 Act.</P>
        <P>The Act empowers the CEO to delegate his functions to specified employees of the HSE acting under the general direction and control of the CEO, and in compliance with such directions, limitations and guidelines as are specified by the CEO.  The Act authorises further sub delegation by those specified employees to other specified employees, under the authorisation of the CEO.</P>
        <P>In practical terms, the CEO is served by a management team of nine National Directors who each head a specific management function e.g. the National Hospitals Office, Primary Community &amp; Continuing Care, Finance, Human Resources, Corporate Planning, Population Health etc.</P>
        <P>Each National Director is served in turn by their own management team of Assistant National Directors who each typically function in relation to a particular function or alternatively in relation to a geographical region of service provision, as appropriate. The National Hospitals Office is served by eight regionally based hospital networks.</P>
        <P>Section 6 of the Health Act, 2004 states that the Health Service Executive is a corporate body.  In view of this, the precise manner in which the general practitioners service, the out-patient service, community nursing and hospitals are managed together including the provision of an organisational chart, is a matter for the HSE itself.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and to respond directly to the Deputy.</P>

The most recent report from the HSE advises that, arising from the &euro;4.78 additional revenue funding for 2006, 44 additional staff dealing with cystic fibrosis have been appointed to date across a number of hospitals, including St Vincent&rsquo;s, Beaumont, Temple Street, Crumlin, Tallaght, Cork University Hospital, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that the &euro;2m additional revenue funding for 2007 will facilitate the recruitment of 23.5 additional staff dealing with cystic fibrosis services.  The necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.  My Department has asked the HSE to reply directly on the specific operational issues raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest> the reason children with cystic fibrosis cannot be allocated a medical card in their own right, even if their families do not apply; and if the costs involved in looking after the medical needs, travel, accommodation, sports facilities, and physiotherapy of the child are factored into the medical card application. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The assessment of eligibility to medical cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged over 70 who have an automatic entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants.  Under Section 45 of the Health Act, 1970 medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  This provision also entitles qualifying dependants to avail of a medical card.  The HSE may also grant a person full eligibility for a particular service, where the person would be unable, without undue hardship, to provide that service for themselves or their dependants.  In assessing an application for a medical card on behalf of a child, the HSE uses guidelines based on the means of the child&rsquo;s parent(s)/guardian(s), which includes their income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.  The assessment process also takes account of other factors, such as medical or social need, which may impact on their ability to meet the cost of GP services.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.  However, my Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.  As part of this exercise, a review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards in the context of financial, medical and social need is being undertaken and is expected to be completed by autumn 2008.</P>

Since the launch of the Health Repayment Scheme in August 2006, the HSE has informed my Department that it has under<Col N="670"/>taken extensive national and local media communication campaigns to ensure that potential applicants are made aware of the Scheme.  In addition, a series of nationwide road shows was undertaken to create awareness of the Scheme and to provide hands on support to applicants.</P>
        <P>The HSE also undertook a final publicity campaign in December 2007 which consisted of a national print advertising campaign, a national radio advertising campaign which included advertisements in the Irish Independent, Irish Times, Irish Examiner, Sunday World and Sunday Independent.  In addition, a regional media campaign resulted in press releases issued to the local print press and regional radio interviews on 20 stations.  In view of the various measures undertaken by the HSE/Scheme Administrator to maximise awareness of the scheme, I have decided not to extend the closing date for receipt of applications.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which will invest &euro;575 million over 5 years.  I understand that, in July 2007, the Group referred to was approved under the NCIP interim staffing support scheme for a start up grant of &euro;3,000 in respect of the period September to December 2007.  The interim scheme was introduced in 2007 to facilitate services which could not meet the contractual deadline applicable to the staffing support grant scheme under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), and pending the introduction of the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) in January 2008.</P>
        <P>With the closure in December 2007 of funding under the EOCP, community-based childcare services with a focus on disadvantage continue to be eligible for support funding under the CCSS, to which &euro;153 million in Exchequer funding has been allocated during 2008-2010.  Community childcare services funded under either the EOCP or interim NCIP staffing support schemes were eligible to apply under transitional arrangements introduced for the CCSS and the Group in question has been approved for funding of &euro;4,500 transitional funding in respect of the period January to June 2008.  All such transitional funding is calculated on a pro-rata basis on the previous level of staffing support funding for which approval was given.</P>
        <P>The Childcare Directorate of my Office has recently received an appeal from the Group in regard to the amount of transitional funding for which it has been approved.  This appeal has been copied to Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the NCIP on behalf of my Office, for examination and assessment.  Following Pobal&rsquo;s assessment of the application, which will include any new information provided in their appeal, it will be forwarded to the Childcare Directorate of my Office for final consideration and decision.  The Group will be notified of the outcome in due course.  Funding for the period post June 2008 will be based on the parent profiles submitted by the Group, on the same basis as other Groups funded under the scheme and details of CCSS were announced in December, 2007.</P>

	<P>The establishment of the Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL) predates the foundation of the State.  The lights service dates back to the 18th century. CIL was established in that name by the Dublin Port Act of 1867.  CIL has responsibility under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, an Act of the UK Parliament for the superintendence and management of all lighthouses and other aids to navigation in respect of the State and the adjacent seas and islands. The Merchant Shipping Act 1995 (UK) empowers the Commissioners with the same function for Northern Ireland and the adjacent seas and islands.</P>
        <P>The entire system of lights around the coasts of Britain and Ireland is administered as a single financial unit known as the General Lighthouse Fund (GLF). The GLF is controlled by the UK Department for Transport (DfT).  As a result, the three GLA&rsquo;s are under the aegis of the DfT.  Due to this unique link, the Aids-to-Navigation Section of the Department of Transport monitors, but does not control the activities of CIL.</P>
        <P>The Board of CIL comprises up to 16 Commissioners including the Lord Mayor of Dublin and 3 others nominated by Dublin City Council together with 12 co-opted members; these latter positions are filled by the Board as vacancies occur and 5 Executive members.  As Minister for Transport I have no role in the appointment of Commissioners.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 339 to 344, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) operates under a clear commercial mandate and its capital investment programme is funded from its own internal resources. The question of Exchequer funding for the DAA therefore does not arise.</P>
        <P>Proposals in relation to the development of Dublin Airport are, in the first instance, a matter for the DAA which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airport and to provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers.  Accordingly, the issue of cost benefit analysis in relation to proposed expansion projects at <Col N="674"/>Dublin Airport is a matter which falls within the responsibility of the management and board of the DAA.</P>
        <P>The DAA, of course, is required to comply with Chapter 10 of the NDP to the extent appropriate to a commercial SSB that will fund its capital expenditure programme from its own resources. Also responsibility for compliance with Department of Finance capital appraisal guidelines rests with the Board of the company.</P>
        <P>During the long and detailed planning processes for Terminal Two and the Second Parallel Runway, the DAA and its advisers engaged in extensive consultation with all stakeholders and complied with all planning and environmental analysis requirements.</P>
        <P>Finally, I would point that, in line with the Government decision of May 2005 mandating the DAA to build Terminal Two, independent experts have since reported on the specification and cost of Terminal 2.  The experts appointed by the Department concluded that the methodology, approach and execution of the planning objectives and considerations for passengers adopted by the DAA accords with best practice.  They also found that the estimated cost of the new terminal is within industry norms for this type of project in a European capital city.  The verification team report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  (<i>www.transport.ie</i>)</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 345 and 346 together.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that Dublin Airport has the capacity to expand to meet our aviation traffic needs for the foreseeable future. Because of the prudent policy of acquiring land banks in the environs of the airport to cater for future growth, the Dublin Airport Authority is now in the happy position of being able to undertake the second terminal and second runway on land it already owns.</P>
        <P>With traffic of 23 million passengers in 2007, Dublin Airport will remain the country&rsquo;s main airport serving the needs not just the needs of the travelling public in the surrounding counties but also of the country&rsquo;s tourism, business and freight sectors generally. The National Spatial Strategy has acknowledged that the expansion of air services from Dublin Airport to a wider range of destinations is essential in the interests of underpinning Ireland&rsquo;s future international competitiveness. Also, DAA has a commercial mandate to develop Dublin Airport and DAA is also required to comply with the Department of Finance capital appraisal guidelines, as appropriate to a commercial SSB. DAA has also received planning permission for the proposed second terminal and second runway.  Accordingly, the question of analysing the merits of an alternative second airport for Dublin does not arise at this juncture.</P>

The RPA has finalised arrangements with a consortium of local developers for the delivery of the project.  On 20th December 2007 the RPA submitted an application for a Railway Order for the project.  Subject to approval of the Railway Order, it is expected that construction will commence towards the end of 2008 and the new spur line is expected to be completed in 2010.</P>

	<P>My Department supports the use of the Port Tunnel by any bus operator, whether it is Dublin Bus, Bus Eireann or a private operator.  On the 22nd March, 2007, Dublin Bus notified my Department of its proposal to re-route four of its existing Route 41X services from Swords via the Port Tunnel. At that time, my Department advised the Company that the proposal was in conflict with a prior application from a private operator for a high frequency bus service from Swords to the City Centre via the Port Tunnel.  Therefore, in accordance with legislative procedures, Dublin Bus was advised that a decision on its proposal was being deferred until the prior application was finalised. At present, there are no services authorised to use the Tunnel on the 41X route. Applications from private bus operators and notifications from the State Companies are dealt with on a first come basis and Dublin Bus is aware of these procedures.</P>
        <P>The prior application was finalised and my Department issued a licence on the 3rd October, 2007 to the private operator concerned.  My Department is currently considering the Dublin Bus proposal taking into consideration the introduction of the newly licensed service and the matter has been the subject of ongoing contact with Dublin Bus.  An issue such as that which has arisen in relation to the Route 41X only occurs where my Department considers that the proposal conflicts with a prior application.</P>
        <P>My Department has previously approved Dublin Bus to operate the Route 33X (Skerries-City Centre) and Route 142 (Portmarnock- Malahide- City Centre-Rathmines) service via the <Col N="676"/>Port Tunnel. My Department has no other outstanding proposals from Dublin Bus for services from Swords that would utilise the Port Tunnel.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Under the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) launched in February 2007, thirty-four community transport groups around the country are being funded to address social exclusion in their rural areas arising from unmet public transport needs. Older people and people with disabilities form the core customer base of the RTP. Pobal, which administers the Programme on behalf of my Department, has commenced a process to extend the RTP on a phased basis with a goal of achieving nation-wide coverage in due course in line with Government policy. Indeed, I recently announced increased funding of &euro;2m for the RTP in 2008 to assist this process. Funding is also available to the Programme from the Department of Social and Family Affairs in respect of the Free Travel Scheme which applies to the RTP.</P>
        <P>The bottom-up approach developed during the pilot Rural Transport Initiative (2002-2006) demonstrated the effectiveness of the community and voluntary initiative and involvement in the provision of rural transport services.

	<P>Excellent and painstaking research by a number of independent groups and individuals continues in an effort to identify the precise location of the remains of Michael Larkin, William O&rsquo;Brien and William Allen, known collectively as the Manchester Martyrs.  Following their hanging on 23 November 1867, the remains of the three men were buried in Strangeways prison. To facilitate construction works in Strangeways in 1991, the remains of some sixty prisoners were exhumed and cremated, including those of the three men. The ashes were reburied in caskets at Blackley Cemetery. Researches to date have not expressly identified any of those remains as those of the three men. The British authorities have advised that there are no surviving records of prisoners buried in any of the Manchester gaols prior to 1880.</P>
        <P>Despite these difficulties, the independent groups and individuals continue their efforts to achieve a positive identification of the remains of the three, either individually or as a group. However, pending such positive identification, the question of repatriation to, and re-interment in, Ireland does not arise.  Officials in my Department have met with interested groups and, together with our Embassy in London, continue to monitor developments.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In implementing the &ldquo;Per Cent for Art&rdquo; scheme, which is based on an amount of up to 1% of capital cost, my Department generally calculates the percentage which it spends on artwork on the basis of the total annual cost of all capital construction projects, rather than as a percentage of each individual project.  On the other hand, a current example of a capital construction project where we are implementing the &ldquo;Per Cent for Art&rdquo; scheme on an individual project basis is the recently opened Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre on O&rsquo;Connell St. There, the provision of artwork is currently being considered with a projected budget of &euro;22,000, reflecting 1% of the capital expenditure.  My Department works closely with the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Office of Public Works in this area, who provide and maintain artwork for use in Missions abroad and at Headquarters.</P>

There are two systems in place as the financial management of the two is kept separate, to take account of different requirements and, in particular, the specific needs of the aid programme.  Both systems are versions of SUN software. They are provided by Core Financial Systems Ltd., under a contract awarded in January 2006, on the <Col N="680"/>basis of a competitive public tender process.

	<P>It is my firm view that if Ireland is to play a more active role in international conflict prevention and resolution, it will be necessary to mobilise the conflict resolution expertise that already exists in the country. Placing our experts within international agencies or in conflict related programmes and projects will allow Ireland to extend its reach on conflict resolution and contribute further to international efforts to resolve conflicts.</P>
        <P>Drawing on the very positive experience of the Irish Aid Rapid Response Corps, which has seen Irish expertise successfully deployed to the benefit of those suffering in humanitarian crises, I intend establishing a database of experts in conflict-related activities who are willing to be placed temporarily, under the aegis of the Government, with international agencies or in conflict related programmes and projects. I would expect that those involved will be drawn from a wide field of activities including peacekeeping, development, academic research and analysis.</P>
        <P>In setting up the database, my Department will of course consult with Irish people and organisations with expertise in this area. We will benefit from their experience, and the experience of setting up the Rapid Response Corps, in putting the process in place. Officials from my Department will also liaise with the international agencies with whom experts might be placed in order to determine international best practices in this regard.</P>

	<P>The Offaly Regeneration Company Ltd was established in May 2000. The purpose of the company is to promote and advance economic and social development generally in the Midland region, and, in particular, in County Offaly, including through close co-operation with partner bodies in the US, Canada and Northern Ireland. It is a registered company, with no share capital and limited by the guarantee of its founding shareholders. I understand that the board of the company, which is normally composed of 10 members, currently has a vacancy. As appointments to the board of directors are made by an AGM of the company, the vacancy on the board is expected to be filled at the next AGM. I do not hold any equity in the company, nor do I appoint any members of the Board.</P>
        <P>Atlantic Corridor is a registered business name of the Offaly Regeneration Company Ltd.  As I indicated in my written reply to Parliamentary Question number 231 on 13 February, the Government has provided funding to Atlantic Corridor, Ireland, via the Offaly Regeneration Company Ltd., which is the implementing agency for Atlantic Corridor, Ireland.  Atlantic Corridor Ireland, through its implementing agency, has been involved in promoting the development of the region in terms of business and education through North-South co-operation and international linkages.</P>

The Advisory Science Council is one of the bodies who are actively working with my Department to ensure that the objectives of the SSTI are realised.</P>

	<P>In 2007 the National Employment Rights Authority carried out 1,942 inspections/visits in relation to the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000.  The majority of the inspections/visits undertaken were part of a focused employment rights compliance inspection campaign in sectors covered by the National Minimum Wage.</P>
        <P>In 192 cases, breaches were detected for offences such as failure to pay the appropriate rate/ training rate under the Act, failure to keep records to show compliance with the Act, failure to keep records for 3 years as required by the Act.  No prosecutions have been initiated to date in respect of these breaches. Arrears of &euro;124,475 have been recovered to date.  Details are not available in relation to number of employees covered by these arrears.</P>
        <P>The primary role of the National Employment Rights Authority in the case of breaches of employment rights legislation, is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including redress for the employees concerned and payment of any arrears due to those employees.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that in the majority of cases employers rectify breaches of employment law and pay any arrears due to employees without prosecution. However, the National Employment Rights Authority reserves the right to initiate prosecutions in respect of breaches of certain employment legislation.</P>
        <P>Targeted campaigns, accompanied by awareness and promotional activities, will be a significant feature of National Employment Rights Authority&rsquo;s future employment rights compliance and information strategy.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware that Rights Commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission also hear complaints concerning breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.</P>

	<P>Since 1987, on the formation of Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited (IFI), a joint venture with ICI, Nitrigin Eireann Teoranta (NET) has acted as a holding company.  More recently, NET&rsquo;s primary role following the liquidation of IFI in 2002 has been to monitor the progress of that liquidation in the context of NET&rsquo;s claims on the liquidation.</P>
        <P>As mentioned in my recent response to the Deputy, (PQ No. 5332 refers), following the pay-out of the last substantial dividend to unsecured creditors during 2007 by the liquidator of IFI, it became clear that there would be no funds remaining in the liquidation to meet any liabilities to NET.  NET and ICI had previously agreed that any liabilities to them should be subordinated in favour of other unsecured creditors.  As overall unsecured creditors of IFI received 47.5% of their claims, there was no longer any meaningful role for NET.  As a consequence of this, measures were taken on 20 December 2007 to wind up NET as a members voluntary liquidation i.e. a solvent liquidation.</P>
        <P>The liquidator is currently carrying out the liquidation process. Given the absence of any business activity, privatisation of NET was not relevant.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to of the situation where a company (details supplied) is refusing to recognise union representatives for its workers from south of the border, while willingly dealing with union representatives for workers north of the border; and his views on whether this kind of double standard is a form of discrimination against Irish workers. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been established in a number of legal cases that the constitutional guarantee of freedom of association does not guarantee workers the right to have their union recognised for the purpose of collective bargaining.</P>
        <P>The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature.  In line with this voluntarist approach, a High Level Group comprising representatives from IBEC, ICTU, and various Government Departments and agencies and chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach was established under Partnership 2000 to consider proposals submitted by ICTU on the recognition of unions and the right to bargain.  This Group recommended that two distinct procedures be put in place for the resolution of disputes where negotiation arrangements are not in place and collective bargaining does not exist  &mdash; a voluntary procedure and a legislative fall back procedure.</P>
        <P>These recommendations were implemented through the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2000 (Statutory Instrument No. 145 of 2000) and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001.  These measures were improved by the introduction of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2004 (S.I. No. 76 of 2004), the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Victimisation) (Declaration) Order 2004 (S.I. No. 139 of 2004) and the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. The Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and S.I. No. 139 of 2004 contain specific protections for employees against victimisation as regards trade union membership or activity in situations where it is not the practice of the employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations, the internal dispute resolution procedures (if any) normally used by the parties concerned have failed to resolve the dispute and a trade union or an excepted body has taken steps to invoke the procedures under S.I. No. 76 of 2004.</P>
        <P>More generally, matters relating to discrimination come within the remit of my colleague Mr Brian Lenihan, TD, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, although I understand that the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2007 do not address the issue of discrimination in relation to trade union membership.</P>

	<P>While I may give general policy directives to the agencies under the Industrial Development Acts, the Enterprise <Col N="688"/>Development Agencies under the aegis of my Department have put in place a range of strategies, programmes and financial incentives to promote economic and enterprise development that will support sustainable employment throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is aggressively focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies who are setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions. Enterprise Ireland provides a range of supports for high potential start up companies including, financial supports, business and marketing advice, mentoring and product development.  Enterprise Ireland also supports the provision of incubation space for new start ups.</P>
        <P>The Forf&aacute;s Employment Survey 2006 shows that there are 347 Enterprise Ireland assisted companies located in South County Dublin providing over 11,000 full time jobs and over 1,000 part time jobs.</P>
        <P>South County Dublin is fortunate to have world class business parks such as Citywest and Grange Castle, all located adjacent to the main centres of population.  Major developments are taking place in all these locations and prospects for future quality employment in Tallaght are very good.</P>
        <P>The role of the South Dublin County Enterprise Board (CEB) is to provide support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level throughout South Dublin, which is inclusive of the Tallaght area. Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial and non-financial support. In 2007 full-time employment in South Dublin CEB client businesses located in the Dublin 24 region grew by 23 jobs.  128 people from businesses based in the Dublin 24 area took part in over 30 different management and capability development courses provided either directly or indirectly by South Dublin CEB.  11 clients based in Dublin 24 also took part in the Board&rsquo;s mentoring programme at a cost to the CEB of over &euro;23,000.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland continues to work with state agencies and other stakeholders to market Tallaght and all of South County Dublin for new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as well as encouraging existing FDI to expand. Grange Castle business park continues to attract high level FDI and the announcement in November that Microsoft Corporation has selected Grange Castle as the location for its new European data centre is a further indicator of Ireland&rsquo;s standing internationally as a global knowledge based economy. Microsoft plans to invest $500m in the construction of the data centre and will employ up to 75 people.  It is testament to IDA and South County Dublin&rsquo;s commitment to growing next generation businesses in the area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am aware that Tallaght has a very young population.  People have very good supports in the schools of Tallaght and an excellent Institute of Technology.  Tallaght is also supported by good infrastructure which attracts investment by foreign companies. I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies under the remit of my Department will continue to bear fruit in terms of  employment development for the Tallaght area.</P>

	<P>The management of the State&rsquo;s land banks for industrial development purposes are vested in IDA Ireland, who provide property solutions to its client companies and those of Enterprise Ireland, and in Shannon Development, who perform a similar role in the Shannon region.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is developing a regional network of strategic sites to attract sector specific investment as well as providing bespoke property solutions, at commercial rates, in its business parks and sites throughout the country.  This property programme is mostly funded from the Agency&rsquo;s own resources that are generated from property sales and lettings.</P>
        <P>In the past five years (2003 to 2007) a total of &euro;44.9m has been provided to IDA Ireland by way of Exchequer funding, through a Subhead in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment Vote.  This represents a relatively small proportion of the total cost of the programme over these years.  The agency holds a number of vacant properties for marketing purposes at any one time and there are costs associated with building and site maintenance.  Shannon  Development is a limited company and operates its land bank without state aid.</P>
        <P>The amount of land held by the agencies may vary from time to time depending on the prevailing economic circumstances.  The availability of tailored property solutions for existing or prospective clients is one important marketing tool for the Agencies.  The trend over recent years has been to consolidate holdings and to divest of properties deemed no longer suitable for promotion. In this connection an Expenditure Review of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Property Programme, which was led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and concluded in 2004, noted that the property programme was being managed efficiently and effectively by the Agency.  Furthermore, the Review noted with approval the largely self- financing nature of the property function and recommended that it be continued as a central part of financial planning within the Agency.  In addition, the Review approved of the Agency&rsquo;s policy of disposing of property solutions no longer needed while, at the same time, recognizing the Agency&rsquo;s need to have a set amount of property available for marketing at any one time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The management of the property programme is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agencies and not one in which I have a function.  Accordingly, the Deputy's query has been forwarded to the Secretary of IDA Ireland and the Secretary of Shannon Development for their attention.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 and 385 together.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  In the period 2003 to 2007 a total of 9,584 new jobs were created in the BMW Region.  The tabular statement (Table 1) shows the number of jobs created in each of the years in question.</P><Col N="691"/>
        <P>For the period 2000 to 2006 IDA Ireland set a high-level performance target for the Objective 1 (BMW) Area, which committed the Agency to work to deliver a target of 50% of all new Greenfield jobs to be located in the Objective 1 Area.  Despite difficult global trading conditions, substantial progress was achieved against this target and in that period 36% of all new Greenfield jobs were located in the area.  This represents a rolling average calculated over the seven-year period and these are shown for each year in Table 2.</P>
        <P>In recent years, Ireland has undergone a transformation from a low wage/low cost economy towards a high value and knowledge-based one.  Arising from this transformation, the nature of foreign direct investment (FDI) has changed and Ireland is now competing for premium mobile investments against the most advanced countries in the world.  A key aspect of the high value, knowledge intensive FDI, for which Ireland now competes, is that it increasingly favours locations in or near centres of urban scale, where it has access to the concentrations of infrastructure, skills and services it needs.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, IDA Ireland has aligned its strategy with the National Spatial Strategy (NSS).  In line with the NSS, IDA is focused on delivering investments to the Gateway and Hub locations nationally, and specifically those in the BMW region.  This strategy involves matching investor requirements with the competencies, infrastructure and critical mass of the Gateway and Hub locations to secure the maximum number of investment for Ireland.  The key sectors of focus for IDA are Life Sciences, Information and Communications Technologies and high value Services activities.  In this connection, it must be remembered that, under the revised EU Regional Aid Guidelines, the BMW and South East Regions are the only areas where Regional aid is available up to 2013.  Ultimately it is the investor who decided where to locate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent years IDA, because of Government policy, has supported the development of the BMW Region by substantially increasing the size and remit of its regional offices in the area.  Today, over 80 staff are based in its regional offices in Athlone and Sligo. Delivering regionally based innovative, world class property solutions is a priority for the Agency.  A successful example of this approach has been the delivery of an advance planning permission for a Biopharmaceutical facility in Oranmore, Co Galway.  This is a truly unique marketing resource and the first of its kind in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the policies being pursued by the Government, and Agency, together with the roll out of the National Development Plan, will continue to bear fruit in terms job creation and investment for the Region.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.</P>
        <P>At present there are 19 IDA supported companies in Mayo employing almost 3,000 people in permanent jobs and approximately 500 more in temporary and contract employment.  I am satisfied that the actions of the development agencies together with the continued roll out of the NDP will continue to bear fruit in terms of economic development for the people of the Mayo.</P>
        <P>In the past 5 years a total of 493 new jobs were created in IDA supported companies in County Mayo, which represents 1% of all new jobs created in IDA supported companies in the country in the same period.  The attached tabular statement sets out the number of new jobs created, by sector, in each of the years in question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Statistics in relation to investment in job creation are not maintained on a county - by -county basis.  IDA recognises the need to provide high value employment opportunities in the key towns in Mayo that provide sustainable long-term jobs.  In line with the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) the linked hub of Castlebar/Ballina and the town of Westport are priority locations for IDA and are being actively promoted for new FDI.  IDA is committed to the development of Mayo and is working continually with the existing client base to deepen the global strategic importance of the Irish operations within their parent corporations.  In addition, the Agency is investing significantly in the provision of planned and focussed property solutions in the county by developing world class Business and Technology Parks in Ballina, Westport, and Castlebar.  This is an essential marketing tool in the process of attracting potential new investors to the county.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 390 and 391 together.</P>
        <P>My Department provides capital grants for the development of arts and culture infrastructure around the country.  One of the conditions of this funding is compliance with the Per Cent for Art Scheme.  It is a condition of all capital arts funding that prior to the final grant payment being made project promoters must provide evidence of compliance with the terms of the scheme, subject to the limits set out in the guidelines.  Approximately &euro;477,000 has been spent on art commissioned under the scheme by 44 completed projects that have been grant aided under my Department&rsquo;s Arts Capital Scheme.</P>

	<P>I have been assured by South Dublin County Council that the Contractor is ready to resume the works on the stadium within weeks and it is hoped that the first phase can be completed before the end of this year at an estimated cost of &euro;9m.  Phase One will see the completion of the stand on one side of the pitch with a seating capacity of 3,000, the playing surface, changing rooms and showers and other amenities.  Officials from South Dublin County Council have met with officials from my Department to discuss the funding of the project.  My Department has already allocated grants of &euro;2.44m under the Sports Capital Programme to the development over the period 2000 to 2002.  I have recently announced a new round of the Sports Capital Programme and I understand that South Dublin County Council will be making an application for funding for the project under the Programme.  The normal terms and conditions of the Sports Capital Programme will apply to any successful application.</P>

	<P>In the Budget 2008, my Department was allocated &euro;1.5 million from the Dormant Accounts Funding under Subhead C7 of my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">This funding was part of &euro;42.75 million allocated in the 2008 Budget from the Dormant Accounts Fund across a range of Votes.  As I stated in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 109 of 12th February 2008, my colleague the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has overall responsibility for dormant accounts spending.  The funding through my Department is an element of a larger set of economic and social disadvantage funding measures including funding for persons with a disability.</P>
        <P>The 2008 special funding of &euro;1.5 million through my Department is to provide opportunities for persons with a disability to participate in sport and physical activity by way of the appointment of Sports Inclusion Development Officers in Local Sports Partnerships.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of my department by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive (HSE). </P>
        <P>Where the HSE becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement to meet housing costs, the supplement may be stopped and an overpayment may be raised. Any overpayment of rent supplement incurred in circumstances of this kind may be recoverable from the tenant. It is a matter for a Community Welfare Officer (CWO) of the HSE to determine if an overpayment should be raised and recovered, taking into account all of the circumstances of each particular case.  Where an overpayment is deemed to be recoverable, a CWO will make appropriate arrangements with the tenant for recovery of the overpayment.</P>
        <P>Available statistics do not specifically identify the number of people who have had deductions made from payments, where rent supplement was found not to have been paid over to a landlord. However, enquiries with the community welfare service suggest that the scale of this particular type of overpayment is not significant.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, which is administered by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), is designed to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </P>
        <P>Under the legislation governing the scheme, the HSE may make a single payment to meet an exceptional need to people on social welfare or health board payments. This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person&rsquo;s basic income.</P>
        <P>Assistance in the form of an Urgent Needs Payment (UNP) can be also made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA, to assist, for example in cases of flood damage with immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and perhaps shelter. Assistance can be provided to people affected, in cash or in kind.</P>
        <P>Over the past few months, flooding has been experienced in a number of areas of the country. My Department&rsquo;s role in supporting the response to the recent flooding primarily involves supporting the community welfare service in the provision of ENP and UNP funding in the short term and other supports where applicable to cater for the long-term effects of the flooding. Any support given relates to damage to a person&rsquo;s home or loss of essential items. It does not extend to business or commercial losses.  Local community welfare officers are available to provide assistance on an individual basis where that is warranted. If any person is experiencing hardship as a result of the recent flooding, they should contact their local Community Welfare Officer in the first instance.</P>

        <Quest> if, in relation to rent supplements payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, if his attention has been drawn to the rent ceiling on which supplement is based are entirely unrealistic in the current rental market and that this gives rise to a situation in which persons on very low incomes are obliged to make private arrangements with landlords for payment of higher rents in order to secure accommodation; if he will review the rent limits under the rent supplement scheme to take account of realistic rent levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on my behalf by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State. The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.  </P>
        <P>There are currently over 60,000 rent supplements in payment. Some 46,000 have been awarded since the current rent limits were set in January 2007.  This suggests that the limits are set at reasonable levels at present.</P>
        <P>Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels. This in turn <Col N="700"/>would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes, including people in low wage employment.  Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the HSE may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent limits. This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness</P>
        <P>In January 2007 a review was completed of the maximum levels of rent which a person may incur and still be eligible to receive rent supplement. The purpose of the review was to inform the process of setting new limits, applicable from January 2007 until 30 June 2008. The review included consultation with the HSE, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Central Statistics Office, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and voluntary agencies working in this area.  This process ensures that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country. Arising from the review, rent limits were adjusted upwards, from January 2007, for a number of household types in 14 counties.</P>
        <P>I intend to have rent limits reviewed this year with a view to implementing any revision found to be necessary, from 1 July 2008. A consultative approach will be used to conduct this review.</P>

	<P>Oracle Financials is the financial management system which produces the Departments two statutory accounts annually. These two accounts &mdash; the Appropriation Account and the Social Insurance Fund account &mdash; showed an annual outturn of &euro;7.3 billion and &euro;7.7 billion respectively for 2006, the last year for which full information is available. </P>
        <P>This financial system is used widely across the public and private sectors and supports the normal range of accounting functions such as General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Purchasing, Inventory and Fixed Assets. The system was initially acquired in 1998 at a cost of &euro;480,000.  The implementation was done by CFM following a competitive tendering process.   A separate query and reporting tool known as Business Objects was also implemented in tandem with Oracle Financials to provide management reporting facilities.</P>
        <P>The most recent annual software licence and support fee for Oracle Financials application and database software was &euro;60,000.</P>
        <P>The Oracle Financials system is monitored on an ongoing basis and has been upgraded regularly to keep up with emerging business needs. The most recent upgrade in 2006 was implemented at a cost &euro;235,000.</P>
        <P>The Department has a number of large-scale payment systems through which sixty two million payment transactions are generated annually. While these systems would include some financial accounting features, the payment and receipts data related to these payment systems is fed into Oracle&rsquo;s general ledger where all Departmental expenditure is brought to account and it is from the general ledger that the Department&rsquo;s annual accounts are produced.</P>

        <P>Currently some 50% of customers receive their payment electronically direct to their Post Office, bank or financial institution.  The remaining customers are paid by paper based payment instruments &mdash; cheques, post drafts or personal payment order books.</P>
        <P>The Department is implementing a three-year strategy to change paper based payment instruments to electronic payments at post offices and financial institutions.  The programme is being implemented on a phased basis to coincide with book renewal production schedules and as personalised payable order books expire.</P><Col N="702"/>
        <P>Concerns have been raised about the position of customers who use &ldquo;agents&rdquo; to collect their payments.  The Department is aware of these concerns and have put in place arrangements to continue using book payments in these cases.</P>
        <P>Customers who collect their payment at a post office will present their Social Services Card and sign for their payment in the normal way.  Payments can be collected up to 60 days after the due date in the case of pensioners and up to 100 days for child benefit recipients.  Certain other customers have 20 days to collect their payment which is considered to be the optimum time for collection of a weekly means based payment.

        <P>Section 25 of the Disability Act, 2005 requires that all public buildings be fully accessible by 2015 and that they at least meet the minimum standard as set out in Part M of the Building Regulations, 1997 &mdash; 2006. The Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan (as required by section 31 of the Act) sets out an Action Plan in this regard. This Plan provides for a programme of formal access audits all of our buildings including in Co. Mayo. Since 2006, fifteen such audits have been undertaken but none as yet in the Mayo area. Audits of the ten offices in County Mayo will be carried out in due course.</P>
        <P>My Department is reliant on the Office of Public Works (OPW) to commission these audits and to undertake any works of a substantive nature which are recommended in the subsequent reports. The OPW also manage the allocation of funds for this work. My Department is working closely with the Office of Public Works with a view to meeting the targets set down in the Sectoral Plan.  I would like to add that most of my Department&rsquo;s Offices meet a basic standard of physical accessibility. In addition, my Department is continually upgrading its facilities and where offices are found to be totally unsuitable for their purpose there is a replacement programme in place. In relation to those offices which are currently inaccessible, alternative arrangements are made, where necessary, to accommodate individual accessibility requirements.</P>

	<P>Translation services are provided for all languages and the majority of requests relate to supporting documentation for use in claims processing.  The Department of Foreign Affairs provides a translation service for a number of EU languages.  Requests for all other languages are sent to translation companies.  In 2007 over 1,100 documents required translation into a number of different languages excluding Irish.</P>
        <P>Response times can vary depending on the number of requests on hand at that time and the language required.  The average time for translations completed in 2007 was approximately six weeks.  The impact of translation time can vary but in the main does not lead to undue delay in processing claims.</P>
        <P>My Department makes every effort to source the translation of documents as quickly as possible in order to avoid any delays.</P>

	<P>The Community Development Programme provides financial assistance to some 180 Projects nationally.  These projects operate local resource centres or provide services aimed at addressing the problems faced by communities caused by poverty and disadvantage. Funded Projects meet the needs of women and children, those with disabilities, the homeless, lone parent families, the elderly, the unemployed, young people at risk, Travellers and other disadvantaged groups. </P>
        <P>As part of the current programme support, the Department publicly tendered for the provision of support services to Projects in 2004.  Six companies, including Framework, were chosen following a public tender process to provide services on a regional basis for the period June 2004 to end May 2007.  These contracts were extended, initially, to the end of 2007, and then, to the end of May 2008, in order to complete a consultation process with Projects on the future of the Programme.  The Department is considering the results of this consultation process and developments under other Government programmes targeting disadvantaged people.  Some improvements identified by Projects have already been implemented, including allowing Projects to have a greater say on procuring support and training appropriate to their own needs.  As part of the development of a new Programme, arrangements for the provision of future support services for Projects are under consideration.  My Department recognises the value of support services and is considering the best way to enable Projects, at this stage of their development, to access support services that best meet their needs.</P>

	<P>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) scientific advice is that the stock of spurdog is depleted, that there should be no targeted fishery for spurdog and that the by-catch in mixed fisheries be reduced to the lowest possible level.  On the basis of this advice, Council Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 provides for a 5% by-catch limit for spurdog/dogfish for all community vessels up to a maximum of 390 tonnes for the year in Ireland&rsquo;s case.  In effect this means that Irish vessels may not retain onboard an amount of spurdog/dogfish in excess of 5% of the live weight of the total catch retained on board.  The total amount of spurdog/dogfish landed by Irish vessels may not exceed 390 tonnes in 2008.</P>

	<P>Co-operation in the development of an all-island animal health and welfare strategy has progressed through the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) and by a number of working groups which continued to meet during the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The following decisions on cross Border co-operation in animal health and welfare were taken at an NSMC Agriculture Sectoral meeting on 9th November 2007.</P>
<P>The Council</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />recognised the important work that has been undertaken to develop an all-island Animal Health and Welfare Strategy;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />noted the all-island Animal Health and Welfare Strategy paper developed by the North/South Animal Health and Welfare Steering Group and which includes a list of initial activities for delivery of key elements of the strategy with various milestones and deadlines for the immediate period ahead;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />agreed that the way forward is through co-operation and the development of complementary policies;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />agreed that the free movement of animals on the island continues to be the ultimate aim of an animal health and welfare strategy; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />requested officials to continue to oversee progress on delivery of the initial activities of the Strategy and to identify further issues to progress the Strategy for approval at the next NSMC sectoral meeting.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In relation to co-operation on food safety, the Food Safety Promotion Board, safefood, was set up under the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999.  It has a statutory remit with respect to food safety on the island of Ireland including promotion; research; communication of food alerts; surveillance of food borne diseases; promotion of scientific co-operation and linkages <Col N="722"/>between laboratories; and the provision of an independent assessment, through independent scientific advice, of the safety and hygiene of food produced, distributed or marketed on the island of Ireland.  Since its establishment safefood has undertaken a number of extensive programmes which seek to further enhance food safety knowledge and increase capacity building across the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the exercise of its functions safefood works closely with the competent authorities in Ireland and Northern Ireland, namely the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and Food Standards Agency, respectively.  Through various programmes and projects safefood has collaborated with, and built strong relationships with, the respective Departments of Agriculture on the island. safefood has a corporate philosophy of adding value to the activities of other stakeholder bodies in the food chain and liaises with departments of Environmental Health in both jurisdictions, industry as well as consumer bodies.</P>
        <P>The conditions for import into the EU of live animals and products of animal origin from third countries are harmonised under EU Regulations and are being applied in both Ireland and N. Ireland.  Imports may only enter the territory of EU through Border Inspection Posts (BIP) approved by the EU where veterinary inspection controls are applied.  Moreover imports are permitted only from approved and listed third countries, or regions of those countries and, in the case of animal products, from approved export establishments.  The EU rules have also harmonised the import veterinary certification requirements.</P>
        <P>Having satisfied the entry control at a BIP imports are then free to move in intra-community trade.  The Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) of the European Commission carries out audits the operation of controls in the Member States, and in third countries, and publishes reports of its findings on its website.  There is dialogue between the services operating EU import controls.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 477 and 478 together.</P>
        <P>The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 in respect of port companies and harbour authorities governed by the Harbours Acts 1946, 1996 and 2000 and any other harbour or harbour related developments intended for commercial trade, and for all energy developments (including oil, gas, wave, wind and tidal energy) and aggregate and mineral extraction developments on the foreshore would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.  In the interim, all foreshore functions under the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2005 rest with my Depart<Col N="723"/>ment.  My Department will carry forward responsibility for all other foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933, including in respect of all aquaculture developments and piers and harbours, other than in respect of port companies and harbour authorities governed by the Harbours Acts 1946, 1996 and 2000 and any other harbour or harbour related developments intended for commercial trade.</P>
        <P>The Statement of Strategy 2005-2007 of the former Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources indicated that procedures would be developed for enhanced coordination and cooperation between the wide range of public bodies responsible for management of the coastal zone.  This was in response to the increasing demands and pressures on coastal areas and their resources.</P>
        <P>A consolidation and streamlining of the Foreshore Acts has also been proposed.  This is intended to provide a modern, effective and integrated legal framework for the management of the State&rsquo;s foreshore estate in the future.  Preparation of these proposals is intended to take account, among other things, of the principles in the EU Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management, the outcome of the EU Maritime Green Paper and the EU Marine Strategy Directive.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will clearly assume a critical role in these proposals.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the context of progressing the various elements required to develop the appropriate coastal zone legislative framework.  Any such consolidation and streamlining of the Foreshore Acts will be subject to a full Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA).</P>
        <P>Regulatory Impact Analysis is a tool used to assess the likely effects of a proposed new regulation or regulatory change.  It involves a detailed analysis to ascertain whether or not the new regulation would have the desired impact.  It helps to identify any possible side effects or hidden costs associated with regulation and to quantify the likely costs of compliance on the individual citizen or business.  As part of the RIA process of assessing the impacts, all stakeholders will have the opportunity to submit a response. These submissions will form part of the RIA, which will be a public document.</P>

	<P>My Department is the regulatory authority with responsibility for enforcement of a wide range of EU and national legislation governing primary production and processing in the agri-food sector, including animal health and welfare, plant health and fisheries activities.  My Department also carries out control and inspection activities in relation to food safety and consumer protection requirements on the basis of a service level agreement with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and is responsible for the control and inspection functions in relation to obligations imposed on the beneficiaries of EU funded and co-funded schemes such as the Single Farm Payment.  A large number of the Department&rsquo;s staff are engaged in the regulatory activity, many of whom have other duties, and it is not possible to isolate the operating budget for this type of activity.  The full administrative budget for my Department in 2006 and 2007 was &euro;281.2 million and &euro;296.4 million respectively (including the fisheries administrative budget expenditure from 19 October 2007).  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority is the regulatory authority with responsibility for the enforcement of regulations on sea fisheries protection and seafood safety.  The Authority, which is funded through my Department&rsquo;s Vote, was established in January 2007.  The operational costs in 2007 were &euro;10.9 million.</P>

Negotiations between the National Development Finance Agency, which is responsible for the procurement of the school, and MPFI are ongoing.  It is envisaged that the contract will be signed with the next few months.  If the negotiations are successful MPFI will be granted a licence to build and then operate the four schools for 25 years.  All four schools will remain in public ownership.  MPFI will receive no payments until the four schools have been completed and are in operation.  Unitary payments will then be paid on a monthly basis for the duration of the contract and will be subject to deductions if required. No tax incentives, special initial or final payments are being provided to MPFI.</P>

        <P>During the period of the last National Development Plan 2000-2006 my Department accelerated the school building programme with record levels of investment and the streamlining of delivery systems.  An aggregate total of well over &euro;2.6 billion was invested in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second level.  This programme delivered over 7,800 building projects.  The overall investment in school building infrastructure over the lifetime of the new NDP will be &euro;4.5 billion, including almost &euro;600 million for the school building programme in 2008.  Details of the number of projects funded by my Department at first and second level from 2002 to 2007 are given in the tabular statement that follows this reply.  The statistics sought by the Deputy regarding the percent for art scheme are not readily available.  However, I assure the Deputy that my Department supports and encourages schools with large-scale school building projects to utilise the scheme.</P>

	<P>Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools.  My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that the schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Acts.  However, in formulating an admissions policy a school must ensure it is lawful.  In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a student, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a student.  The National Educational Welfare Board is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a <Col N="727"/>school place for their child.  The board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no plans to establish a taskforce on school accommodation needs.  As the Deputy will be aware the Programme for Government commits my Department to establishing a Developing Areas Unit to liaise with Local Authorities, to identify where new schools are needed and to ensure that these schools are delivered in the fastest possible timeframe.  Initial work on establishing and assigning dedicated staff to the Unit began in the latter part of 2007 and it is now fully operational.  In terms of its work programme for 2008, the Developing Areas Unit is advancing the delivery of 30 new primary schools which are planned to be in place for September 2008.   These projects are being delivered in areas which have been identified as areas of rapid population growth.  I announced the details of the individual projects recently.  To deliver its 2008 programme, the Developing Areas Unit has been working closely with relevant Local Authorities on the acquisition of sites and on general pre-planning issues.  Project Managers, together with architectural, engineering and quantity surveying services were recruited from the private sector in October 2007 to prepare the planning applications, undertake the necessary surveys and oversee the delivery of the schools on each site.  Sites for each of the projects have been identified and site master-plans have been developed by the technical teams.</P>
        <P>An EU tendering process to establish a drawdown contract for the off-site construction of permanent and temporary accommodation had a closing date of 2 January 2008 and has now been completed.  Planning Applications have been lodged for virtually all of the schools.  The successful tenderers for the construction of each individual project have been notified and the programme is on target.  When taken with a number of other projects in developing areas involving extensions to existing schools, approximately 9,000 additional school places will be provided for September 2008.  In the meantime, the Forward Planning Section of the Department is identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be needed for 2009 and onwards.  This is also being done in close consultation with local authorities.  The Forward Planning Section&rsquo;s findings will likewise feed into the Developing Areas Unit for delivery.  My Department is satisfied that the approach which it is now taking to the identification and delivery of extra school places in rapidly developing areas will ensure that those places will be provided when and where they are needed.</P>

The Teaching Council has made significant progress on a number of fronts, most notably in establishing and maintaining a register of teachers, processing applications for entrance on to same, determining qualifications for registration, publishing codes of professional conduct for the teaching profession, establishing a research policy, awarding research bursaries, advising the Minister on various matters including the standards of educational qualification required to enter programmes of teacher education, professional development and teacher supply, and promoting the teaching profession generally.  Some sections of the Act have not yet been commenced.  My Department is working closely with the Teaching Council to ensure that it is in a position to fully discharge the relevant functions in advance of the commencement of the corresponding sections of the Act.  The remaining sections will be commenced when it is feasible to do so.  My Department continually monitors the situation in relation to retirements, demographics and the many other factors affecting supply and demand of teachers, in the light of system needs and available resources.  I am satisfied that my Department will take the necessary steps to enable the future demand and need for teachers to be met.  The Deputy might be interested to note that, in this context, my Department approved an additional 210 places for the current intake to the Postgraduate Diploma in Education (Primary), commencing February 2008.</P>

	<P>The scheme of secondment is designed to facilitate the temporary release of a permanent teacher from his or her teaching post.  The procedures for secondment arrangements are set out in Department Circular 11/02.  Under these arrangements a Board of Management, in framing a policy position on secondments, is required to ensure that the welfare and educational needs of pupils take precedence over all other considerations.  The Board of Management must ensure that a fully qualified temporary replacement teacher can be obtained to replace the teacher on secondment.  The terms of the secondment arrangement referred to by the Deputy allow for secondment to an outside organisation, in this case a College of Education, for a maximum <Col N="730"/>period of five years.  I regard this five-year period as an appropriate balance between the needs of the individual schools from which staff are seconded from and outside organisations &mdash; in this case a College of Education.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>For young parents of schoolgoing age, the most pressing issues are considered to be a sensitive response to their needs, appropriate counselling, mentoring and medical assistance, minimum disruption of tuition, and appropriate access to child care.  Individual circumstances will differ and accordingly, school management practice will vary from case to case.  Generally, when it comes to the attention of the school that a pupil is pregnant, the school authorities check to ensure that the girl is receiving appropriate medical assistance and counselling advice.  Schools endeavour to be sensitive and understanding to the girl&rsquo;s needs while trying to ensure that her education is not neglected.  Home tuition is provided to pregnant schoolgirls who are absent from school during the later stages of pregnancy or immediately following the birth of a baby when attendance may be impractical.</P>
        <P>Funding has been committed in 2008 for the education element of eight Teenage Parenting Support projects as a specific gender element of the School Completion Programme under DEIS in preventing early school leaving among teenage mothers.  Links have been established between local School Completion projects in these areas, assisted by the SCP National Co-ordination Team and the Teenage Parenting Support Initiative Co-ordinators.  The aim of these projects is to enable young women who are pregnant and young mothers to stay in second level education and to progress on to third level education or training.  The Project does this by providing individual support, information and grinds where necessary.  Young people participating in Parenting Support Programmes are targeted in-school, out-of-school and in higher/further education, giving them the opportunity to reach their full potential through continued participation in education and training.  This will improve their life opportunities and reduce the likelihood of the young family experiencing poverty and social exclusion and being long-term dependants on State support.  Single parents are target groups of two Further Education programmes, the Back to Education Initiative and the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme.  Grants towards the cost of child care are given to VECs to be used to assist with the provision of child care support for learners in the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme, Youthreach, Senior Traveller Training Centres and in the Back to Education Initiative.  The aim of this support is to attract people whose attendance is prevented by child care <Col N="731"/>responsibilities to enrol on these programmes.  Parents and guardians generally may avail of these grants.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives funded by the Department acknowledge the additional costs encountered by lower income students, including those with children, and support their participation in higher education.  Major improvements have been made by this Government in both the income limits for eligibility and the actual grant levels for third level student support.  This includes the introduction of the special rate of maintenance grant.  The highest rate of this grant is now at a record level of &euro;6,690 for the 2007-08 academic year &mdash; compared with just over &euro;2,000 in 1996-97.  To qualify for a special rate of maintenance income must be below a specified income threshold and the household income must include an eligible social welfare payment.  The One-parent Family payment and the Back to Education Allowance, payable by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, are eligible payments for the special rate of maintenance grant.  It should also be noted that both the One-parent Family payment and the Back to Education Allowance are excluded in the calculation of reckonable income for both the standard and special rate of maintenance grant.</P>
        <P>The ESF aided Student Assistance Fund continues to be a vital avenue of financial support for students experiencing financial difficulties in third level institutions, assisting with such supports as rent, child care and food costs.  A gross allocation of &euro;6.219 million will be made in the current academic year for this fund.  Some 9,886 students benefited from the Student Assistance Fund in 2005-6.  In 2005 some institutions reported that up to 60% of their students were drawing on the Student Assistance Fund to meet child care costs incurred while they were in higher education.  The Millennium Partnership Fund continues to support students from disadvantaged areas with regard to retention and participation in further and higher education.  Contribution to the costs of child care for student parents is a key expenditure area of the Fund.  The find, which is currently running at approximately &euro;2 million per annum, is allocated to community partnerships and partnership companies participating in the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme.</P>
        <P>Greater affordability of child care, linked to the creation of additional child care places, has been a key principle in both the previous and current National Development Plans. This Government has provided unprecedented levels of funding for child care in recent years.  Some &euro;499.3 million was allocated to the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-2006 and some 41,000 places will have been created by the time the programme finishes.  Child care provision will continue to attract substantial investment under the new national child care investment programme 2006-10.  Some &euro;575 million has been allocated to the new programme, which will be administered by the Office of the Minister for Children and aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care services by supporting the creation of an additional 50,000 places.  This Government also introduced the Early Childhood Supplement of &euro;1,000 per child under six to help parents with child care costs.</P>
        <P>A large number of third level institution also provide cr&egrave;che facilities, child care facilities while others have cr&egrave;ches adjacent to the campus.  A number of Higher Education institutions were approved for grants for child care facilities under the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-06, which is administered by the office of the Minister for Children.  All the above initiatives support single parents to continue their studies at third level.  The Government discussion paper, &ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents,&rdquo; put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of child care; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.  A sub-group of the <Col N="732"/>Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion, on which my Department is represented, is currently working on an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations.  Work on the development of this implementation plan is progressing.  Issues including access to child care support, education, training and activation measures continue to be discussed with the relevant Departments and Agencies.  In this regard, my Department is co-operating with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Office of the Minister for Children and F&Aacute;S in testing the non-income activation proposals in Coolock in Dublin and in Kilkenny.</P>

	<P>A total of 450 local HSCL coordinators provide HSCL services to 691 schools (370 Primary and 281 Post primary), with an additional 80 posts made available in 2006 to extend Home School Community Liaison services to all schools selected to participate in DEIS, the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, that did not have such services.  I also extended my commitment to schools not selected to participate in DEIS but already in HSCL scheme, to continue to support these schools in their efforts to deal with educational disadvantage among their students in line with both their size and level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>HSCL coordinator posts are provided on a full time or shared basis between schools and must be deployed to do full-time liaison duties.  For the first time, posts are shared across the two sectors &mdash; primary &amp; post primary level, to facilitate local HSCL coordinators working with the families of disadvantaged children.  My Department is currently undertaking a full review of Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) clustering arrangements in all schools participating in the scheme to ensure that all schools have a level of service which commensurates with both the size of the school as well as its relative level of disadvantage.  Any changes made in the HSCL clustering arrangements, which will take effect from 1 September 2008, will be notified to schools shortly.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of my position on the issues of litigation in special educational needs and can be assured that neither I nor my Department take lightly any decision to defend cases concerning children with special educational needs.  I should emphasise that my Department does not initiate any such proceedings and cases are generally only litigated where no potential settlement is acceptable to both sides and the Government&rsquo;s authority to decide issues of policy is in question.  The State has an obligation under the Constitution to provide for primary education.  In the context of children with special educational needs, that education must be appropriate to their requirements.  The State decides on an appropriate form of provision, having regard to the advice available to it from relevant experts in the National Educational Psychological Service, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Inspectorate and independent experts.  The Department is not complacent in dealing with these cases and attempts, wherever possible, to reduce the potential for litigation and the levels of legal costs where they arise.</P><Col N="736"/>
        <P>I would like to emphasise that legal costs incurred by the State in defending those cases which are brought to court, are not met directly by my Department.  In accordance with financial procedures in cases involving damages or compensation against the State, costs are generally charged to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office Vote as sanctioned by the Attorney General.  With reference to the costs incurred by my Department which are payment of legal costs of solicitors acting on behalf of children with special educational needs the costs for the last five years are as follows:</P>

        <Quest> the number of schools that have been granted temporary recognition by her Department; the names of the schools concerned; the length of time that the temporary recognition status has applied; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available.  However, if the Deputy has a query in relation to a specific school he can contact my officials in the Department who will be happy to assist in this regard. In general new schools initially operate with provisional recognition from my Department.  During the period of provisional recognition, it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation.  This accommodation must be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and my Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation.  While schools with temporary recognition do not qualify for capital funding, my Department does provide grant aid for the rental of interim accommodation.  It is open to a school to seek an increase in this rental as its needs develop.</P>
        <P>The following are the criteria for recognition of new primary schools, There must be evidence that:</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />The proposed school meets a need that cannot reasonably be met within existing provision.</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />The local community is consulted in advance.</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />The patron has been registered as such by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />A board of management will be appointed in accordance with the requirements of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />The Rules for National Schools will be complied with.</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />The proposed school has a minimum initial enrolment of 17 junior infants and a minimum projected enrolment of 51 pupils for the third year of operation.</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />All pupils are at least four years of age on 30 September of the year in which the school is due to commence operation.</P><Col N="737"/>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />The school will follow the Primary School Curriculum of my Department.</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />The school will employ recognised primary school teachers.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">A school may apply for permanent recognition when it has complied with all the conditions of temporary recognition.  The period of temporary recognition may vary from school to school.</P>

	<P>An agreement was reached by the respective Patrons to rationalise provision of post-primary provision in the town referred to by the Deputy to establish a single boys&rsquo; and a single girls&rsquo; school.  The actual amalgamation in each case is dependent on the availability of suitable accommodation.  In relation to the Girls school it is proposed to provide a new school on a new site.  The OPW, which acts on behalf of my Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, is considering a number of site proposals with the intention of acquiring a suitable site to facilitate the development of a new school building.  In relation to the Boys school the Patron has offered to provide a site to accommodate the new school.  As soon as these site issues are finalised, the building projects required to deliver the appropriate accommodation will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Enrolment policies in individual schools are the responsibility of the schools&rsquo; management authorities and provision is made for this under Section 15 of the Education Act 1998.  While schools are required to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, regard must also be had to the ethos of the school and the preference of parents.  Last December I announced further details of a new model of patronage at primary school level to be piloted from September 2008.  The new community national school model reflects the impact of growing diversity in Irish society on the traditional structures for primary education provision.  The model will aim to cater for the wishes of parents for denominational, multi-denominational and non-denominational education within the framework of a single patron model and single board of management structure.  The pilot schools will be open to children of all religions and none and will aim to provide for religious education and faith formation during the school day for each of the main faith groups represented.  A general ethics programme will also be available for children whose parents opt for that and the schools will operate through an ethos of inclusiveness and respect for all beliefs, both religious and non-religious.  The model is not intended to replace the existing patron models but to provide an additional option, likely to be used particularly in growing areas.  Three schools will be included in the initial pilot under the patronage of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee (VEC).  The implementation of the new pilot patronage model has involved, and will continue to involve, consultations with the main patron bodies, management bodies and education partners.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, one of the functions of the Board is to conduct and commission research into the reasons for non-attendance on the part of students <Col N="753"/>and into the strategies and programmes designed to prevent it. Ongoing activities of the Board include the development of a Code of Behaviour Guidelines and Attendance Strategies for Schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As detailed in my earlier response on this matter analysis of data for Co Mayo in 2004/05 indicates that in the Primary Sector 9.2% of pupils were absent for 20 days or more, while at Post Primary level the corresponding figure was 17.1%.  These figures compare favourably with the national average for pupils absent for more than 20 days which is 10% at primary level and 18.8% at post primary level.  I am informed by the NEWB that there is currently one Educational Welfare Officer assigned to the Mayo area and that an extra half post is to be allocated to the area pending the completion of the recruitment process currently under way for the 15 additional posts allocated to the Board last year.</P>
        <P>This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education.  It must be remembered also that the service provided by the NEWB is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to support schools, families and young people themselves.  In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and the provision of breakfast and homework clubs.</P>
        <P>In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 620 staff within the education sector in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The School Completion Programme (SCP) is a preventative measure designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving.</P>
        <P>School attendance is a central objective of SCP with targeted interventions for children at risk of early school leaving through a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school.  These supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time.  The Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) works to involve parents in their children&rsquo;s education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education.</P>
        <P>Work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration.  This approach aims to develop the delivery of services in a cohesive way and ensure that optimum use is made of all resources deployed including the resources of the NEWB.</P>

	<P>Under the Lisbon Convention and the EU Directive on Mutual Recognition of professional qualifications, Ireland is committed to giving appropriate recognition to qualifications from other countries.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, the teaching profession is regulated for the purposes of employment as a teacher.  EU Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications came into force on 20th October 2007 and ensures that professionals from any of the EU member states proposing to enter a regulated profession will have their qualifications and experience recognised appropriately.  The Teaching Council of Ireland is the competent authority for the regulation of the <Col N="755"/>teaching profession in Ireland and holds the register of teachers approved to teach in publicly funded schools in the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a general principle, persons recognised to practice a regulated profession in their Member State of origin must be given recognition to practice that profession in a host EU Member State.  However if there are shortfalls or significant gaps in the applicant&rsquo;s qualifications or experience <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> those required in the host Member State, the host State may require a compensatory measure &mdash; either an aptitude test or an adaptation period under supervised practice which addresses the shortfall.

	<P>With the launch of DEIS (the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion) in 2005, my Department has redoubled its efforts in addressing the challenging issues of social exclusion and educational disadvantage.  The social partnership agreement Towards 2016, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-16 and the social inclusion chapter of the National Development Plan provide an integrated and cohesive strategic focus for developing and implementing policies to tackle such issues and aim to ensure effective and joined-up delivery of social inclusion programmes and services.  They also adopt a lifecycle approach in addressing issues of social exclusion, including educational disadvantage, in the context of a ten year framework.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The long term perspective of these developments includes the setting of realistic high-level goals, their focus on the lifecycle and on coherent and integrated responses that can be effectively monitored.  They effectively provide the framework for addressing the key educational and social challenges that individuals face and the supports available to them at each stage in the lifecycle.</P>
        <P>The various intervention measures of the past 15 years have focused in particular on providing additional human and financial resources to address such issues as early education, literacy, the role of the family and the community in education and the problems associated with early school leaving.  In addition there have been significant supports put in place for back to education initiatives, adult literacy, youth and greater access to further and higher education.</P>
        <P>The DEIS action plan for educational inclusion both prefigured and is an integral part of the new integrated approach being adopted at national level to address problems of social exclusion and disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The action plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme.  DEIS brings together, and builds upon, a number of existing supports in schools where there is a concentrated level of disadvantage.  DEIS represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem and adopts a multi-faceted and more integrated approach.</P>
        <P>Also central to the success of the action plan will be an increased emphasis on planning at school and school cluster level, target-setting and measurement of progress and outcomes to <Col N="756"/>ensure that the increased investment is matched by an improvement in educational outcomes for the children and young people concerned.</P>
        <P>The DEIS action plan, which is being implemented over a five year period to 2010, addresses many of the issues raised by the correspondent.  The plan is comprehensive in its approach to early education, transition from primary to second-level, the role of the family and community, literacy and numeracy, attendance and early school leaving, teacher retention and development and the active participation of children in their own development.</P>

In discharging its responsibility under the Per Cent for Arts Scheme, my Department has commissioned the artist Brian King to design A National Memorial to Members of the Defence Forces who died in Service.

	<P>In the Headline Goal 2010, the EU set itself the objective inter alia, of being able &ldquo;to respond with rapid and decisive action applying a fully coherent approach to the whole spectrum of crisis management operations covered by the Treaty on the European Union&rdquo;.  A key element of the Headline Goal is the capability to deploy forces at high readiness, broadly based on the Battlegroups concept.  A Battlegroup is designed to respond rapidly either as a standalone force, as an initial stabilisation force for larger follow-on operations, or as a reinforcing force.  It comprises approximately 1,500 personnel with a readiness to deploy within 5 to 10 days after the decision to launch an operation is taken.  It is deployable for up to 120 days at a distance of up to 6,000 kilometres from Brussels.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the EU Battlegroups is to undertake operations (commonly referred to as the Petersberg Tasks which are set out in the Amsterdam Treaty) such as rescue tasks, tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking, in addition to peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks.  Battlegroups could be deployed on operations at the higher end of the Petersburg spectrum &mdash; i.e. robust peacemaking and high intensity combat operations.</P>
        <P>In November 2006, the Government formally approved the arrangements for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Nordic Battlegroup (NBG).  The other members of the Nordic Battlegroup are Sweden, Norway, Finland and Estonia. The Nordic Battlegroup will be on standby until 30 June 2008.  Due to the very nature of an EU Battlegroup it is very hard to give the full extent of possible locations to which EU Battlegroups or RAPID response forces could expect to be deployed.</P>
        <P>The participation in a Battlegroup operation remains a national sovereign decision, which is made on a case-by-case basis.  In the event that Ireland was to participate in a Nordic Battlegroup operation, we would be the only participant with a legal requirement for a UN Mandate.  However, many Member States acknowledge that it would be politically desirable, if not a political imperative, to have a UN Mandate for any Battlegroup deployment.</P>

	<P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 31 December 2007, as advised by the military authorities, was 10,434. This comprises 8,512 in the Army, 845 in the Air Corps and 1,077 in the Naval Service.</P>
        <P>It is intended to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at a level required to meet military needs and as set out in the White Paper i.e. 10,500 Permanent Defence Force all ranks. The Government remains fully committed to the policy of ongoing recruitment to ensure that an overall PDF strength of 10,500 is maintained.</P><Col N="760"/>
        <P>The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements. The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships. All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies.</P>
        <P>The Naval Service provides a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s obligations as a member of the European Union. The Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Fishery Limits. At present, fishery protection activity accounts for roughly 90% of all Naval Service patrol time. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels may be deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue, drug interdiction operations and assistance with pollution control.</P>
        <P>The current Exclusive Fishery Limits extend to 200 miles offshore and cover an area of 132,000 nautical square miles. The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. The number of Patrol Vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and seven. The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.</P>
        <P>Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps. The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft. The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime Search and Rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue region. In accordance with the roles assigned to them by Government in the White Paper on Defence, the Defence Forces are committed to providing support to the civil authorities including in relation to Search and Rescue. In this regard, the Naval Service and Air Corps provide support to the Coast Guard as the need arises and within their available capability.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking rests primarily with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners. However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking. The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities. There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the Permanent Defence Force is fully resourced to meet all its operational requirements.</P>

Ongoing investment in the Defence Forces will ensure that this remains to be the case and will continue to be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The net result is that Defence Forces personnel serving both at home and on overseas missions are equipped with the most modern and effective equipment, including body armour and breathing apparatus. This equipment enables troops to carry out the mission assigned, as well as providing the required protection specific to the mission. In the case of the EU mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, the Defence Forces will deploy a full range of Force Protection assets. This equipment will include Mowag APCs, armoured vehicles, Close Reconnaissance Vehicles and indirect fire capabilities.</P>
        <P>On-going threat assessments are carried out in mission areas and a continuous review process on both personal equipment and force assets is in place to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfil their roles in specific missions.</P>
        <P>Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection. Pre-deployment training is provided to members of the Permanent Defence Force and is updated in the light of any change in the threat assessment.   Prior to deployment on missions, training packages, including realistic Mission Readiness Exercises, are conducted and validated to ensure that units are thoroughly prepared.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There is ongoing monitoring of Defence Forces facilities to ensure they are adequate to meet military requirements. To supplement this my Department is engaged in an on-going capital building programme designed to modernise and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities available to the Defence Forces both Permanent and Reserve. The programme focuses mainly on infrastructural projects comprising the construction of new buildings and the refurbishment of existing buildings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Finner at present, there is a significant project ongoing which involves the upgrading of three Accommodation Billets. This is the second phase of an upgrade programme.  The cost of this phase is approximately &euro;1m.  It is expected that this project will be completed by June 2008.</P>
        <P>Another significant project planned for Finner as part of the Capital Programme is the Construction of a Security and Administration Complex at an estimated cost of  &euro;3.5m.  The new facility will comprise a new Head Quarters for the 28th Infantry Battalion, a Guardroom and an Armory.  It is expected that a competition for the engagement of a design team will be run shortly.  No other significant works are planned for either Finner or Lifford, but some smaller maintenance type works may be undertaken at local level.</P>

        <P>I would also like to refer the Deputy to a service for TDs and Senators concerning the current status of applications, such as the subject of this question, which was introduced in May 2006.  The service was introduced, inter alia, to provide a speedier and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.  This service, which is operated by the Property Registration Authority, is available all year round.</P>
        <P>I can further inform the Deputy that his query has been forwarded to the Property Registration Authority for attention and direct reply via the above mentioned service.</P>

As outlined in the 2008 Annual Policing Plan, it is intended to amalgamate Watercourse and Mallow Road stations. As indicated in my reply, the future of McCurtain Street Garda Station is a matter for consideration by the Garda Authorities and I expect that this will be considered in the context of the amalgamation outlined above and in accordance with the Annual Policing plans. </P>

	<P>The Community-based CCTV Scheme, established in 2005, is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems.  The Scheme offers pre-development (Stage 1) grants of up to &euro;5,000 to enable qualifying applicants to investigate the need for CCTV in their area and to complete a detailed proposal, and development (Stage 2) grants of up to &euro;100,000 from my Department for the establishment of a CCTV scheme.  In addition to this, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs provides successful applicants from RAPID areas with a further grant to a possible maximum of &euro;100,000. Pobal has been engaged to administer the scheme on behalf of the Department.  </P>
        <P>A significant number of schemes were approved for funding last year and Pobal are working with the various groups on their implementation.  When significant progress is made with these schemes, I intend to invite a further round of applications.  While it is not possible to provide a precise date at this stage, I expect that it will be in the second half of the year and it will be open to any group to submit an application for funding at that time.  Further details of the scheme and the relevant documentation are available on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.justice.ie) or on Pobal&rsquo;s website (www.pobal.ie).</P>

Since then, the bikes are <Col N="771"/>in daily use both by members of the Community Policing and regular units.  Their introduction has been very successful and local Garda management report that the Unit provides highly visible and accessible policing in areas such as parks, laneways, footbridges, estates, pedestrianised areas, shopping centres, Luas and Dublin Bus areas.  They provide a fast and reliable mode of transport, especially during peak traffic periods.  The Unit has been very successful in tackling anti-social disorderly behaviour particularly in parks and estates.

        <P>Different arrangements apply depending on the category of person with whom the spouse is seeking reunification. For instance, the spouse of an Irish citizen can expect, providing the marriage is not a marriage of convenience, to gain permission to reside including the right to work.</P>
        <P>If one of the parties is an EU or EEA national, consideration of the case will be in accordance with the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons)(No.2) Regulations (S.I. 656 of 2006), or the European Communities (Aliens) Regulations 1977 (S.I.No.393 of 1977) or the European Communities (Right of Residence for Non-Economically Active Persons) Regulations 1997 (S.I. No. 57 of 1997).</P>
        <P>I understand, however, that the Deputy has a particular case in mind and that the case  may be one based on parentage of an Irish citizen child.   Without seeing the details of the case, however, I cannot comment further on its merits.</P>

        <P>Arrangements for this measure are being put in place at present and when all the necessary resources are in place a communication will issue to all TDs and Senators about the commencement of the e-mail response system.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Skreen Garda Station as <Col N="775"/>at 31 January 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available,  was one. The Sergeant who was allocated to Skreen was recently transferred within the District and that vacancy was advertised and the post is expected to be filled imminently.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account. The next allocation of Probationer Garda&iacute; is due to take place on 13 March next.  In that regard, the needs of Skreen Garda Station will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Additional patrols are provided by uniform personnel from Sligo and Collooney station parties, supplemented by the District Detective Unit and the Divisional Traffic Corps personnel.</P>

	<P>Property management agents provide property-related services under contract for property management companies. Because they provide property services, such agents will, together with auctioneers and estate agents, be covered by the licensing system to be operated by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  The Property Services Regulatory Authority Bill, under which the new Authority will be formally established, is currently being drafted and I intend to publish it as soon as possible this year.</P>
        <P>As regards property management companies, the position is that the Law Reform Commission published a Consultation Paper on Multi-Unit Developments in December 2006.  It identified a broad range of regulatory and other issues arising in relation to such developments, including problems arising from the manner in which company law currently applies to property management companies.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission has indicated that it will publish, as soon as possible, its Report on Multi-Unit Developments which, following an extensive consultation process, will contain reform proposals concerning the regulation and governance of property management companies.  The Government has already directed that early action be taken by the relevant Departments to address the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations; the types of action will, of course, be dependent on the form that the recommendations take.</P>
        <P>A high-level interdepartmental committee, under the chairmanship of my Department, comprising representatives of relevant Departments and Offices has been established to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive response to the problems arising in relation to multi-unit developments.  A key task of this committee will be to identify the legislative and administrative actions to be taken in response to the Commission&rsquo;s reform recommendations and to determine a timescale for their implementation.  Following publication of the Commission&rsquo;s Report, this committee will report to a Cabinet Committee whose membership will include the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Attorney General.</P>

	<P>Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994, a person may seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.  A public information leaflet outlining the legal options available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available from my Department and is also on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.environ.ie.</P>
        <P>Noise nuisance and other problems caused by local authority tenants are also covered under legislation.  The tenancy agreement, which is the legal basis of the relationship between the local authority and its tenants, will generally contain provisions in relation to the type of behaviour that is, or is not, acceptable.  The local authority is empowered, under Section 62 of the Housing Act 1966, to initiate proceedings to secure an eviction where a tenant has breached the conditions of the tenancy agreement.</P>
        <P>In the case of noise nuisance being caused by individuals in private rented accommodation, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 contains a provision for third parties who are adversely affected by a failure on the part of a landlord to enforce tenant obligations to refer a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) in accordance with the procedures in the Act.</P>

This facilitates regular consultation in relation to issues involving designated land and the interface between nature conservation and the agri-environment.</P><Col N="781"/>
        <P>In addition, as regards briefing of farmers affected by destocking and overwintering measures which are necessary on the 12 Bens, once the measures concerned have been determined by both Departments, each affected farmer will be individually notified and invited to attend local clinics where their individual concerns can be discussed.  This is likely to take place in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>Ireland ratified the World Heritage Convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage in 1991.  Nominations to the World Heritage List are considered only if a nominated property has been included on the State Party&rsquo;s tentative list i.e. an inventory of those cultural and natural heritage properties considered to be of outstanding and unique value.  There are eight sites on the current tentative list, including Cashel, which can be considered for nomination.  Two sites from this list have been successfully inscribed on the World Heritage List namely Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne, in 1993, and Skellig Michael, in 1996.  </P>
        <P>The World Heritage Committee, the main body with responsibility for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention, has developed guidance for the inscription of properties on the World Heritage List, as set out in Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention on UNESCO&rsquo;s website.  The application process typically involves the preparation of a detailed Management Plan, appropriate planning controls / restrictions in the vicinity of the site, extensive stakeholder consultation, a conservation plan and an expert comparative analysis setting out the Outstanding Universal Value of the site.</P>
        <P>The World Heritage Committee recommends that tentative lists be reviewed every ten years.  In view of this it is my intention to review the existing tentative list this year. The preparation of applications for the remaining sites on the current list, including Cashel, and for any new additions to the list, will be considered in the context of that review.</P>

	<P>I received the correspondence referred to in the question and a reply issued from my office to the correspondent on 18 February 2008. The reply set out the position in regard to wastewater treatment systems under the national Building Regulations. </P>
        <P>I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 312 and 314 on 6 February, 2008.</P>
        <P>Part H of the Building Regulations (Drainage and Waste Water Disposal) sets out the requirements for the treatment of effluent from wastewater systems. The relevant Technical Guidance Document H (TGD-H) provides guidance on how to comply with the requirements of Part H and calls up, inter alia, Irish Standard Recommendation SR:6 of 1991 &mdash; Recommendations for Domestic Effluent Treatment and Disposal from a Single Dwelling House, issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).</P>
        <P>TGD-H also acknowledges that wastewater treatment systems other than septic tanks may be used. Such systems are accepted as satisfactory provided it can be shown that they are fit <Col N="782"/>for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are used. Part D of the Building Regulations (Materials and Workmanship) specifies alternative ways of proving compliance, including compliance with appropriate product standards or being subject to certification by an appropriate national certification body.</P>
        <P>The Irish Agr&eacute;ment Board (IAB) is the national and European recognised body for certifying new building products or systems for which national standards do not exist. The IAB is an independent body which operates under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>A new European Standard (EN 12566-3) for small wastewater treatments plants has been introduced and is now in the transitional phase of implementation. The need for new systems to comply with this standard has been brought to the attention of Local Authorities by Departmental Circular Letters BC16/2006 and BC 2/2008, dated 8 November 2006 and 28 January 2008 respectively.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently finalising a revised edition of their Manual on Wastewater Treatment Systems serving Single Houses, in consultation with all interested parties. It is understood that the EPA Manual will refer to relevant European Standards and that the NSAI propose to withdraw SR6: 1991, in favour of the proposed new edition of the EPA Manual, when available.  My Department plans to amend TGD-H to call up the EPA Manual and to consider any related issues at that time.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The functions of local authorities under the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 (&ldquo;the Nitrates Regulations&rdquo;) are clearly prescribed in the Regulations and include matters such as the monitoring of water quality, inspection of farm holdings, consultation and co-ordination with other public authorities, powers to specify variations on the size of protection zones around drinking water abstraction points and related matters. The terms and requirements of the Regulations were notified to local authorities by my Department in circular letters issued to the authorities and in briefing sessions held for local authority staff. </P>
        <P>Article 29(6) of the Regulations provides that the EPA may make recommendations and give directions to a local authority in relation to the monitoring and inspections to be carried out and other measures to be taken by the authority for the purposes of the Regulations. This provision is in keeping with the general powers of the EPA under the Environmental Protection <Col N="784"/>Agency Acts to exercise supervision in relation to the performance by local authorities of their environmental protection functions. I understand that the EPA is preparing guidelines for issue to local authorities on implementation of the Regulations and other environmental legislation.</P>
        <P>In addition to the enforcement activities of local authorities, implementation of the Nitrates Regulations is supported by farm inspections carried out by staff of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the context of the operation of the Single Farm Payment Scheme and cross-compliance requirements.</P>
        <P>I am currently reviewing the overall employment position in the local government sector, having regard to the need to deliver front line services (including environmental inspections and enforcement functions), and achieve value for money within the parameters of Government policy on public service employment generally.  As part of this review, my Department is consulting the Department of Finance in relation to the current ceiling on local authority staff numbers, including impacts in relation to increased EU requirements and other obligations on the local government sector.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 690 and 691 together.</P>
        <P>Proposals for water and sewerage schemes in both Cashel and Carrick on Suir were included in the list of schemes submitted by South Tipperary County Council in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to all local authorities in 2006 to undertake assessments of needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of these assessments.  The assessments were taken into account in the preparation of my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007 &mdash; 2009 which was published in September 2007 and is available in the Oireachtas Library.  Given the level of competing demands for the available funding and the priorities adopted by the elected members of South Tipperary County Council, it was not possible to include these schemes in the current Programme.</P>

	<P>The Greener Homes Scheme provides assistance to homeowners who intend to purchase a new renewable energy heating system for either new or existing homes. The scheme is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and aims to increase the use of renewable energy and sustainable energy technologies in Irish homes.</P>
        <P>Renewable energy heating systems are new technologies which, while proven and highly utilised overseas, are now gaining popularity in Ireland.  The Irish Government, through SEI, wishes to encourage people to green their homes by contributing to the initial investment cost of installing a renewable energy heating system. The government believes that this will help ensure a faster uptake of renewable heating systems which will underpin the development of a long term market, while enabling homeowners to play their part in reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
        <P>The grants are provided to householders who invest in renewable energy based heating systems under the following categories:Solar heating &mdash; for space heating and/or hot waterHeat pump &mdash; horizontal collector, vertical collector, well water or air source Wood Chip or Pellet stoves &mdash; with or without integral boilerWood Chip or Pellet boilers</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 702 to 704, inclusive together. </P>
        <P>The House of Tomorrow programme opened in 2001 and by time of closure had committed grants to housing developments comprising around 6,000 units.  The programme closed for applications in June, arising from a Government commitment to revise Part L of the Building Regulations to require energy and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> performance levels in new homes similar to those which had been demonstrated through the House of Tomorrow programme as being achievable, or a strengthening by some 40% relative to the current regulations.  In the period from 19th February 2007 to the ultimate closure of the programme at the end of June 2007, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) committed grants of &euro;4.8 million to projects under the House of Tomorrow programme.</P>
        <P>Under the programme, approximately 6,000 housing units have been approved for funding support, of which over 3,000 units have been completed to date and less than 2,000 units are in normal occupancy of more than one year.  In the nature of building demonstration projects of this kind, verification of energy performance in practice typically requires a minimum established pattern of one year&rsquo;s normal occupancy.  SEI is currently commissioning an extensive performance evaluation of such established units supported under the House of Tomorrow programme, comprising assessment of the objective energy, CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> and cost saving impacts, together with an assessment of the experiences and attitudes of affected parties including occupants, builders, service providers, architects, estate agents and local authorities in relation to <Col N="790"/>representative samples of these homes.  The results of this work are unlikely to be available before the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>However, early indications from a number of the more advanced developments under the programme are that user experiences in relation to comfort levels and running costs are most encouraging.</P>

	<P>The public receives a wide variety of mail from a number of sources, much of which can be regarded as unsolicited mail, including unaddressed mail material, which may be delivered by An Post or other operators.  An Post is statutorily obliged, under Section 12 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, to satisfy all reasonable demands for postal services throughout the State.</P>
        <P>Measures are already in place to manage the impact of direct mailing.  Under Section 2(7) of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, individuals have the right to request that they be removed from any direct mailing lists used by businesses.  Householders also have the option of limiting the amount of unsolicited mail they receive by completing a Mailing Preference Service form requesting that their names be removed from mailing lists controlled by members of the Irish Direct Marketing Association.  Individuals may contact the Irish Direct Marketing Association directly or, alternatively, can complete a form available from post offices.  This form goes directly to the Irish Direct Marketing Association and applies to addressed mail sent by their members.</P>
        <P>I have no intention at this time to introduce additional measures in respect of direct mailing.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 708 and 756 together.  </P>
        <P>The Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) programme establishes a stable investment environment for new renewable energy projects across a variety of renewable energy technologies which might not otherwise secure the necessary investment.  The different prices in REFIT, by category, for biomass, biomass AD/CHP, small-hydropower, landfill-gas, wave/ocean, large-wind, small-wind and offshore-wind reflect the different investment costs in each category.  The provision of a higher price in any category is indicative of the higher costs in that category to ensure the completion of projects.  However, these tariffs are not indicative of any preference for one category over another.</P>
        <P>Requests for connections to the electricity network, in the case of both onshore and offshore wind powered projects, are a matter for ESB Networks or EirGrid.  Any dispute about the terms or conditions of any response to a request for a connection is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation.  I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
        <P>The  tariffs published  in the terms and conditions of the REFIT support programme for onshore wind-powered projects is &euro;57 megawatt-hour for large scale wind powered projects and &euro;59 megawatt-hour for small scale wind powered projects.  In accordance with the published REFIT terms and conditions these tariffs have increased in line with the change in the consumer price index in 2006 with effect from 1st January 2007 and again in line with the change in the consumer price index in 2007 with effect from 1st January 2008.</P>

In accordance with the published REFIT terms and conditions these tariffs have increased in line with the change in the consumer price index (CPI) in 2006 with effect from 1.1.2007 and in line with the change in the CPI in 2007 with effect from 1.1.2008.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 710 and 712 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</P>
        <P>There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is underway.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved, including any unserved areas in Co. Donegal, and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ))   is now complete, and four candidates pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process. The four candidates were, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, Eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.</P>
        <P>Following the withdrawal of the IFA/Motorola Consortium as a candidate the remaining three candidates have now commenced &ldquo;Competitive Dialogue&rdquo; with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department&rsquo;s requirements for the delivery of broadband to the unserved areas of the country.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008, with rollout to commence as soon as possible thereafter, subject to agreement with the chosen candidate.</P>

This was because there were monies recouped in 2007 by the BCI from the Broadcasting Funding Scheme in respect of the cost of administration and expenses of the Scheme.  From 2004 to 2006, the BCI had paid these from its own resources rather than from the Broadcasting Fund itself.  The scheme provides funding to support grants for new television and radio programmes on Irish culture and heritage, it is administered by the BCI, and funded from 5% of net television licence fee receipts.</P>
