	<P>It is proposed to take No. 8<i>a</i>, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 (Section 5) (Specified Period) Order 2008; and No. 1, Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage (resumed).  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 8<i>a </i>shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after two hours, and that the following arrangements shall apply &mdash; the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the statements of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed five minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 8<i>a</i>, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 (Section 5) (Specified Period) Order 2008 agreed to?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two matters I would like to raise with the T&aacute;naiste today.  The first matter, Sir, arises out of the legislative proposal to provide for a judicial council, which has been around for some time.  There were proceedings yesterday in the courts in which a rape conviction was sustained and a sentence imposed of five years, suspended for three, which will result in the offender having to serve two years in jail.  He was described by the judge in the course of sentencing as being a person of good character.  The leniency of the sentencing has given rise to substantial public concern.  I am aware that is not a matter for this House.  The Director of Public Prosecutions can appeal against leniency to the court of appeal, and I believe in this case it is appropriate that he does so.  However, there are two issues that are matters for this House.  There is no mechanism at present in so far as any individual member of the public may wish to complain about comments made by members of the Judiciary.  The judicial council would provide that.  What is the position with regard to bringing forward that legislation?</P>
        <P>Second, in regard to this case, an offer of compensation was made by the convicted rapist to the victim.  The victim indicated to the court that she would be willing to accept compensation if ordered by the court but not on the voluntary offer of the convicted offender.  There is no legislation at present that allows the courts to require a convicted person to pay compensation <Col N="240"/>to a victim in cases where there are convictions for rape or other sexual offences, or where there are convictions for simple assault.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but is legislation promised on it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I am coming to.  I believe there is a need for such legislation.  In the light of what occurred yesterday, will the Government give any consideration to the enactment of such legislation?  At present, victims can only get compensation if they bring separate court proceedings.</P>
        <P>I will be briefer on the second matter, which is also a matter of legislation.  Following the publication of the Ferns Report, the Minister of State with responsibility for children announced that consideration would be given to the manner in which the Children First guidelines were being implemented, and to the possibility of them being given statutory force.  It is appropriate that we raise this today because we will deal later with the commission of inquiry into abuse in residential institutions.  Prior to the reshuffle, the then Minister of State with responsibility for children indicated to the House that the report should be completed by the end of December.  I have information available to me that indicates the Children First guidelines are not being implemented, and that if one is a child abuser in the southern part of the country one is less likely to be detected than if one is in what is described in Health Service Executive parlance as the Dublin-mid-Leinster area.  In the context of those areas, for example, in 2006 out of the totality of child abuse allegations made, 29% in Dublin-mid-Leinster area were found to be correct&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shatter cannot go into that now, he must ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as compared to only 7% in the southern area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We must move on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Child abusers in the southern part of this State are scot free and have practically open season to abuse children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shatter must confine himself to the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the report be published on the review of the applications of the Children First guidelines?  Does the Government intend to make the guidelines statutory and can the T&aacute;naiste provide assurance to people outside this House to guarantee the safety of children who are at risk of abuse in circumstances where we currently have hundreds of cases that are not being allocated to social workers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We must confine ourselves to the legislation, Deputy Shatter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Can this House guarantee that no child will die or suffer serious injury as a consequence of the failure of the HSE to apply the Children First guidelines?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste to reply on the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The judicial council will be introduced later this year.  As Deputy Shatter is aware, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was awaiting the views of the Chief Justice and he has nominated someone to liaise in those discussions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding sentencing, being an eminent lawyer Deputy Shatter will appreciate that we cannot make public comment on the matter, given the independence of the Judiciary.  It would <Col N="241"/>be inappropriate for me to comment on any particular case.  On a general point, as we all know, the DPP has powers to allow an appeal if it is considered that an unduly lenient sentence has been imposed.  It is our intention within the overall programme for Government to strengthen victims&rsquo; rights and due consideration and regard can be taken of the other point regarding compensation.  I will liaise with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and advise him of Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s comments.</P>
        <P>On the Ferns Report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>He has not been seen since he was appointed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please, Deputy Flanagan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The man was here yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy Johnny Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>You were not here for the past five years either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is anticipated that the Ferns Report will be brought to finality.  As the Deputy will know, the Children First guidelines are being extensively reviewed.  There has been discussion with the stakeholders.  We have always evolved these issues in the context of new outcomes and considerations.  If those are available in the Ferns Report, I am sure they will be involved and reflected on as we have done in my 21 years as a Member of this House.  I remember one of my first occasions in this House was the debate on important legislation, the Children Act, which took almost 80 years to bring to fruition.  We have seen an evolving child protection facility and advanced services being provided.  The Minister of State will extensively review the Children First guidelines in the context of any outcomes that arise from a public perspective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore has been called.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise three matters.  The first is an issue that I raised yesterday during Leaders Questions, which relates to prices and the extent to which consumers are being ripped off.  I understand that following my raising the matter with the Taoiseach yesterday he asked the T&aacute;naiste to get a handle on the problem.  I was a little surprised that after 11 years in Government neither the T&aacute;naiste nor the Taoiseach appears to have a handle on the prices problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can Deputy Gilmore translate the handle into legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to it.  The translation facilities were a little inadequate yesterday.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have a handle on it yet?  When can we expect her to make a statement to the House on the prices issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, making a statement in the House is in order and I am asking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the issue of prices on the Order of Business?  It is not in order.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="242"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;whether the T&aacute;naiste will make a statement to the House on the prices issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Government yesterday decided to decline the request from Waterford Wedgwood to underwrite a loan for that company.  Particularly as the T&aacute;naiste is the line Minister, can I ask her if the Government is really going to let Waterford Wedgwood go to the wall?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">May I ask about the electoral Bill?  Is that in order, a Cheann Comhairle?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Third time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Next week, we are scheduled to have statements on the report of the Constituency Commission.  Does the taking of those statements next week have any implications for the promised electoral Bill to implement the report of the Constituency Commission and when will that Bill be introduced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The electoral Bill will be before the House this session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the debate for?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the other issues&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The others are not in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I met the National Consumer Agency, which was a <i>pro forma</i> meeting to brief the Minister on these issues.  I will be issuing a statement arising from that discussion.  The issue of Waterford Wedgwood was raised in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We are firmly of the view that there will continue to be a solid future for a restructured Waterford Wedgwood.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach suggested that the Opposition would be invited to discuss management companies with the three or four Ministers involved.  Will that be collectively?  The National Consumer Agency, which we discussed yesterday, seems to have a remit in this matter also.  As with prices in the shops, it seems powerless to do anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it on legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to restrain management company owners, usually the developers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>About what legislation is the Deputy speaking?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;ripping off young couples who have just bought an apartment.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="243"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>About what legislation is the Deputy speaking?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>They are charging them &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000 a year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>What legislation is it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste to clarify the arrangements regarding the three or four pieces of legislation and the consultation arrangements with the Opposition that the Taoiseach has mentioned twice.  The T&aacute;naiste is the lead Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we have legislation on management companies and what are the arrangements?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation is promised.  A meeting of the relevant Ministers will take place next week.  There are two aspects of it under my Department.  One, in the overall context, is the legal preparation for the Bill.  The other regarding the National Consumer Agency is outside the legal remit and is a matter of protocol between the industry and the criteria set down for management.  There is a commitment to provide legislation and we hope to arrange a <i>pro forma</i> meeting among everyone for Wednesday or Thursday next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for clarification on that matter.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about the industry.  Does this relate to the construction industry, the people who run management companies, usually developers who appoint their brother or the foreman to be the management company, or the agencies?  A consolidated companies Bill is also promised.  Originally the T&aacute;naiste indicated the management companies would be dealt with through that legislation.  However, that is an onerous and large Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have that now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is she saying that her Department will expedite legislation to deal with the management company issue separately, given its urgency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We are speaking about two issues.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the lead Department on one.  This will be the new legislation to be introduced and the Law Reform Commission will make its views available to the Government.  A Cabinet sub-committee is meeting next week and discussions will take place with the Opposition.  That is under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>There is a different scenario regarding the companies consolidation Bill on which I spoke to the Deputy&rsquo;s party spokesperson.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, and I will work through that.  Given that it is an extensive Bill, <i>pro forma</i> we should go through the discussions on that in a different way.  Separate from all that and feeding into the companies legislation, work is being carried out by the National Consumer Agency on my behalf specifically regarding issues outside the legal remit which will be introduced to the House under separate legislation under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does it have a remit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must go on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to restrain price increases and rip-off prices for young people who bought homes in developments with management companies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot go into those details now.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="244"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The key issue is that people are being ripped off by management companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot go into that now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, the Government published the report of the National Commission on Restorative Justice.  In complimenting Judge Mary Martin on a very useful contribution to the criminal justice system, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to ensure time is made available at the earliest opportunity to discuss this report in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe it is an interim report.  However, I am sure we can facilitate discussions in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked for a debate on the exclusion of Irish cytology laboratories from the screening programme for cervical cancer.  I understand the matter has been discussed by the Whips.  Have arrangements been made to hold that debate before the decision is<?oasys _jy ?>made?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no proposal for that matter to be debated.  However, I am sure it could be raised on the Adjournment or in other ways.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand it has been raised at the Whips&rsquo; meeting.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="245"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I have before me the statement issued by the Minister of State with responsibility for children following the publication of the Ferns Report.  He said the review of the guidelines would be complete by December 2007.  Has that review been completed yet?  Will it be published?  When will it be put in the Oireachtas Library and be available for a debate in this House?  Does the Government intend to give statutory force to the guidelines to ensure that what is happening today does not continue to happen because the debate we will have in this House today, looking back at what happened in residential institutions in the past&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>An extensive review of the workings of the Children First guidelines has taken place.  There has been consultation with all the stakeholders and, in view of the McElwee report, further consideration is being given to a review.  As to whether those guidelines will be mandatory, no firm decision has been made yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste already raised it and I am seeking clarity on what she said on the issue.  The Minister said she sees a sound future for a restructured Waterford Crystal, but how can she reconcile that with the fact that the company needs loans of &euro;39 million to effect the restructuring package and that it has no capacity to borrow?  That does not add up.  As my party leader said, will 550 jobs be allowed to go down the tubes?</P>

We were not in a position to do that.  As I said, however, it is our hope and aspiration that through the restructuring the Waterford Group will find itself in a position where it can deal with the issues appertaining to Waterford and the group in its entirety.  I gave an undertaking that in the event of further investment, all the agencies I represent will do all they can to support the company.

It would be most useful if the Opposition spokes<Col N="247"/>persons, at least, although many Members will have an interest in this, could have supplied to them the heads of the Bills as approved by Government.

There are two substantial items of legislation before her and is she in a position, having only recently taken up the post, to comment on their progress?  The first is the consolidated companies Bill, with 1,300 sections, which is an unprecedentedly large Bill.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessor if extra resources were being provided to expedite the production of that Bill, which is key to our commercial success and modernisation.</P>
        <P>The second item is the rationalisation, consolidation and reform of our industrial relations legislation.  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate the position regarding those Bills?  They are not the normal run of the mill types of legislation.  Is it the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s intention to seek outside resources or assistance to draft them?</P>

Is that the case and when are we likely to see that legislation?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not have a date.  There will be a differential between foreshore responsibilities; some of which will remain within the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, including the issues of piers and harbours, ports and fishery harbours, while the other aspects will be transferred to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Given that there have been changes in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, transfers of functions will have to be put before the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the draft Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 (Section 5) (Specified Period) Order 2008, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 21 May 2008.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The extension is required to allow the commission to fulfil its statutory mandate to publish its report during the specified period.  The current period expires at midnight tonight, 22 May 2008.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">As obliged under the Act, the Department consulted the commission on the timeframe for the extension of the current specified period.  The commission, which is independent of the Department in its functions, has requested an extension by eight months to the end of January 2009 to allow for completion of the report and to make the necessary preparations for its publication.  Under the terms of section 5(5) of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, an order to extend the term of the commission must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Since the Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology of 11 May 1999 to the victims of abuse in childhood a series of Government measures have been introduced for the redress of abuse.  These measures include the establishment of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the setting up of a financial redress scheme for victims of abuse and the establishment of a statutory redress board to administer such a scheme, the provision of counselling and the education finance board.</P>
        <P>The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was formally established in May 2000. The broad terms of reference are to afford victims of abuse in childhood an opportunity to tell of the abuse they suffered to a sympathetic and experienced forum; to establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of the physical and sexual abuse of children <Col N="249"/>in institutions and in other places during the period from 1940 to the present; and to compile a report and publish it to the public on the activities and the findings of the commission, containing recommendations on actions to address the continuing effects of the abuse and actions to be taken to safeguard children from abuse in the future.</P>
        <P>As one of its core functions, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse provides those who were previously silenced with an opportunity to relate their accounts of childhood abuse to an experienced and sympathetic forum.  For some people this therapeutic role is all that they require of the commission, while for others their wish is that their allegations are inquired into.  To ensure that the two strands can be accommodated, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 provides for two committees, the confidential committee and the investigation committee.  This has ensured, on the one hand, the right to confidentiality of those who want only to access the therapeutic role of the commission and, on the other hand, rights to natural justice of persons accused of abuse.</P>
        <P>The confidential committee has provided a forum for 1,090 victims of abuse to recount their experience on an entirely confidential basis.  The purpose of this committee is to meet the needs of those victims who want to speak of their experiences but who do not wish to become involved in an investigative procedure.  The confidential committee is in the process of completing the final draft of the committee&rsquo;s report and the report and its conclusions will be presented to the board of the commission.</P>
        <P>The investigation committee has been investigating complaints and allegations made to it.  It has the power to compel persons accused to attend before it and to produce any documents it requires.  Therefore, the investigation committee is facilitating victims who wish to recount their experiences and to have allegations of abuse fully inquired into.  To date, part of the investigation committee&rsquo;s activities have included: full hearings for 252 people &mdash; 545 people were interviewed by documentary junior counsel and 41 had both an interview and a full hearing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The investigation committee has also held public hearings into a number of specific institutions.  Evidence has been submitted to the investigation committee at public hearings in relation to the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Irish Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Children.  Currently most of the hearings and interviews have been completed but the investigation committee may hold further hearings if it deems it necessary to complete its work.  This committee is in the process of writing its report.  While no further hearings are planned, the commissioners are working hard to review a very large body of oral and documentary evidence which will form the basis for the report.  On completion, the commission will publish its report directly to the public.  This is an important feature of the independence of the commission.  The report of the commission will be based on the reports of its committees.</P>
        <P>The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act provides that in its report the commission may identify institutions in which abuse occurred and the people responsible and make findings in regard to the role and responsibility of management and regulatory authorities.  The report, however, following the recommendation of the commission, will not make findings on any individual case.  The commission in its report may also make recommendations relating to measures to alleviate the effects of abuse on victims.  The publication of the report will not represent the end of the commission&rsquo;s operations.  There are other functions to be performed, which statutorily can continue after the specified period has lapsed.  These include settlement of all third party legal representation costs, management of discovery documentation held by the commission, the carrying out of any work related to post-publication of reports and management of the commission&rsquo;s general shut-down.</P><Col N="250"/>
        <P>The commission, during the period of its existence, has been the recipient of a voluminous body of extremely confidential and sensitive material.  Consequently and in accordance with section 6 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse 2000, it will have to make such arrangements as it considers appropriate for the making of as complete a record as is practicable of the proceedings of the commission and the committees.  It will also be charged with making arrangements for the custody or disposal of the documents provided for the commission.  This in itself will not be an easy task.</P>
        <P>Expenditure for the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse from inception to the end of 2007 was &euro;43.7 million.  At this point, it is estimated that an additional provision in the region of &euro;45 million to &euro;55 million may be required to meet remaining overall costs of the commission to the end of 2009.  The 2008 allocation of &euro;18.1 million will meet part of this liability.  This is a tentative provision, given that the commission has yet to receive and assess a large volume of third party legal costs.</P>
        <P>I request Deputies to approve this resolution by supporting the motion.  By doing so, Deputies are enabling the commission to finalise its statutory mandate.  By supporting the motion, Deputies will provide the legal basis through which the Government and this House have previously decided that the commission would report and will provide the opportunity for a regrettable episode in Irish history to be recorded fully, accurately and fairly.  By supporting this motion, Deputies will allow for the commission inquiry to be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
        <P>The publication of the report, containing the findings and recommendations of the commission, is an essential part of the service which the Government can render to our society.  However, while Irish society as a whole can benefit from its work, let us not forget that this is primarily a commission for the victims of abuse.  The work of the commission and its public report is an opportunity for it to receive the type of respectful and sympathetic hearing to which it is entitled.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Fine Gael spokesman on education, I welcome the briefing I have been given by officials at the Department of Education and Science when this matter was first brought to my attention on Friday last.  Clearly, there was a view within our party that we would support the motion as a means of bringing to an end the work of the commission and ensuring that it could complete its report, put it into the public domain as soon as possible and bring to an end this sorry saga which started when the Taoiseach first apologised on behalf of the country in 1999.  Any contribution we make in this debate will be marshalled towards ensuring the full publication of the report as soon as possible.  I wish the commission well in this regard.</P>
        <P>When the motion is passed, as I assume it will, and when the eight-month period is established, it will be important to send a very strong message from this House to the effect that the report should be published once completed.  The period covered in the investigation dates from 1921 to 1980 and, therefore, many of those who made a complaint could be dead.  It is crucial, therefore, that the report be published immediately when the commission completes its work.  This would offer some comfort to those who made very serious complaints to the commission over the past eight years or so.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has already given us information on the dual work of the commission, which involves the confidential committee and the investigative committee.  Over 1,090 people have made direct complaints to the confidential committee and 252 have made complaints to the investigative committee, part of the work of which is in public session.</P><Col N="251"/>
        <P>It is crucial to the integrity of the commission and the investigative process that the commission&rsquo;s recommendations be circulated in the public domain as soon as possible given the age of those who had to make complaints over the past seven or eight years.  While the investigation is judicial, most of the commission&rsquo;s work has been in private.  This model of investigation is very useful in dealing with such sensitive issues to the satisfaction of the victims who were abused over a long period.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say that the response to this issue since 2002 by the previous Government was found wanting.  I refer specifically to the decision taken by Ms Justice Laffoy in 2003 to resign from the commission because of the failure on the part of the Department of Education and Science to co-operate with the commission she was chairing at the time.  She put on the public record very serious deficiencies on the part of the Department at the initial stage of the commission&rsquo;s work and referred to its co-operation, or lack thereof.  Ms Justice Laffoy was hampered in her work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fundamental flaw was that the commission was under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science when it should not have been, given that the Department had a contractual relationship with the 18 institutions and religious orders for the placement of children over the period under investigation.  Considerable mistakes were made in 2002 and 2003 and I am glad that we have been able to make progress since the appointment of Mr. Justice Ryan and the amendment of the standing orders of the commission in 2003.</P>
        <P>Very severe mistakes were made by the Government in 2002 and this holds true even if one ignores the indemnity agreement.  This agreement, given its content and the sum of money provided, was possibly the worst the State has ever negotiated between it and the 18 religious congregations.  Over the course of the next few years, we will look back on this period in our history with much shame and regret.</P>
        <P>Regardless of what we do about the past, it is crucial that the State updates the law on child protection and that the D&aacute;il ensures the Government is held to account regarding the prosecution and resourcing of child protection policy.  Considerable mistakes were made in the past and terrible injustices were suffered over many years.  It is crucial that we have in place, and have confidence in, a system of child protection that ensures neglect and abuse, where they occur, are highlighted immediately and appropriate action is taken.</P>
        <P>Given the comments of Deputy Shatter on the Order of Business today, the comments of many individuals and the work of &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; over the past two weeks, it is evident that there is insufficient confidence in the existing regime of child care protection in the State.</P>
        <P>During Question Time with the Minister for Education and Science yesterday, I raised the issue of the vetting of teachers who work with children in the education system.  The Minister confirmed that in excess of 1,000 untrained substitute teachers are working in the system daily, yet there is no means whatsoever by which to vet them and assess their standing in terms of child protection.  There is a fundamental legal loophole over which the Department has presided.  There are no vetting arrangements whatsoever for untrained substitute teachers, yet we talk about the extraordinarily scandalous abuses of the past.  This is unacceptable.  The Department has known about this problem for many years.  Of the 55,000 teachers currently working in the system, how many have been vetted by way of the procedure over which the Minister of State and the Department allegedly stand and support?</P>
        <P>I am aware that the vetting procedures are working well in respect of new recruits to the teaching profession.  Once a teacher is trained in college, he or she is subject to a vetting procedure.  However, what about the teachers who may have been out of the country for a long period and who return to this jurisdiction to teach in our schools?  Are there guarantees that there are no difficulties with this cohort?  The vetting procedures over which the Department <Col N="252"/>allegedly stands are not working and are utterly deficient in offering assurances and guarantees in respect of child protection.</P>
        <P>I am glad I have the opportunity to refer to a conference organised last weekend by the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  It addressed the question of how a teacher, principal or board of management should report alleged abuse and deal with the issue when it arises in the school setting.  Let me put on record some of the findings of the survey commissioned recently by the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  One in four teachers in primary schools has referred an allegation or made a disclosure of child abuse to the Health Service Executive.  This is an extraordinary statistic.  Nearly 25% of teachers have made that complaint.  However, fewer than half of the primary teachers charged with reporting allegations of child abuse to the HSE have had any training and of those, 70% indicated it was inadequate.  Designated officers, the vast majority of whom are school principals, are being asked to take responsibility in a school setting for both reporting allegations or potential problems of child abuse and taking responsibility for the establishment of such regimes within schools.  However, such officers have not been given adequate training and support from the HSE or the Department of Education and Science.  It is unforgivable that such a situation should obtain within Irish schools.  Great responsibility has been given in legislation to the designated officers, the vast majority of whom are principals, but they are being asked to do a job for which they have not been properly trained.  I await with interest the Minister of State&rsquo;s response at the conclusion of this debate.  The Department of Education and Science has a specific responsibility to co-ordinate the activities of the HSE in the country&rsquo;s 4,500 schools to ensure those designated officers are given the requisite support, hands-on help and proper training for those designated officers.</P>
        <P>Reference was made in the course of the aforementioned conference last weekend to difficulties that are arising in respect of the issue of child protection with some newcomer children.  I refer in particular to cultural differences and what the parents of such children consider to be acceptable levels of punishment and discipline.  Given the new multiethnic school system that we have and the extraordinary opportunities for this country that come with it, arising from teachers&rsquo; observations I suggest there is an issue regarding the appropriateness of discipline and action taken by some newcomer parents to this country.  There is an absolute responsibility at school level to ensure parents who come from different cultures to live in Ireland must become aware of what is and is not acceptable in respect of punishment of their children or the standards applied in Ireland.  This only can be done through information, inclusion and by the Department taking responsibility through the school system to ensure the inculcation in all children and parents of what we consider to be acceptable standards of behaviour by parents towards their children, thus ensuring that such standards will apply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I noted at the outset, Fine Gael supports the motion and wishes the commission well.  Crucially, however, the victims of this extraordinary scandal of child abuse are people who now are in their 60s, 70s and possibly 80s.  From their perspective, this issue must be brought to a conclusion and the report must be published.  Most importantly, recommendations for the future must be learned as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I do not propose to take up the 15 minutes allotted to me.  This is a net point in respect of providing the necessary statutory time to enable the commission to complete its report.  I endorse the comments made by my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes.  While I do not propose to repeat them, anyone who reads the Official Report should note that I endorsed fully his remarks.</P>
        <P>As recently as two days ago, I received an e-mail from a principal of a primary school in the inner city area of my constituency.  She had been informed by a suicidal parent that the parent <Col N="253"/>was of a mind to kill both herself and her three children.  The principal had reported this to the relevant section of the HSE, which is akin to throwing a ball into a haystack.  Effectively, this bewildered principal, who has 25 years&rsquo; experience, who I know personally and who I regard as a professional in every respect, had sent out a cry for help on the basis that she did not receive the required response.  If the Minister of State wishes, I can provide him with the details.  While this obviously constitutes sensitive information, I wish to bring this matter to his attention formally because I have formed the impression that the Department of Education and Science and the HSE do not even know their respective locations.  I have formed the impression that the Department of Education and Science has no proper connection with what used to be the health boards and what is now the impenetrable HSE, the operation of which makes the KGB look like a transparent organisation.</P>
        <P>Although the motion under discussion is concerned with the past, one must have regard for what is taking place at present.  I refer in particular to those issues to which Deputy Hayes referred in respect of newcomers and different standards.  I no longer support the view of multiculturalism which I did in what may have been more benevolent or tolerant ways.  People who come to live in our society must live by our mores with all the diversity that allows.  However, I do not find acceptable the abuse of women and children as being part of the culture of those who have come from another part of the world and who have chosen to settle in our society.  Such abuse, masked as some sort of cultural mores within a sub-group is not acceptable, regardless of whether it occurs in traveller communities indigenous to this society or among people who come from outside this society.  Children are highly vulnerable in this regard.</P>
        <P>While supporting the motion and expressing the hope the report will be published as quickly as possible, I wish to notify the Minister of State that while this motion pertains to looking into the past in respect of historic abuse, the present also must be examined.  I will be happy to make the information to which I referred earlier available to the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the previous speaker, I do not intend to use all my allotted time.  I fully support the request from the Minister of State for an extension of time.  This already has taken place on previous occasions.  The work being carried by the commission&rsquo;s two committees is extremely important and adequate time must be granted to allow it to carry out its remit.  Those who simply come to talk in a therapeutic sense and those who come to go further with their cases must be allocated the fullest time to be listened to in the confidential committee and the investigation committee.  Those who wish to go further must be given time so a full investigation by the committee and its members into what has happened to them can be engaged in.</P>
        <P>As I heard the Minister of State speak this morning, I thought of how short the timespan is for people.  One looks back to 1999 and recalls the then Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology and the great uproar the matter correctly occasioned in people&rsquo;s minds, in newspapers and in public opinion.  I know of people who, when the stories of those years emerged, have been obliged to work themselves up to establish how they would go about their business.  I was amazed by how many wanted to come and be therapeutically listened to but who did not wish to be involved in further investigation.  In many cases, their lives had gone on and changed and while they would never lose their sense of revulsion and, frequently, their sense of self-blame for what took place, they still did not wish to go any further.</P>
        <P>I think of the 1,090 victims of abuse who brought their experience to the confidential committee on an entirely confidential basis.  It was a wonderful service to give them and they in turn availed of it.  However, in so doing, one wonders how much more dreadful it must have been for them as they went into their abuse and relived it.  How awful to bring back the ghosts of <Col N="254"/>the past and all that happened to them.  It must have raised questions about how they now would cope with what would become a changed and altered life.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks on the holding of public hearings into a number of specific institutions.  Members have seen sight of and have heard of them.  I also understand the commission will publish a report.  I am glad that report will be published as soon as it is completed, which is, rightly, part of the remit of this independent commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was interested in the last sentence, &ldquo;The work of the commission and its public report is an opportunity for them [the victims] to receive the kind of respectful and sympathetic hearing to which they are entitled.&rdquo;  Of course it is, but one wonders, because in the nature of things this will be sensationalist.  To those who have suffered, this may mean the reopening of wounds.  I commend all who came to the commission, whether on a confidential basis or an investigative basis, but what must it have cost them?  I spoke to two people in the constituency who had appointments with the committee verified some years ago.  They had to lift themselves into a proper state of mind to attend the committee and I commend them on their courage in bringing forth what happened to them.  Each had the same story to tell and each felt such things must never happen again.  A child or a person in a vulnerable situation should never again be subjected to a person in authority who puts him or her in such a position.  Some will say that child care has come a long way and we have changed how we deal with young people, but fresh difficulties constantly arise.</P>
        <P>I listened to other Members of the House this morning who spoke of judgments yesterday.  Deputy Brian Hayes talked about the need for proper vetting procedures for those in authority around young people.  All these are fresh areas.  Only in recent years we saw the dreadful Soham case involving two young girls.  There were other cases previously.  For all the good work carried out by this commission there are still hidden areas of life where young people are abused and their rights impinged upon.  The manner in which they should be sustained in life is constantly being overridden.</P>
        <P>I hope the commission&rsquo;s report and conclusions will point the way forward.  Those of us on relevant committees or working in the area of child protection and children&rsquo;s rights will learn many lessons from this and the silence endured by so many for so long will never be allowed again.  The young voices that say what they must will be listened to, not only because we must listen but because we respect them.  We must transmit an aura of respect towards young people.  Young people should no longer merely be seen and not heard; they should be heard and seen.  We are now engaging in the re-establishment of children&rsquo;s rights in our committee and we seek to ensure young people find their voices and have the necessary confidence in themselves to go through their youth and teenage years and emerge as confident adults.  That is what we all hope for.</P>
        <P>I support the request for extra time and I look forward with alacrity to the publication of the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I will start at the point at which my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, started by saying I agree entirely with everything he said and I hope to add to it.  This commission of inquiry, which has been sitting for a long time, has the important task of looking to the past and reporting on what occurred in our residential institutions.  In the context of the investigation committee, it will seek to determine some of the perpetrators who behaved in an abusive fashion towards children in residential institutions.  However, the report the commission publishes can only name those who have already been convicted; it cannot name those who have not been brought before the courts.</P><Col N="255"/>
        <P Just="Left">The commission is essentially concerned with the past, and its report, when published, will teach us lessons for the future, but I am concerned about the present.  I am concerned that no one in this House, on the Government benches or in government, should rest easy in the belief that the type of abuse that was perpetrated in residential institutions and is currently being investigated as happening in the past is not occurring today.  Children may be victims of both sexual and physical abuse, if not in residential institutions then in homes across the length and breadth of the country.</P>
        <P>The remit of the HSE as a child protection authority is clearly described in legislation beginning with the 1991 Act, to which amendments have since been made.  On the Order of Business today the T&aacute;naiste referred me to the 1991 Act, which replaced the Children Act 1908.  The difficulty with this area is that we have always had legislation on our Statute Book designed to provide protection for children.  What have been lacking are services to ensure the legislation is enforced, support services to ensure families in difficulty are provided with the assistance they require and protection services to ensure that where children are truly at risk a proper assessment of the extent of that risk is made, measures are taken and interventions are made to provide child protection.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe the position today remains a national scandal.  As one who has worked in this area, I despair of attracting the media&rsquo;s attention to the extent of what is occurring.  Some of the social workers in this area also despair of attracting the media&rsquo;s attention.  We all know that unless the media highlights an issue, the Government feels cosy enough to proceed as if nothing is wrong and ignore it.  The &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme in recent weeks did some service in this area but its revelations have not been followed up by the print media.  The print media will get excited at some point in the future when it is discovered that a child on an at-risk register, whose circumstances were not properly investigated, has been killed or admitted to hospital with appalling injuries resulting in criminal charges.</P>
        <P>I want to make it clear in this House today that there is a major problem in this area.  We should not discount what social workers say, though the credibility of some of what they say is often derided either by the Government or HSE managers to create the facade of a functioning child protection system.  We do not have such a system; we have a seriously dysfunctional system with social and child care workers who are overworked and under extraordinary pressure.  They know that if they make a decision that proves to be wrong they may be publicly pilloried at some stage in the future.  More than 150 social workers in the child care service of the HSE are currently on some form of leave.  Some are on maternity leave and some are simply on leave due to the impact of the pressures of the job.  Social workers in child care teams who are on leave are not being replaced and other social workers are consequently under huge pressure.</P>
        <P>Sadly, not only will children who have been reported to the HSE die and be seriously sexually and physically abused, it is inevitable that in ten or 15 years&rsquo; time there will be yet another commission of inquiry into what occurred in the years 1990 to 2010 and what went wrong.  The Children First guidelines require that children in residential or foster care have an allocated social worker to review how matters are proceeding and deal with problems that arise.  There are currently children in residential care who have no functioning allocated social workers.  We have children in residential care who, if they are experiencing the type of abuse being investigated by the Ryan commission, do not know how to get help because no special system has been put in place by the HSE to facilitate emergency access by children in residential or foster care to people independent of the system that first put them into care.  What is happening on the ground is a scandal.</P><Col N="256"/>
        <P Just="Left">The T&aacute;naiste, as happens in this House on a daily basis, ducked the issue during the Order of Business this morning.  A game of chess is played in this House on a daily basis on the Order of Business and during Leaders&rsquo; Questions whereby questions are put and issues raised that might get ten seconds of exposure on the 9 o&rsquo;clock news or be reported in the following day&rsquo;s news media, and then everyone moves on to the next issue.  Opposition parties that keep pushing issues are then derided by Government on the basis that they have nothing positive to say.</P>
        <P>The positive thing I do have to say is that we have some amazingly able, hard-pressed professionals employed within the HSE who are constantly engaged in providing a fire-fighting service in child protection.  However, the service that needs to be provided is beyond them.  I believe it is beyond the managerial sector of the HSE, which is supposedly in charge.  Under the Child Care Act 1991 the HSE has an obligation to publish annual reports on the child protection service.  The report for 2005 went to the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children around the end of June or beginning of July 2007 and did not surface anywhere in public until it was quietly put on the HSE website on 28 February 2008.  It has never been formally published as a bound volume.  The 2006 report still has not been published, and the 2007 report probably will not be published in 2008 despite promises to the contrary.</P>
        <P>Among a whole series of scandals, the first major scandal is that the Minister of State with responsibility for children and, apparently, the HSE management structure have no up-to-date information on the number of children reported to be at risk.  These children&rsquo;s cases have been adjudged to be serious and given priority listing, but the files are sitting in a drawer somewhere awaiting the allocation of a social worker so that a child and family assessment can be undertaken.  There are hundreds of such cases throughout the country.  I have attempted, through D&aacute;il questions and through the HSE, to obtain the details of that information.  The HSE either is deliberately concealing it or does not know it.  I suspect that its systems are so poor that it does not know.</P>
        <P>The Children First guidelines are not being applied uniformly.  I will give the 2006 statistics in this respect.  In the Dublin-mid-Leinster area there were 2,203 reports of possible child abuse &mdash; as opposed to neglect &mdash; which generated 1,546 genuine concerns, with the ultimate proportion of confirmed cases of abuse at 27%.  In the southern HSE region, there were 2,556 reports of child abuse in 2006 &mdash; in other words, 350 more than in Dublin-mid-Leinster.  Of these, 728 generated concern &mdash; less than half the number that generated concern within the Dublin-mid-Leinster region &mdash; and the proportion of confirmed cases of abuse was 7%.  Is anyone telling me that the Children First guidelines are being uniformly applied to provide child protection?  In Dublin-mid-Leinster, out of 2,203 reports of children at risk, 27% were confirmed to be genuine, while in the Southern region, out of 2,556 reports, only 7% were confirmed to be genuine.  Based on these statistics, child abusers who go and live in Cork are more likely to be allowed to abuse their children continuously for years because no one will ever properly investigate it.  This is a major scandal and a disgrace.</P>
        <P>On the Order of Business today the T&aacute;naiste waffled about the 1991 Act.  I know it exists.  What I want is a Government that can come to this House and tell us that we have the structures and resources in place to protect children, that we are uniformly applying the Children First guidelines, and that if a child is determined to be at serious risk, that child&rsquo;s circumstances will be investigated &mdash; if not within a matter of hours then within days &mdash; and the necessary social work intervention will take place.  At the moment that assurance cannot be given.  That is a disgrace and a scandal.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="257"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to say a few words on this very difficult subject.  In my experience as a long-time Member of the House I find it difficult to understand, as Deputy Shatter also pointed out, why successive Governments, particularly those we have had for the last eight or ten years, cannot say with conviction that children&rsquo;s interests will be protected.  In my area, which is very rural, the system is so patchy that after five o&rsquo;clock in the evening there are no emergency social workers available because of insufficient staff at HSE level.  I know for a fact that were it not for the security rooms in Garda stations there would be no place for some children late at night.  Emergencies of this type happen at a particular time.  Nobody knows when the flashpoint will come.  It is at that hour that the systems matter.  Either they are in place and can be activated or they are not.  If for any reason there is a need for intervention due to physical or other types of abuse, unless there is a co-ordinated system whereby people who care for those children &mdash; which may not even include their own parents, as we well know &mdash; can remove them to safety, nothing can be done.  This is a black spot in the administration of the system.  It is full of such black spots.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is nothing wrong with the security rooms, although they are no place for children to be.  However, it is hard to imagine that when there is a report of possible abuse in a dysfunctional family at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the only people who can appear at that door on behalf of the State are members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is no place for them.</P>

	<P>This is not happening on a once-off basis.  I must be thankful that at least they are there, although they are not trained for it and do not have the know-how to deal with such situations.  It is a far cry from a case conference with multidisciplinary agencies involved in child care.  I am not a professional in this area but I have been out long enough to see a lot of things happen.  It is that bad now.  I know what I am saying.  Unless it is implemented on the ground, having all the legislation in the world is no use.  As Deputies Brian Hayes and Shatter stated, the true test is to make the entire range of facilities available during emergencies.  Being unavailable day or night would be the weakest link in the chain.</P>
        <P>Regarding the annual figures released by child support and inquiry lines, not every telephone call is bona fide.  I have no way of knowing the details, but I assume that some of the calls are frivolous.  That there is a yearly increase in the number of those who call for help, however, shows how society is not kind to the people in question.  The saddest feature of the issue is that, despite our affluence and while I am unable to provide researched figures, I can say anecdotally that there is more child abuse of a certain type than was the case previously, namely, child neglect rather than sexual abuse.  When most people consider child abuse, they refer to child sexual abuse.  It would be foolish of us to believe that child sexual abuse has abated, but child neglect is increasing significantly.  I do not know why this is the case.  Parents and the wider community are supposed to be better educated and to have access to facilities to which their own parents did not, but the situation on the ground is different.  We must review the education system.  It is not a sexy comment to make and will not send writers rushing for their biros.</P>
        <P>Those who assume responsibility for raising children do so under better circumstances than prevailed 25 or 30 years ago.  They live in better houses and most have better forms of transport.  If so, why do so many four year olds and five year olds sometimes not see their parents or guardians for two days?  These are the facts.  We can blame everyone, and the Government is far from blameless because the HSE has authority in this regard.  The Government was unable to make the investment in the system necessary to protect the most vulnerable people during our years of affluence.  Why would the State turn its back on, for example, an innocent five year old?</P><Col N="258"/>
        <P>We are debating a motion to allow the commission to continue its work, in respect of which I congratulate it.  It has been examining what was unarguably one of Ireland&rsquo;s murkiest periods.  I hope that everyone associated with the savage regime will be brought before the courts according to due process.  It is remarkable that, despite having addressed one historical black spot, the State cannot answer questions concerning the abuses that are still being perpetrated within families.  The State has no control.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shatter mentioned that there is no shortage of legislation.  Its implementation, however, has always been difficult.  We must consider the significant pressures placed on families, as the situation extends beyond children alone.  Irrespective of whichever Act is in place, we must ensure that the chain is not broken in terms of administration or service delivery at 5 p.m., 10 a.m. or 3 a.m.   The last place children at risk should be at night is in Garda stations.  We must thank the Garda for doing this job when no one else would.</P>

The veil of secrecy and willing ignorance that used to permeate the question should not be an edifice of our evolving society.</P>
        <P>I note and am surprised by the dearth of Government speakers.  I would have expected more participation by Government Members in light of the fact that the Government has responsibility for this matter in the first instance.</P>

	<P>This is not a reflection on the Minister of State or his colleagues.  As public representatives, we deal with situations in which people have expressed concerns about child abuse, neglect and welfare, aspects that constitute a major part of an issue that has always been addressed in retrospect.  We must address the issue in advance.  Barnardos and other groups are promoting the necessary protection of children.  This is not being done to the exclusion of parents, as we must proceed with their co-operation, help and support in instances of possible neglect.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I will never understand how, in cases of child sexual abuse, perpetrators can abuse small, innocent children of less than two years of age for a long period and presume that society will never catch them.  This is a reflection on our society.  While people have told me that there have always been signs, I do not know whether that is the case.  However, it is extraordinary that such abuse can continue for years without coming to light.  We now know that, in some cases, abuses were brought to people&rsquo;s attention but the children were not believed.  The moral of the story is that, as our society evolves and becomes more impersonal and based on financial gain and materialism, we must reconsider this issue.  For all we know, serious offences of this order are occurring as we speak.</P>
        <P>The more impersonal society becomes and the more we all withdraw into our own day-to-day affairs, the less chance there is that any of us will be in a position to point out when something is wrong with a particular situation because, through our observations as a neighbour, teacher or doctor, we have knowledge that nobody else may have.  It is extremely important that action is taken when something is brought to the attention of the authorities.  The first issue is that the charges must be authenticated and, to do so, they must be investigated at an early stage.  It is not sufficient simply to ignore the concerns that have been expressed <Col N="259"/>and hope there will be developments which make it easier to intervene.  I emphasise that this is not to suggest that the State should come between parents and children.</P>
        <P>In recent years, I have written repeatedly to three Departments and raised questions in this House in regard to child welfare issues and situations where there are serious family problems.  There are bodies with responsibilities for child welfare issues under the remit of the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children.  There is clearly a problem when we have three Departments with responsibility in this area but none of them is taking it.  That is one of the lessons we should learn.  To be fair to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda was at least in a position to take some action.  However, if everybody else opts out and there are long reports from social workers which are not acted upon, we are wasting our time.  There is nothing more demeaning and annoying to any professional or politician than repeatedly making a particular case only to find it is ignored.</P>
        <P>All the relevant departmental agencies, whether in the realms of education, justice or health, must accept and live up to their responsibilities and ensure they carry out the particular function or role assigned to them under legislation.  Otherwise, another politician will be standing in this Chamber in 50 years&rsquo; time asking why something was not done at an earlier stage and why nobody intervened.</P>
        <P>Other Members referred to the abuse perpetrated against children by people in authority, whether within families or in the spheres of health, education and so on.  Abuse of an innocent child by a person in authority is appalling.  There has been a reasonably thorough review of cases going back over the past 25 or 30 years and much nefarious material which was previously kept hidden has come to public attention.  That is to be welcomed.  However, the vetting of people who are in direct contact with children must be examined to a far greater extent than heretofore.  Far more stringent vetting procedures are in operation in other jurisdictions to the extent that convicted sexual abusers and paedophiles from other countries have moved to this State and we have no effective means of tracking such movements.  Our response is haphazard and inadequate.</P>
        <P>I referred earlier to the impersonal nature of our society.  Recent events in Austria should be sufficient to illustrate what can happen on their own doorsteps when people turn a blind eye.  Something similar could be happening in this State.  We must have a system which guarantees that legitimately expressed concerns about the welfare of any child are investigated.  We, as legislators, and society in general have a duty to ensure that persons in positions of power and authority over children are carefully vetted and that no such persons use their power to abuse children, sexually or otherwise.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Neville for giving way to allow me to make a contribution on this motion.  I have spoken on several occasions in the past on the role and functions of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  When the amending legislation came before the House, I spoke at length on the situation of those children who were in residential care during the years in question and who were ignored by the commission.  Sadly, there has been no change in this regard.  There are two specific categories of children in residential care who remain in the shadows and the Government has sought resolutely to keep their experience out of the public domain.  One of these groups comprises those children in State residential institutions who were used as guinea pigs in vaccine trials without their consent.  The Government has used the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse as a fig-leaf to ensure their experience is swept under the carpet and that we never receive answers to our questions about the prevailing medical ethos in the 1960s and 1970s.</P><Col N="260"/>
        <P>Two separate sets of trials were carried out on children in State homes, the first during 1960-61 and the second in the early 1970s, up to at least 1973.  I understand there was a later trial but I do not have the details of that to hand.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was a great upsurge in the number of severe adverse reactions in children who received the three-in-one DTP Trivax vaccine, manufactured by Wellcome.  The Eastern Health Board&rsquo;s records for 1973 show that the official in charge of the administration of the vaccine within the health board&rsquo;s region was inundated with reports of severe reactions among children.  In the first six months of 1973, in particular, more than 80 reported adverse reactions were recorded.  Three years earlier, in 1970, a senior scientist in Wellcome had warned in a memo to senior colleagues that if further reports of severe reactions to the vaccine were received, it might be desirable to cease its manufacture altogether.</P>
        <P>The 1973 vaccine trial involved an institution and a comparative control group outside that institution.  A total of 116 children were involved, 59 from the community and 57 from two children&rsquo;s homes in the Dublin area.  The children in the community were given the normal commercial vaccine, while those in care were used as the guinea pigs for the new trial vaccine that was being studied at the time.  The same circumstances prevailed in the other trials.  This was completely contrary to any ethical standards.  The results of the study were inconclusive in that no significant difference between the vaccines emerged.</P>
        <P>The trials beg a number of questions which remain to be answered. To date, however, no answers have been forthcoming.  The Government referred this issue to the Laffoy Commission but it was subsequently challenged in the courts.  The Government came back with an amendment to refer it to this commission but that did not happen because of the court challenge.  No worthwhile information has come into the public domain in regard to what occurred in those institutions, even though State employed medical personnel were involved in administering the trials.</P>
        <P>The investigations were prompted by severe adverse reactions to vaccines manufactured by Wellcome and administered in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Among the vaccines administered was batch No. 3741, which was given to a child called Kenneth Best.  When Kenneth Best&rsquo;s case came before the High Court in 1991, Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton described Wellcome as negligent and criticised the company&rsquo;s quality control procedures.  While this case ended up in the High Court, matters came to a head in 1977 for many of the other victims of vaccine damage, when the then Minister for Health established an expert medical group to examine claims that persons had been permanently damaged by the whooping cough vaccination.  The group found a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible for damage in 16 of the 93 cases presented to it.  At an early stage in the investigation and following the expert group&rsquo;s initial findings, officials advised that it would be inconsistent and inconclusive not to concede proper compensation.  As Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods received the recommendations but he decided to ignore his officials&rsquo; advice and the Fianna F&aacute;il Government of the time pursued a policy of buying off parents by offering a one-off <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &pound;10,000.  The payment was accepted by 13 of the 16 families, largely because of the severe financial pressures they faced as a result of their children&rsquo;s profound disabilities.  The Best family declined the offer and received over &pound;2.9 million in the High Court in the early 1990s.</P>
        <P>Since that offer, it has taken the Government 20 years to reconsider the issue and little has been done in the intervening period by the Department of Health and Children to adequately compensate the children in question.  Following a meeting with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in spring 2002, the Government undertook a preliminary review of vaccine damage compensation schemes in other countries.  The vast majority of EU countries, <Col N="261"/>as well as many other developed countries, have introduced compensation schemes because it is well known that a small number of children are profoundly damaged by the administration of vaccines.  This review was submitted in 2004 and gathered dust for more than two years before the present Minister stated she was considering the feasibility of introducing a vaccine damage compensation scheme.  It took her a long time to consider that scheme.  On the eve of the last general election, she announced that a steering group with specific terms of reference was being established and would furnish its report as a matter of urgency.  Almost 18 months later, we still have no report.</P>
        <P>This Government has turned its back on these children.  Those who were used as guinea pigs have not yet received answers regarding why they were used, why consent was not sought and what type of concoction was administered.  Those who have been brain damaged as a result of State promoted vaccination programmes must continue to fight for basic services.  Their parents are worried sick about what will happen to their children after they pass away.  It is time for decisive action in this area.</P>
        <P>I also want to speak about children put into State care after arriving here unaccompanied from outside the EU.  Since 2000, 441 children put into the care of the HSE have gone missing and 388 remain unaccounted for.  This figure represents 88% of the total number put into care.  This is another scandal which will require investigation at some point in the future.  It is believed that some of these children have found their way into the sex industry here or in other EU member states.  It is appalling that the Government continues to ignore this issue just because these children are not Irish citizens and do not have family members in the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this serious issue.  We are pleased to support the motion providing for a full and complete report.</P>
        <P>Each year, thousands of children are traumatised by physical, sexual and emotional abusers or by care givers who neglect them, making child abuse as common as it is shocking.  The scars can be deep and long-lasting, and they affect society as well as the abused children.  Most of us cannot imagine what would make an adult use violence against a child.  Indeed, the worse the behaviour, the more unimaginable it seems.  However, the incidence of parents and other caregivers consciously or even willfully committing acts that harm the children they are supposed to be nurturing is a sad fact of human society that cuts across all lines of ethnicity and class.  Regardless of whether the abuse is rooted in the perpetrator&rsquo;s mental illness, substance abuse or an inability to cope, the psychological result in terms of deep emotional scars and feelings of worthlessness are often the same for each abused child.</P>
        <P>The four primary types of child abuse are physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect.  While the first two categories receive the most attention, perhaps because they involve physical violence, neglect is by far the most common form of child abuse and accounts for more than 60% of all cases of child maltreatment.  Neglect is a pattern of failing to provide for a child&rsquo;s basic needs to the extent that his or her physical and psychological well-being are damaged or endangered.  In neglecting a child, the parents or care givers are simply choosing not to do their jobs.  The three basic types of neglect are physical, educational and emotional.  Physical neglect involves the failure to provide adequate food, clothing or hygiene, reckless disregard for a child&rsquo;s safety, refusal to provide or delay in providing necessary health care or abandoning children without providing for their care.  Forms of educational neglect include permitting a child to miss too many days of school or refusing to follow up on obtaining services for a child&rsquo;s special educational needs.  Emotional neglect is usually identified as inadequate nurturing and affection, permitting a child to drink alcohol or use recreational drugs, failing to intervene when the child demonstrates anti-social behaviour or refusing to provide necessary psychological care.</P><Col N="262"/>
        <P>Physical child abuse comprises an act of aggression by an adult which causes injury in a child, even if the adult did not intend injury.  Such acts of aggression include striking a child with the hand, fist or foot, or with an object; burning the child with a hot object; shaking, pushing or throwing a child; pinching or biting a child; or pulling a child by the hair.  Acts of physical aggression of this nature account for between 15% and 20% of documented child abuse each year.</P>
        <P>Many physically abusive parents and care givers insist that their actions are simply forms of discipline or ways to make a child learn to behave.  This is not acceptable.  Physically abusive parents have issues of anger, excessive need for control or immaturity that make them unable or unwilling to see their level of aggression as inappropriate.</P>
        <P>Occasionally the very youngest children, even babies not yet born, suffer physical abuse.  Due to the fact that many chemicals pass from a pregnant woman&rsquo;s system to that of a foetus, a mother&rsquo;s use of drugs or alcohol during pregnancy can cause neurological and physiological damage to her unborn child.  I refer, for example, to the effects of foetal alcohol syndrome.  Mothers can pass on drugs or alcohol in breast milk.</P>
        <P>Another form of child abuse is shaken baby syndrome.  The latter involves a frustrated care giver shaking a baby roughly to make it stop crying.  A baby&rsquo;s neck muscles cannot support its head in the early stages of development and if the baby is shaken, its brain will bounce around inside its skull.  This can cause damage which often leads to severe neurological problems and even death.</P>
        <P>Sexual abuse accounts for approximately 10% of child abuse.  An adult who sexually abuses a child or adolescent is usually a person the child knows and is supposed to trust such as a relative, a child care provider, a family friend, a neighbour, a teacher, a coach or a member of the clergy.  More than 80% of sex offenders are known to their child or adolescent victims.  It is important to understand that no matter what the adult says in defence of his or her actions, the child did not invite the sexual activity and the adult&rsquo;s behaviour is absolutely wrong.  Sexual abuse is never the fault of the child.</P>
        <P>Children are psychologically unable to deal with sexual stimulation.  Even toddlers who have not formulated the idea that sexual abuse is wrong will develop problems as a result of over-stimulation.  Older children who know and care for their abusers know that the sexual behaviour is wrong.  However, they may feel trapped by feelings of loyalty and affection for the person abusing them.  Abusers ensure that their victims do not tell and they threaten children with violence or ostracism.  The shame associated with the sexual activity makes a child particularly reluctant to tell.  When sexual abuse occurs within the family, children can be concerned that other members of their family will not believe them or, as is often the case, will be angry with them if they tell.  The layer of shame that accompanies sexual abuse makes the behaviour doubly traumatising.</P>
        <P>Children who have suffered sexual abuse often show no physical signs and the abuse goes undetected unless a physician detects evidence of forced sexual activity.  There are, however, behavioural clues to sexual abuse.  These include inappropriate interest in or knowledge of sexual acts; seductive behaviour; reluctance or refusal to undress in front of others; extra aggression or, at the other end of the spectrum, extra compliance; and fear of a particular person or family member.  Children who use the Internet are also vulnerable to come-ons from adults on-line.  Among the warning signs of on-line sex child abuse are if a child spends large amounts of time on-line, particularly at night; if there is pornography on his or her computer; if he or she is receiving phone calls from or making them to people his or her parents do not know; if he or she receives mail, gifts, or packages from someone his or her parents do not <Col N="263"/>know; if he or she turns his or her computer monitor off or quickly changes the screen when someone enters the room; or if he or she becomes withdrawn from his or her family.</P>
        <P>Emotional child abuse involves behaviour which interferes with a child&rsquo;s mental health or social development.  One website describes it as &ldquo;the systematic tearing down of another human being&rdquo;.  Such abuse can range from verbal insults to acts of terror and is almost always a factor in the other three categories of abuse.  While emotional abuse does not involve the infliction of physical pain or inappropriate physical contact, it can have more lasting negative psychological effects than either physical abuse or sexual abuse.</P>
        <P>Examples of emotional child abuse include verbal abuse, which involves belittling or shaming a child by name-calling, making negative comparisons to others or telling a child that he or she is &ldquo;no good&rdquo;, &ldquo;worthless&rdquo; or &ldquo;a mistake&rdquo; and habitual blaming, which involves telling him or her that everything is his or her fault; withholding affection, which involves ignoring or disregarding a child, and a lack of affection and warmth; extreme punishment, which involves actions that are meant to isolate and terrorise a child, such as tying him or her to a fixture or an item of furniture or locking him or her in a closet or dark room; and corruption, which involves causing a child to witness or participate in inappropriate behaviour, such as criminal activity, drug or alcohol abuse or acts of violence.</P>
        <P>Emotional abuse can come not only from adults, but also from other children.  I refer here to siblings, neighbourhood or school bullies and schools which permit a culture of social ostracism.  There is a need for a full debate on bullying in the House, particularly in the context of the phenomenon of cyber bullying.  The signs of emotional child abuse include apathy, depression and hostility.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and constructive comments in respect of this matter.  I also thank them for their pledged support for the motion.</P>
        <P>A number of issues were raised.  Deputy Brian Hayes referred to the role played by the Department of Education and Science in 2002 and subsequently.  Mr. Matthias Kelly was appointed by the then Minister in 2003 to review the Department&rsquo;s processes and procedures relating to the making of discoveries by it to the commission.  Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s interim report reached the conclusion that &ldquo;the difficulties over discovery were not due to obstruction or concealment but rather due to poor historic record storage systems and misunderstandings as to what in fact was required&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Deputies Brian Hayes, Quinn, Shatter, Connaughton, Durkan and Naughten referred to the current situation and the situation that will obtain in the future.  In many respects, this motion deals with past events.  A number of topics were raised in this regard, including that of child protection guidelines.  The Department issued guidelines, in line with the Children First policy document, to primary and post-primary schools in respect of dealing with and reporting child abuse.  The Department has also provided training to designated liaison persons on the implementation of these guidelines as part of a range of measures, including the Stay Safe programme, relating to child protection.  I will be happy to provide Deputies with details of this training if required.</P>
        <P>Deputies Brian Hayes and Quinn also referred to child protection procedures in general.  Having regard to the future, the Department will conduct a review of its procedures in light of the publication of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the review of Children First and the national child protection guidelines and in the event of the ratification of the referendum relating to children.  This is an ongoing concern to the Department of Education and Science.</P><Col N="264"/>
        <P>I thank Deputies O&rsquo;Rourke and Neville for their caring and compassionate insight in the cases we are dealing with.  Both clearly have an intimate knowledge of these cases and have interacted with the people who have come before the commission.  They brought an insight into the human tragedy that all this involves.</P>
        <P>The issue of vetting was raised by Deputies Brian Hayes and Shatter.  Special arrangements for newly-qualified teachers are co-ordinated through the teaching council.  Currently, existing teachers are not vetted but the Department is working with the appropriate authorities to consider how best to put the appropriate arrangements in place as the roll-out of the Garda vetting unit expands.  Irrespective of the position on vetting, where facts are brought to the information of the school, the school must be vigilant, check references and probe any gaps in records.</P>
        <P>I probably do not have time to go into the indemnity agreements now but the decision to establish the redress scheme was made regardless of whether the religious congregations would contribute to the cost.  The State had a duty to make amends for the abuse of children placed in institutions by the courts.  Nevertheless it was considered desirable that the congregations should make a meaningful contribution and agreement was reached on the provision of &euro;128 million.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of the negotiations, the Department of Finance had recommended that the negotiating team should strive for a 50% contribution from the congregations.  However, it was subsequently recognised that this was not achievable and the Department of Finance was satisfied with the contribution of &euro;120 million.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>

	<P>As I was saying when the debate adjourned last evening, the responsibilities likely to fall on the proposed Dublin transport authority, DTA, are great and I hope they do not conflict with other statutory bodies and authorities.  I hope we do not end up with a turf war between the various bodies that deal with local issues such as roads, transport and education, as access and transport with respect to education is very important.  </P>
        <P>Another issue I meant to deal with last night which will bear a further visit is the question of the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility to the House.  I do not agree with the regularly held belief that if the Minister is not directly running the show, he or she has no responsibility to the House. <Col N="265"/> The Minister has responsibility for every penny of the budget coming from his or her Department.  The Minister has responsibility for the parties to which this funding goes, as well as an onus to extract from those bodies information raised by Members of the House at any particular time.</P>
        <P>The practice has developed over the years where it is very handy for Ministers to opt out and say they are not directly responsible because the area is run by the HSE or some other body; in this case it would be the Dublin transport authority.  The Minister appears to have no responsibility.  At what stage does responsibility go along with allocation of money?  In every other show on Earth, one follows the other automatically.  It is not so in this House, and that is for the convenience of Ministers.  That is fine when in government but as I have often said in the past, it may be a long time coming but everybody will get a touch of the Opposition, and then it will not be so nice.  It will be too late to change the rules at that stage.</P>
        <P>We must be absolutely clear in the running of this House.  I was delighted last night to see two relevant Ministers come in here to answer matters on the Adjournment.  I particularly commend the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste for that.  For a long time, we in the Opposition have been treated with contempt, with one particular Minister of State coming in to take replies to two, three or four matters on the Adjournment.  If those in the House begin to treat it with contempt, the public will eventually conclude we should be treated the same way.</P>
        <P>On the transport issue, I have repeatedly put down questions on the convenient locations of bus stops and their safe construction.  It is a simple matter that encourages the use of public transport.  A stop should be well located and appointed, sheltered and properly maintained.  The reply which comes back again and again is that the Minister for Transport has no responsibility to the House, or this is a matter for the Garda.  I do not know what the Garda should be doing about the matter except in regard to safety issues.  The Minister for Transport should have overall responsibility in this area.  Two or three years ago when some of my constituents were tragically killed at a bus stop in the city, who came into the House to explain the matter but the Minister for Transport?  He is the Minister with responsibility.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to convey to his colleagues some hint that we might expect a response that deals with the issue.  It is helpful to Ministers if this is done in the interests of accountability and transparency, rather than them avoiding responsibilities, ducking, dodging, bobbing and weaving in trying to get away from an issue.  The process would be helpful to Ministers and backbenchers on both sides of the House.  This would be beneficial to all, and consumers in particular.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When we do not get ministerial responsibility, we must write directly to the body involved.  We get a reply or a promise of a reply in an interim or holding letter, which tells us of the great things that will happen and plans in the area.  This issue relates to general locations of bus services or stops with Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath.  We are then told the request is technically impossible, unreasonable, unfeasible or cannot be done.  In writing again, we would suggest the matter be examined in a certain light.  After that a long silence ensues and after a year or so we might get another reply.</P>
        <P>If somebody thinks this is funny, he or she should wait to see what the real fun will be.  It is not smart at all but a serious deficiency in the system of accountability.  The location of bus stops and rail stations have an impact on people&rsquo;s health and safety and the quality of their daily lives.  It is the duty of those responsible to reply courteously when asked.  There should be no scheming and trying to dodge the subject.</P>
        <P>I can foresee all kinds of penalties being piled up to discourage the motorist, that hated creature who approaches the city cautiously and eventually ventures into the city if he or she can get there without being accosted by clampers and various other groups and bodies who <Col N="266"/>have other intentions.  In case anybody has failed to recognise it, the motorist contributes more than &euro;5 billion to the Exchequer annually.  That is ironic.</P>
        <P>Some of us must use our cars every day because it is impossible to get public transport.  Sometimes the public transport is not dependable or is unavailable or not available at the required times.  This is relevant to the greater Dublin area as covered by this proposal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is likely that we will be further hammered in the future.  I do not look forward to that, and I do not care what the excuse is.  Motorists are currently contributing heavily in terms of the easing of transport.  One cannot travel in any direction on a motorway without being hit by a toll.  If one is unfortunate enough to be hit once or twice in a day, one could be hit three, four or five times.  Industry and businesses are hit regularly.  We are paying in that way.  We are also paying motor tax, insurance and VRT.  I tabled various parliamentary questions to the Minister for Finance which he answered and he accepted responsibility.  The total contributed by the unfortunate motorist for daring to come into the capital city is enormous.  I would like to believe that the Dublin transport authority will not set out to screw the motorist to the ground in order to make itself appear feasible, acceptable and politically correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this legislation which will ultimately introduce the Dublin transport authority.  Anyone who wants to check the record will find that it is rather unusual for me to support the establishment of an agency.  I have in the past voiced my dissatisfaction, here and in other fora, with the notion of the Government transferring responsibility from Departments to agencies, but this is an exception.  In this case it is right to establish a transport authority to deal with difficulties that have been identified for some time.  Others have stated that it is regrettable that this legislation did not come through more quickly, but lessons have been learned in the intervening years and now is the right time to move ahead and deal with the issue. That is about to happen and I welcome it.</P>
        <P>I lived in Dublin for a number of years and I could see the difficulties encountered in traffic management with the emergence of serious congestion, with the journey of five miles from the outskirts of the city to the city centre at peak times taking one and a half to two hours.  It was clear something was wrong.  The difficulties have been exacerbated as a result of the growth in the economy.  We are thankful for that growth, but it has created pressures on our infrastructure.</P>
        <P>It has been the experience in other countries, whether in cities or on interurban routes, that regardless of how much extra infrastructure is put in place, it eventually becomes clogged because the growth in population and the use of cars always increases to fill the space available.  We need to be more creative in our use of the existing infrastructure.  The previous speaker will not be happy to hear my view on this, that we need to encourage people to use our important infrastructure and assets around the clock if possible.  I believe in congestion charges and in encouraging people to utilise basic infrastructure at times when it is available.  That is something with which the DTA must grapple, although perhaps not immediately.  If the growth projections for this city in the next ten to 15 years are right, that is something that might emerge.  I am interested to note that the legislation contains a requirement for the DTA to have a medium and a long-term strategy in terms of transport planning.  That will be helpful.</P>
        <P>There have been difficulties in the city over the years which are probably not as prevalent now as in the past.  The roll-out of broadband technologies required road openings and there was a lack of co-ordination between the various agencies involved in putting down fibre-optic lines.  A section of road would be opened one week, replaced and re-tarred, and the next week the other side of the road would be opened by some other corporate organisation to put down its fibre-optic link.  This clearly demonstrated the need for a joined-up approach, for seamless <Col N="267"/>integration across the city, given the various local authorities, agencies and stakeholders which require access to the roadways for the provision of services underneath the roads or the provision of transport services.  A co-ordinated approach is necessary.  Somebody needs to take responsibility.  It is not possible for local authorities and transport agencies to do that.  This legislation is, therefore, welcome.  The Bill is comprehensive and seeks to identify potential problems and to address them through the creation of the board and the advisory board.</P>
        <P>The way we use cars currently is not sustainable in the long term.  In that respect I disagree strongly with the previous speaker.  It is not a case of the motorist <i>versus</i> the cyclist.  We are all citizens, we are all consumers and we must all get to work.  We must all go about our business, whether it taking children to school, travelling to work or travelling for leisure.  We need to come together as a community to address the problems.  There are people who must use their cars.  Clearly there are also people who would not use their cars if there was an alternative.  For that reason the remit of the DTA in developing and promoting public transport in the city is vitally important.  It is a remit it will carry out adequately, in conjunction with the current providers of the services in question.  It is not feasible to continue to utilise cars in the way we currently do, given the expected growth in the population of the city in the next 15 to 20 years.  We need to begin planning for that.  That is not to suggest we should ban cars from the city immediately.  However, we need to consider introducing certain restrictions.</P>
        <P>Given the cost of fuel, the impact of the car on the environment and the growth in population, it is important to formulate a strategy now.  I am hopeful that the DTA will not ban the use of cars entirely but will restrict their use in a way that encourages people to use public transport services.  However, those services must be provided.  It is incumbent on the DTA to ensure there is an adequate number of buses to assist people in making that modal shift away from the car in the context of their daily commute.  Clearly there will be people for whom this will not work, but it does not have to be a case of destroying the motorist altogether.  Most people will still have a requirement for a car at other times of the day.  It is the peak periods on which we need movement.</P>
        <P>A strategic report is required.  There is a need for long-term planning and there is also a need for short-term intervention.  If the DTA is to have any credibility in the long term it must be seen to have some early wins.  It must involve itself early on and be seen to address the crisis points.  In that regard traffic management plans are probably the first area in terms of the utilisation of the existing infrastructure and of ensuring a targeted approach to increasing the level of public transport through providing a greater number of buses.  Integration is the key to the future success of the DTA.  Traffic management plans must be customer focused and not agency or organisation focused.  The biggest challenge for the DTA is to move away from the silo approach, or what consultants refer to as the vertical approach, and towards an effectively horizontal approach so that as one moves from one area to another there is seamless integration of the various organisations, local authorities etc.</P>
        <P>It will be difficult to get the agencies to work in a more collaborative way, but that is necessary if the authority is to be successful.  The focus must be on the consumers&rsquo; experience rather than on just how the agency does its business.  We need to make public transport much more user friendly and integrated ticketing will help in that regard.  More joined-up thinking is necessary in terms of connections between the rail initiatives in Dublin and the provision of feeder buses and link buses.  It is necessary also to look at the orbital routes that have been suggested.  Few of those exist in the city, as everything seems to be based on a hub and spoke effect.  The DTA will have to consider the needs of the consumer rather than the needs of the locations of bus garages.  We have to move away from that approach and become much more consumer focused.</P><Col N="268"/>
        <P>There is a need for more buses in Dublin.  Deputy Connaughton was the Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport of which I was a member and various agencies and organisations came before it.  The committee had some good debates on the bus service in Dublin.  It is important to find the methodology to increase the number of buses.  We must also examine how buses get around the city.  We have been good at planning quality bus corridors, which come from the outskirts of the city &mdash; or in some cases the outlying counties &mdash; and make their way to the city centre.  However, in the final mile and a half or two miles they get completely blocked up.  We encourage people to travel by bus from Naas, Bray or wherever and then it takes an hour and a half to get from, for example, Donnybrook to the city centre.  Clearly, people are not happy with that experience and it can make them decide to drive the next time they travel.  The DTA needs to finds a methodology that unblocks the city centre to allow buses to move more freely to ensure a better user experience.</P>
        <P>Traffic management in the city is critical to the success of the extra use of public transport.  We must be prepared to take tough decisions to get that right.  For that reason, I believe it will be necessary to consider congestion charges, which have been successfully implemented in other countries.  In addition, certain sections of the city may have to become car-free zones.  While that may be a difficult task initially, it will promote the usage of public transport.  In conjunction with that, we have to be assured that the capacity is available on the public transport network so that when people are asked to take the ultimate step, they can be accommodated.</P>
        <P>The fundamental aspect of the Bill is the promotion of the principle of co-operation and collaboration between the various organs of State.  That is helpful because we have to move away from the old-fashioned demarcation lines that existed in those companies and agencies and move towards a more horizontal structure.  The recently published OECD report, Ireland: Towards an Integrated Public Service, refers to that and to the notion of networked approaches to working.  That is a good example, as the DTA will have to provide a networked approach to finding a solution to transport problems in Dublin.  I wish it well in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is relatively easy for us to talk in this House about building the networks, making the connections between the agencies, breaking down the barriers that exist and getting rid of demarcation lines.  That in itself will be difficult, and it is clear that the management of change, especially in any State agency, will be difficult.  There are vested interests in all of those organisations who will resist change.  No doubt they will not find it easy to move into a more collaborative environment.  Nevertheless, we have to move in that direction.  I hope the various stakeholders and interests in those organisations &mdash; be they union or management &mdash; are prepared to take that leap for the greater good, and in the interests of the delivery of a public transport service in Dublin city that is focused on customers rather than just being about the agency continuing to deliver the service it believes is relevant.  That is where some of the difficulties may lie.  The authority has the powers to carry out the necessary change.</P>
        <P>I welcome the mandate and the remit of the authority.  The area defined as the greater Dublin area has been extended.  That is welcome, given the potential for population increase in the long term in those areas.  One needs to begin the process of improving public transport in the outlying areas from which people commute.  Local authorities and other bodies will not come together of their own volition in spite of the regional authority structure.  The kind of collaboration and co-operation that takes place between local authorities is not in line with the expectation that came with the establishment of regional authorities.  I am happy the authority will have a strong mandate to be able to deliver the outcomes that are required.</P><Col N="269"/>
        <P>I welcome also the fact that the DTA will have the power to take over projects itself if it deems it necessary.  In some cases there may be resistance or a level of inertia in moving forward and it is important that the authority will have the power to take over and drive those projects.  The fact that the authority will be able to give mandatory directions to implementing agencies is also important because an authority without the powers vested in it to make things happen would ultimately become just another toothless organisation.</P>
        <P>I welcome especially the aspect of the Bill that deals with the transportation strategy and the land use and planning process.  We have to achieve consistency between land use and transport policy.  Deputy Connaughton and I are aware of that in terms of the western rail corridor and the difficulties encountered in that regard to re-open the line and to convince people of the long-term future and viability of the project.  Much was made of the fact that local authorities had not zoned, or in some cases had zoned in a way that was not helpful, the lands close to the rail line, especially where stations needed to be built.  It would have been better for the viability of the rail line if there were higher density residential locations in and around the villages where it was proposed to locate train stations.  That is critically important because there is little point having low density areas in proximity to rail lines because then one does not get the advantage or the usage of it.  The DTA will have to ensure that local authorities are mindful of that in their local and county development plans and that they will also have to take into account the regional planning guidelines to ensure there is joined-up thinking.  It is important for the implementation of the policy that this is set out in the Bill.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We must look also at how the DTA model can be used in other areas around the country.  It is too early to suggest how it might be rolled out, but perhaps when the legislation is reviewed at a later stage it might be possible to have regional transport authorities based on what is proposed in the greater Dublin area.  That would be helpful, for example, at the confluence of counties Clare and Limerick and Limerick city.  There is an ongoing demand from Limerick city to seek a boundary extension into County Clare, something which I obviously reject and have rejected at every opportunity.  If Limerick city moved away from the notion of having to claim territory in Clare and moved into an environment where we had a more horizontal approach to service delivery rather than just moving the demarcation lines it would be more helpful.  Perhaps the model used here might be used for other non-transport service delivery, including regional housing agencies where there can be difficulties in agreeing policies where cities and counties meet.  Perhaps lessons can be learnt from that.</P>
        <P>I welcome the amendment accepted in the Seanad to allow local authority members to sit on the board of the authority.  The restriction on elected representatives sitting on boards has appeared in a number of Bills in recent years, which is regrettable.  Being a member of a local authority should not preclude somebody serving in such a capacity based on his or her knowledge and experience which might be relevant to this matter.  I believe the knowledge and experience of a local authority member on this kind of agency would be more than helpful.</P>
        <P>In supporting the Bill and wishing it a speedy passage through the D&aacute;il I believe in the development of a single brand for public transport in the city is helpful and useful, and will ultimately drive towards a seamless integration that is customer-focused and there to serve the citizen rather than the agency promoting it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously the Bill is welcome.  I would also welcome the prompt establishment of the authority which is long overdue.  I believe the concept of such an authority was originally announced by the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan.  That announcement anticipated a body that would have much stronger powers than what has eventually come to pass in this legislation.  In November 2005 the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, <Col N="270"/>set up with great fanfare a team headed by Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony charged with establishing a Dublin transport authority.  It is only now that we are seeing this legislation.  A great deal of time has been lost in the provision of public transport.  The Government has used the establishment of this body as an excuse to avoid doing much about public transport.</P>
        <P>We have had the Dublin Transportation Office.  The general objectives of the new Dublin transport authority include in section 10(<i>a</i>) &ldquo;the development of an integrated transport system which contributes to environmental sustainability and social cohesion and promotes economic progress,&rdquo; and in section 10(<i>d</i>) &ldquo;increased use of the public transport system&rdquo;.  Section 11(<i>a</i>) outlines that among the principal functions of the authority are to &ldquo;undertake strategic planning of transport.&rdquo;  Section 11(<i>e</i>) states that the authority should secure</P>
        <P LI="1">(i) provision of public passenger transport services,</P>
        <P LI="1">(ii) provision of public transport infrastructure,</P>
        <P FLI="0">Obviously the powers are stronger than those of the Dublin Transportation Office.  However, the main function of that body, as with this body, is strategic.  Many years ago the Government announced A Platform for Change which was going to do great things for public transport most of which have never been done.  I was a member of the Dublin Regional Authority, when I was on South Dublin County Council.  Approximately seven years ago or possibly more the DTO made a presentation on A Platform for Change to a meeting of the Dublin Regional Authority.  It was stated that in a short time there would be great emphasis on the provision of additional buses by Dublin Bus.  There were also medium and long-term projects.  Most of those things never happened.  The easiest and most practical thing to do was to make major investment into Dublin Bus and provide significant numbers of buses for it.  However, that never happened.  Before the last general election we had the announcement with great fanfare of Transport 21, which was going to do the devil and all for public transport.  Again nothing significant has happened out of Transport 21.</P>
        <P>I was a councillor on South Dublin County Council in 2000 when Irish Rail gave a presentation about the Kildare route project which was supposed to be completed by 2005 with extra train stations along the route, including in Lucan.  I remember many years ago the then Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, announcing the Lucan train station.  It was only thanks to the Adamstown SDZ, which was adopted by South Dublin County Council, that the train station in Lucan was opened last year for the first time in 40 years, which happened just before the general election.</P>
        <P>Will it be any different with this new authority?  Is it more buck-passing to another body and more deferred local government?  Will there be more studies, reports, announcements and strategic plans for way off in the future?  Generally the completion dates for these projects, particularly the important ones, are after the next general election and never within the timeframe of the current Government.  The most important things that need to be done do not require a Dublin transport authority.  The most significant thing that could be done immediately with relatively moderate cost and very little digging up roads, which would be very practical and pragmatic, would be major investment in Dublin Bus.  We should provide Dublin Bus with hundreds of extra buses, which would immediately make a great improvement to Dublin&rsquo;s public transport system.  We also need to consider much cheaper bus fares.  In order to promote public transport it needs to be affordable and available, which is not the case at the moment.</P>
        <P>The short-term measure, the investment in Dublin Bus, that was announced by the DTO many years ago, as part of A Platform for Change never happened.  The opposite has happened.  The majority of the hundreds of buses promised to Dublin Bus as part of the national develop<Col N="271"/>ment plan never transpired.  As a representative for Dublin Mid-West, I am aware that last October Dublin Bus was instructed to take three 25X buses off peak time journeys from Lucan to the city centre because they did not fit into the Department of Transport&rsquo;s interpretation of the authorisation of bus departures.  Those three bus departures have been in operation for approximately three or four years.  They were notified each year to the Department of Transport but it was only last year that the Department instructed Dublin Bus to take them off.  Initially it was because the Department had not been properly notified and then it was something to do with competition.  My view is that it is a matter of interpretation.</P>
        <P>Something similar has happened in Swords, which has caused serious problems for people&rsquo;s use of public transport in Lucan and Swords.  People in those areas want to use public transport.  Of course they do not want to be stuck in traffic every day for an hour and a half coming into town and another hour and a half going home.  However, if they are left standing at the bus stop and they have a car, the chances are that they will use it.  Removing those three buses had a significant knock-on effect on people&rsquo;s ability to get buses from Lucan into town.  We cannot wait for the Dublin transport authority to be set up to sort out that problem.  The Department of Transport should find some way to allow Dublin Bus to put on those extra buses in Lucan and Swords as quickly as possible because the Department&rsquo;s actions are forcing people who were using buses to go back to using their cars.  That is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>The Government has dithered on public transport.  It has nothing to do with the setting up of authorities, it is an ideological choice on the part of the Government.  It does not want a good public transport system.  It does not want to give Dublin Bus the extra buses that could make a huge difference in terms of public transport.  That is the obvious solution because buses can travel from A to B in a way that no other form of public transport can do.  The roads and the infrastructure are already in place.  It is simply a matter of ordering the buses and putting them on the roads.</P>
        <P>I am the Labour Party spokesperson on the environment and a key issue for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is the reduction of our carbon emissions.  The Government has done nothing significant in that regard.  It is all about promoting more use of cars.  The changes in vehicle registration tax and motor tax encourage consumers to change from one form of consumption to another, albeit a better form of consumption.  They are not moving from cars to public transport.</P>
        <P>If there is a problem with the price of oil or with carbon emissions, a solution is available to the Government, namely, massive investment in Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  This issue does not just apply to Dublin, but Dublin is a key area in terms of the population and the level of emissions from cars in the city.</P>
        <P>Every so often a major announcement is made with great fanfare about the metro west, the metro east or a new Luas line for some time in the future.  We have the existing infrastructure in terms of Irish Rail and it is merely a matter of building on that.  There would be a huge pay-off in terms of our infrastructure if, for example, we completed the Kildare route project, which was stalled because the Government did not sign the orders for it.  The Government could have fast-tracked the Kildare route project if it had wanted to do so.  It could have fast-tracked the interconnector from Heuston to the city centre, which would be a hugely beneficial project in terms of the number of people that could be encouraged to use public transport.  It would not just help people along the suburban line from Kildare to the city centre but also those living in Cork, Portlaoise and other areas connected to Dublin city by that line.  With the doubling of the rail track there would be greater capacity for more trains.  The intercity trains would not be delayed by suburban trains and if we had the connector into the city centre people could travel all the way into the city.  That would be a major incentive for people to use the service. <Col N="272"/> The rail line could then be electrified and extra train stations provided, in addition to those planned.  That is something that should have been done years ago.  Will this new authority announce more Luas projects and so on rather than doing the most important functions first that would have the maximum pay-off in terms of getting people to use public transport?</P>
        <P>I have not read the Bill in any great detail but from what I can determine there is not a huge amount in it that integrates the area of land use with the provision of public transport.  There is provision in section 44(<i>c</i>) to allow the authority &ldquo;acquire and facilitate the development of land adjacent to any public transport infrastructure where such acquisition and development contribute to the economic viability of the said infrastructure whether by agreement or by means of a compulsory purchase order made ... under the Act of 2000&rdquo; &mdash; I presume that is the Planning and Development Act.  There is nothing new in that.  Local authorities can do that already.  The Government can designate strategic development zones for that type of development around public transport nodes.</P>
        <P>Under the new Planning and Development Act there is a provision in respect of compulsory purchase orders for different purposes, which I presume is the one referred to, but as far as I am aware, that was never used by the Government.  Given that that Act has been in place since 2000, why has it not been used by the Government?  Will this provision be used?  I hope it will be used.  I must give the benefit of the doubt but as far as I am aware the provision under the Planning and Development Act for a compulsory purchase order for various public projects has not been used to date.  That does not inspire confidence.</P>
        <P>To be fair, the previous Government introduced the Planning and Development Act which included the strategic development zones.  The first one adopted in the country was in Adamstown, in Lucan, which I represent.  It is a good planning tool in terms of the delivery of housing with infrastructure and, in particular, public transport.  There were requirements in the Adamstown plan to the effect that with the first 1,000 houses, a train station should be provided.  A train station was provided by the developers well in advance of that date and it is open, and I welcome that.</P>
        <P>Likewise, the Kildare route project is tied in to the development of Adamstown.  Therefore, houses cannot be developed beyond a certain stage in Adamstown unless the Kildare route project is complete.  That is welcome because there is something in place now to force both developers and the Government to implement the Kildare route project because at a certain stage the developers will not be able to build more houses unless that project is developed, and that will affect their pocket.  It will affect everybody because we need to develop housing for families to live in.  That strategic development zone is something that must be used to a much greater extent by the Government.</P>
        <P>I am aware there are other strategic development zones.  Perhaps there is a need for an audit of the strategic development zones that have been designated so far because I am aware some problems have arisen with others.  The Adamstown one worked out well and was an excellent project by the council and everyone involved, but I am aware problems have arisen.  Now that this area has been examined and we know it works, the Government should consider whether improvements need to be made to that process.  That is the way forward in terms of planning and development to ensure we get public transport with development of housing and that housing is developed in the right areas.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government published draft new planning guidelines and spoke about amending the Act, which would mean that councillors&rsquo; decisions would have to be consistent with the guidelines, but that would not be a very strong provision.  A much more significant measure would be needed along the lines of the section in <Col N="273"/>the Planning and Development Act on the strategic development zones, which clearly sets out what should be in the those zones.  That is what is needed in terms of amending our planning laws.</P>
        <P>There is huge potential in the upcoming development plans for county councils to rezone land wherever they wish.  South Dublin County Council will begin dealing with its new county development plan next year and, therefore, it will be adopted by 2010.  I presume the same is the case in other local authorities, but what is to stop them from doing many unsustainable land zonings without regard to this?  Will this authority be set up in time and will it be able to do anything?  I do not believe so.</P>
        <P>An attempt was made in my area recently to vary the county development plan in part of County Dublin.  I was opposed to that rezoning and thankfully it was defeated because it would have been unsustainable.  It was not near any public transport nodes.  It would have led to urban sprawl in a rural area and issues about connections to water, waste facilities and so on would have arisen.</P>
        <P>Some months ago the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government provided information about a survey he had done on climate change.  The information in the public domain indicated that 81% of people were in favour of carbon taxes, which I found hard to believe.  I sought further information and eventually managed to get the full details of that survey.  When people were asked whether they wanted to pay 8% on car fuel &mdash; and other types of fuel &mdash; almost 50% were opposed to it.  In reality the opposition was probably even greater because people were asked about carbon taxes and other specifics in the context of a survey exploring reaction to the horrors of climate change.  It was notable that when it came to the specifics, almost the majority of those polled were against the particular percentage on car fuel prices about which they were asked.</P>
        <P>People want to do something about the environment, use public transport and do what is right.  However, they also want fairness.  It is not fair for the Government to be talking about slapping on carbon taxes for the use of cars when it has not, in the past ten years that it has been in office, provided public transport options.  The reality is that if carbon taxes were introduced in the manner that seems to be anticipated by the Minister, they would almost certainly not be fair.  In particular, they would impact on families and on people who are poor and living in isolated communities who do have access to good public transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ChrisAndrews"><NameTxt>Deputy Chris Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, with the permission of the House. </P>
        <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this particular issue.  Living in south Dublin and representing Dublin South East, it is obviously a problem that I see and face every day.  Sometimes when people talk to public representatives such as Deputies and councillors, they believe they are detached from the problems of traffic and everyday life, but that certainly is not true.  There is a sense that because we have the Luas, the DART and an increasing number of QBCs, people believe everything is rosy in Dublin 4, 6 and 8, when this is not true at all.  Very many communities are located in those areas, Terenure, Rathgar, Crumlin, Dundrum and Rathfarnham, for instance.  Every morning in the greater Dublin area, in which not everyone has access to public transport, private cars descend on residential and small communities and depart through them in the evening.  In time the DTA will change that, but in the meantime in Dublin South East residents and visitors have a problem because many of the villages such as Ranelagh, Terenure and Rathmines are regarded by the planners and experts in Dublin City Council as obstacles to the delivery of traffic management systems.  They regard these communities as difficulties which have to be overcome &mdash; and then they drive through and create arteries through these small village communities.</P><Col N="274"/>
        <P>There is a great sense of village and community life in Dublin South East, but most people are commuting through it, with ramifications for the quality of life of residents and families.  In particular, Rathgar and Terenure have literally had a wall built between them, which has divided communities and had a major impact on residents.  The RPA has just carried out a feasibility study to extend the Luas from Christchurch through Terenure and into Rathfarnham, but I am not sure how much further that process will go, given that this is not a natural route in the way the line to Sandyford is &mdash; it was traditionally a rail route.  The line through Terenure would mean the displacement of traffic from the main artery into the residential side streets, the compulsory purchase of people&rsquo;s gardens etc.  It would also mean the Luas, for all its advantages, running through settled residential areas and small streets such as Brighton Street and Brighton Square, with major repercussions for residents.  While this has been examined I am not sure how successful it will be, as it would mean the existing QBCs, in effect, will have to be closed down.  Instead of complementing the QBCs, the Luas would, in fact, be replacing and substituting them.  I am not convinced that is the objective when we are looking at public transport options.</P>
        <P>The infrastructure that Transport 21 will deliver has an enormous impact.  When a road race was organised through the Dublin Port tunnel shortly after it opened &mdash; or perhaps just before &mdash; I thought people would be wading through water because of the headlines about it over the years to the effect that it was flooding, leaking and so on.  There were major objections to it, but it is a great success from the perspective of residents in the inner city and people visiting Dublin.  It has had an enormous impact on people&rsquo;s lives and reduced the number of heavy goods vehicles significantly, which has had a major impact on schools.  The children attending City Quay school are much safer going there in the mornings.  It is healthier for them, their parents and older people; the port tunnel has made a real difference to the lives of ordinary people and the city of Dublin.</P>
        <P>The need for a DTA is very clear, and makes sense.  People will find ways of objecting to it, of course, and that is inevitable since they object to everything that comes through the Oireachtas while, at the same time, wondering why things do not happen sooner and more quickly.  The DTA will deliver faster and more reliable public transport.  Reliability and the ability of public transport to arrive on time and deliver people to their destinations on time is the key.  Luas has made an enormous difference and the reason it is so popular is that it is reliable, clean and efficient.  When one leaves home in the morning, one knows one will get to work or to one&rsquo;s destination within 20 minutes or half an hour from the time one arrives on the platform.  While the authority will be powerful, the Minister and elected representatives will be more powerful and will have a direct say in how the authority delivers public transport infrastructure.</P>
        <P>When the directly elected lord mayor is in place, there may be a turf war between him or her, the authority, the Minister and the councillors.  If the lord mayor is from a different political party from the Minister, it could lead to interesting times ahead for us all.  Members of the D&aacute;il should keep this under review when the procedure for reforming local government is being framed.</P>
        <P>I was concerned initially that the Dublin transport authority would be another large organisation, such as the HSE, into which Members would have very little input.  This is not the case because I have seen what the Minister has done.  The Minister stated the Government will retain responsibility for setting overall transport policy and determining the broad direction of transport investment policy, as already laid down in Transport 21.  The Minister will approve the authority&rsquo;s transport strategy and will be able to give mandatory policy directions with which the authority will be required to comply.  This power is crucial and can be used to ensure <Col N="275"/>the authority acts in accordance with Government policy.  The authority&rsquo;s chairperson and chief executive will be required to appear before Oireachtas committees, including the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is very important.  It is good that elected representatives, including the Minister, will be able to determine how the authority manages its policy direction.  The legislation allows councillors to sit on the board of the authority.  Those at the coalface of interaction with residents in the city will have an input, which is very important.</P>
        <P>Chapter 4 obliges the authority to implement appropriate demand management strategies.  This is a reference to the congestion charge.   The Minister stated recently: &ldquo;While the introduction of congestion charging in the GDA is not provided for at this stage, the authority will be required to keep the position generally under review and may make recommendations to the Minister if it considers that additional demand management measures are required.&rdquo;  I welcome this.  In principle, I have no difficulty with a congestion charge but the devil is in the detail.  The required transport infrastructure is not in place and it would, therefore, be very premature to consider a congestion charge for Dublin.  I have no doubt one will be introduced eventually but it is not yet on the cards.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s message in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Dublin transport authority will streamline the decision-making process and will deliver the required infrastructure in the greater Dublin area.  It will also strengthen the interaction between land use, planning and transport.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute and I thank Deputy Chris Andrews for sharing time with me.  The debate on the setting up of the Dublin transport authority for the greater Dublin area is very important.  As a representative of a constituency in the greater Dublin area, it is an important development in ensuring we have a co-ordinated approach to transport issues.</P>
        <P>Since my election last May, I have worked with many of the relevant stakeholders in trying to improve the level of service of our public transport service providers.  Dublin transport issues cannot be addressed by considering Dublin alone.  Solving the problems can only be achieved in conjunction with counties surrounding Dublin, namely, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, which are the home to many commuters to the city.</P>
        <P>The proposed establishment of the new authority, which was the preferred option following consultation by the Department of Transport, will see the putting in place of a single authority to oversee and set the strategic direction for the provision of transport infrastructure and services in the greater Dublin area.  Currently, there are approximately 16 bodies with some responsibility for transport in the greater Dublin area.  These include the relevant Departments, principally the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; CIE and its three operating subsidiaries, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann; the Railway Procurement Agency; the National Roads Authority; the Dublin Transportation Office; and the seven local authorities in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Under Transport 21, an investment of &euro;14 billion is being made in the greater Dublin area.  The main elements of this investment are significant investment in rail infrastructure, including the metro and the Maynooth and Kildare lines, and the construction of the suburban interurban rail interconnector that will provide a tunnelled link between Heuston Station and the Docklands via St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, and a link to the northern line.  It also provides for a bus network to create a meshed network of services, rerouted to take account of the rail developments.  The development of park and ride facilities and the completion of the upgrade of the M50 are also included.</P>
        <P>The creation of the authority will ensure co-ordinated and integrated delivery of the Transport 21 investment programme in the greater Dublin area.  It will utilise key skilled personnel <Col N="276"/>to maximum benefit across a number of projects and rationalise the existing institutional arrangements while maintaining a strong strategic dimension.  The authority will have a clear mandate to transform the transport system in the capital and will have unambiguous statutory authority to implement that mandate.  It will set out the strategic framework for the delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the greater Dublin area in light of a strategic transport plan covering a period of 12 to 20 years.  It will also prepare a six-year implementation plan translating strategy into action.</P>
        <P>The authority will engage closely in each stage of the planning process, from the consideration of the regional planning guidelines to the consideration of city and county development plans and local area plans, in order to ensure the greatest degree of consistency possible between its transport strategy and the land-use planning process.  The authority&rsquo;s transport strategy will have to be consistent with the regional planning guidelines in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have the power to ensure consistency between land use and transport policies.  I welcome this aspect of the authority&rsquo;s work in particular because there has not been a co-ordinated approach in the past.  We have allowed the building of houses without providing adequate park and ride facilities.  Maynooth and Confey rail stations are two cases in point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A co-ordinated approach will bring focus to the planning of transport.  The authority will assist in ensuring the transport infrastructure and services planned for the greater Dublin area are delivered on time and within budget and in a fully co-ordinated manner that minimises disruption to the social and economic life of the region.  This planned investment in the greater Dublin area represents a particular challenge, given the scale of the projects proposed and the need to ensure integration in their planning, delivery and operation to maximise the benefit of the investment.</P>
        <P>The absence of the authority did not mean that no development of the public transport system has taken place to date.  However, its continued absence would give rise to a real danger that the investment envisaged under Transport 21 would not be delivered in a timely, cost-effective and co-ordinated manner.  I believe the benefits of establishing the new authority will greatly outweigh its costs.  While the authority will require significant resources to discharge its range of functions, a significant proportion of the human resources required will come from the existing agencies.  There also will be cost savings associated with better co-ordination and integration of project and service delivery, as well as more rigorous powers of oversight in respect of the delivery of the projects.</P>
        <P>The National Competitiveness Council has noted that the level of infrastructure in a country affects competitiveness and performance in a number of ways.  Inadequate infrastructure can increase traffic congestion, reduce productivity and increase costs.  This affects both existing firms and a country&rsquo;s attractiveness as an investment location and in respect of its general quality of life.  Ireland ranks poorly with regard to perception of the quality of its transport infrastructure.  The proposed establishment of a single authority in the greater Dublin area to set the strategic direction for transport infrastructure and services and to ensure its implementation will contribute positively to national competitiveness.  By delivering an integrated public transport network, there also should be a positive impact for the socially excluded and vulnerable groups who tend to have a heavier reliance on public transport to access employment opportunities, social and health services and leisure activities.</P>
        <P>The timely delivery of the public transport infrastructure and services will provide an attractive alternative to private car users, particularly commuters, and will result in a modal shift to <Col N="277"/>more sustainable transport modes.  Linking land use and transport planning and implementation will enable the authority, together with the regional authorities in the greater Dublin area, to establish more sustainable residential and commercial developments in the greater Dublin area.  The traffic management and demand management functions of the new authority also will allow it to improve the efficiency of the transport network.  This will have a positive impact on the reduction in growth of the levels of greenhouse gas emissions from transport.  The authority has been established after a thorough consultation process and I welcome its establishment.  Moreover, I look forward to the benefits it will bring.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>First, like most Members, I welcome this Bill although everyone has reservations, myself included, about the Dublin transport authority.  I am the Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and during the past 12 months its members, including Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady and others, listened to all the stakeholders.  There are as many views on how the future development of Dublin traffic should be handled as there are days in the year.  Everyone has a different view and a co-ordinated approach is required.  If Dublin&rsquo;s traffic management is to be successful in future, it must be implemented via the Dublin transport authority &mdash; I will revert to this point shortly.  While it could prove to be a poisoned chalice in the future, at least it constitutes a genuine effort to bring together under a single umbrella all the stakeholders, each of which sincerely believes itself to have the only show in town.  That is the great problem associated with competing demands and the existing competition.</P>
        <P>There is no harm in painting a picture that demonstrates the importance of this issue and the extent and depth to which the Dublin transport authority must deliver in the years ahead.  The last census of population revealed that the population within the functional area that will be given to this authority, if one includes the counties of Kildare, Wicklow and Meath with the greater Dublin area, is 1.5 million people.  Moreover, this population is increasing yearly.  Catering for such an increase is in itself a daunting task because problems will arise wherever one places such a density of human beings, irrespective of whether it is in the field of education or transport.  In addition, statistical projections suggest that in 20 years&rsquo; time, there will be exactly twice as many cars registered to people in Ireland than is the case at present.  In other words, unless something is done, there will be double the number of cars getting in one&rsquo;s way along the quays in 20 years&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>Speaking from the perspective of an Opposition Member &mdash; I often made this point &mdash; some of the measures taken regarding Dublin transport in the past five or ten years have been highly positive.  The Luas has been outstanding and the port tunnel is fine traffic infrastructure.  The problem, however, is that because of the figures I have just outlined, one is obliged to run to standstill as an ever-increasing number of cars are descending on the city.  One does not need to be Einstein to know this.</P>
        <P>While I am not a native of this city, it is the nation&rsquo;s capital and I have been using it for the past 30 years.  I can never understand a few fundamental matters, some of which are minor.  For instance, I fail to understand the reason that a breakdown of a lorry in the morning between the city centre and Heuston Station has the capacity to hold up traffic for up to an hour and a half.  I cannot understand why it is not simply moved out of the way and got rid of.  That is the peak period during which people try to get to work and such breakdowns give rise to all sorts of commotion.  That only is a very minor matter.  Moreover, Members will have noticed that the manner in which Dublin&rsquo;s traffic is controlled during the eight weeks or so before Christmas makes it run somewhat better.  Given the huge problems that exist in the city, I fail to understand the reason such a regime cannot be run every day of the year while all the basic infrastruc<Col N="278"/>ture projects under Transport 21 are being dreamed up and, one hopes, eventually implemented.</P>
        <P>One fundamental matter can be discerned by anyone who has eyes in his or her head, namely, no matter what happens in future, the quays and all the other arterial routes into the city centre will never become wider.  Consequently, there is absolute competition per square foot on every single inch of ground in the city centre.  There is competition for it every day of the week between buses, cars, lorries, pedestrians and so on.  Either Members as legislators or the Dublin transport authority must decide who will be given priority in that competition.  Colleagues on all sides have been talking about congestion charges and similar initiatives, and I am certain that if one waits long enough, something like this will happen.  Certainly, as was mentioned previously, no matter how wide the M50, the N6 from Galway or the other arterial roads into Dublin become, they will be filled from 7. 30 a.m. until 9.30 a.m. every morning.  It is like water pouring into a bottle.</P>
        <P>The point at issue is what one should do with the traffic when it reaches a certain point.  I always have believed &mdash; this has been discussed at length at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport &mdash; that an interception system must be put in place.  In other words, the traffic coming off the arterial routes must be intercepted.  I do not know how far from Dublin one should do this as I am not an expert in this regard.  I refer to a mechanism such as park and ride systems.  This problem is not confined to Dublin as it also exists in Cork, Galway and elsewhere, albeit to a much lesser degree.  The members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, together with its Chairman, Deputy Frank Fahey, visited a park and ride facility in Essex, England, two months ago. The town it was in was not nearly as big as Dublin so the idea might be more appropriate to Cork or Galway but I could see elements that would work well in Dublin.</P>
        <P>There is psychology involved in people&rsquo;s relationships with their cars.  People feel safe and independent in the bubble that is the car; it is their domain where no one can interfere with them and nobody can tell them what to do.  One need not talk to anyone in one&rsquo;s car.  Due to the fact that the car takes people from home to work, asking them to use it less is a huge psychological job.  There is no new science behind this theory.  There are 1,000 car parking spaces at the park and ride facility in Essex and those involved have found that people approaching the facility feel it will take around ten minutes to park the car and walk to where the bus should be.  The operators told us that if a bus is waiting as one approaches the park and ride facility, one is more likely to avail of it because one has more confidence in the service.  That is reasonable human nature.  However, the next piece of psychology applies to the bus itself.  It may be waiting for customers but there is no point taking it if it will hit a snarl up of traffic half a mile from where one works.</P>
        <P>We return to the competition for space I mentioned.  If competition for space is part of the system, quality bus corridors must be given priority.  No matter what a traffic light shows, the sensor on a bus should ensure it and its 60 to 80 occupants fly through.  In this way priority is given to people who leave their cars at park and ride facilities and poor motorists will be left to watch the bus fly by.  Problems exist in this system, however, because one must ensure that once the bus enters the city it can bring people to their places of work.  There is no point in bringing a person within a mile of his or her workplace on a cold, frosty morning and then leaving him or her to use shank&rsquo;s mare for the rest of the journey.  People will not do this.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that there will eventually be a congestion charge in this city.  However, it will not come into being until people are given alternatives and places they can safely park their cars.  People must see that it is in their best interests to do this.  There will be 1,000 good reasons for doing this in the years to come because the price of oil reached $130 per barrel <Col N="279"/>today.  Economists have told me that in two or three years it will reach $200 per barrel.  The price has doubled in the past 12 months so how would one dispute this forecast?  Given issues such as energy conservation, carbon footprints and other matters I do not have time to go into, if ever there was an opportune time to do something like this, although it should have been done before, this is it.</P>
        <P>I think the Luas is a great system for those lucky enough to live on the route, but it is important that it be connected.  We all hope 30 million people will use Dublin Airport in five years&rsquo; time but one can imagine the problems that will ensue if the metro, or a different system, does not service the facility.  There will be gridlock from the city centre to Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>I believe there will be an integrated approach to transport.  We have not brought about integrated ticketing and this has been a huge bugbear for me for years.  I have used Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for many years to travel from Ballinasloe to Dublin and the service is beginning to improve but sometimes, at the weekend, it is horrendous.  It is a good service on ordinary working days.  When I buy a three or four day return ticket at Ballinasloe or Athlone, why can the price of the bus from Heuston Station to here not be included?  This should be simple.  The strange thing is, this is available to those who come to Dublin on a day return ticket from Ballinasloe or Athlone but not those who come on a three, four or 30 day return ticket.  This is a long way from integrated ticketing.  My understanding of integrated ticketing is that whatever mode of public transport one uses, one ticket will take one to one&rsquo;s destination.  We are a million miles from such a scenario.  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Noel Ahern, may not agree with that but, either way, integrated ticketing is not available and we seem to be a long way from achieving it.</P>
        <P>I have some problems with the Dublin transport authority and most of them have been well aired in the past few hours, but I want to add my tuppence worth.  I am sick to the teeth of the mechanism of accountability to the D&aacute;il that exists for the HSE and other organisations.  This is not an original thought and my colleagues have spoken of it for months and years.  Why are we going to create a similar animal in the DTA?  I can see myself in a couple of years making representations on behalf of constituents of mine in east Galway who have difficulties with public transport in Dublin and cannot access a hospital.  I will put down a parliamentary question to the Minister for Transport on the matter because I am elected, like everyone else here, to do a particular job for my constituents.  This is a democratic Parliament that is accountable to the people.  Under Transport 21, we have been told some &euro;14 billion will be provided for Dublin&rsquo;s transport system over the coming years and there will be a great deal of taxpayers&rsquo; money involved.  When I put down my parliamentary question for the Minister for Transport in a few years I guarantee he or she, or the Ceann Comhairle, will write back to me and state the D&aacute;il has no responsibility for the matter.  Speaking as someone who has been here for some time, that is a bad day&rsquo;s work.  We will be on the slippery slope.</P>
        <P>Some ten, 12 or 15 years ago it was the in thing to take responsibility away from politicians and whoever was in Government, but the HSE has shown this is a bad policy for everyone.  The creation of this authority, as it stands, will also be bad policy because if a project is to stand up, it should stand up in this House.  Let the new director general of the Dublin transport authority sit in this House where the civil servants sit today.  We should allow that facility somehow.  If there are important administrative and future policy matters to discuss, other Deputies and I should be able to ask the Minister for Transport questions as he will have ultimate responsibility.  It has been suggested that the authority will be connected to the Oireachtas through various committees, including the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; the authority could not sidestep the Committee of Public Accounts no matter how it tried.  It holds every other State organisation to account.  Obviously the Comptroller and Auditor General would have a say in what happens there anyway.  It is no big deal in this particular Bill.</P><Col N="280"/>
      
        <P>I notice, if my briefing note is correct, that the DTA will be answerable with regard to the Freedom of Information Act.  The note then goes on to say that the authority itself will decide, in its wisdom, which information will be released.  I do not like this and I smell a rat.  All of a sudden there will be a raft of confidential information that this House and ordinary members of the public will not be able to access.  It is against this background that I genuinely believe that no matter what the authority does it should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister mentioned that, initially at least, the Railway Procurement Agency will not be under the umbrella of this transport authority.  I cannot understand this.  In the future there will be competition for space between road and rail, as I mentioned earlier.  With regard to the proposal contained in Transport 21, the ability to carry substantial numbers of people by rail from Heuston Station to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green in the centre of the city is of major importance.  The Acting Chairman knows of the countless thousands of people who converge on this city every day at Heuston Station.  If we cannot get these people to the city centre efficiently, it will become a major problem.  The only way we can do this is to continue the railway line either underground or above ground.</P>
        <P>A great deal of debate has centred around the input of Dublin Bus to the &ldquo;big dig&rdquo; that is to start in the near future.  I can imagine the traffic problems that will occur when the big dig starts, as we already have major problems even before it starts.  As a number of my colleagues mentioned earlier, I can only hope that when the Dublin transport authority is up and running, situations in which the same street is dug up four or five times in a year will occur less often.  There is no point in saying I hope it will never happen again, as I am sure it will, but it might happen less often.  Given the various agencies that will work under the umbrella of the Dublin transport authority, I sincerely hope this tendency will be overcome to some degree.  Problems such as these raise the blood pressure of motorists every morning and evening.  The smallest hole is dug for what I have no doubt are very good reasons, to allow utility providers access, for example, but, gallingly, the same hole is opened the following month and again thereafter.  Why do we not have a more integrated approach?  I assume that with the introduction of the Bill this will be less likely to happen.</P>
        <P>I hope that for the sake of everyone in Ireland, not just those in Dublin, we will see a better approach to the provision of a more efficient traffic system for Dublin.  The idea of extending the authority&rsquo;s remit to counties outside Dublin is of major importance.  Not long ago we met with the county managers of the counties concerned.  They are doing a good job on their own but I got the distinct impression that one of them did not know what the other was doing.  In my own county and city of Galway a few years ago, I certainly found that neither Galway City Council nor Galway County Council knew what the other was doing from a traffic management point of view, although they were both within a single county.  This has been the major deficiency in Dublin transport over the years.  I hope the Dublin transport authority will have the necessary clout to stop the faction fighting and the moral authority to ensure that actions are taken in a co-ordinated way.  I can only hope for everyone&rsquo;s sake that it is successful.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Deputy M. J. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is long overdue.  Anyone who does business in Dublin city will be well aware of its major problems with traffic congestion, particularly over the past ten years.  Much of this has resulted from the economic success of the country.  In addition, with the migration of workers and other individuals and <Col N="281"/>families from west to east, the population of the east coast has increased significantly over the past ten years and the number of people working on the east coast, particularly in Dublin, has increased by up to 250,000 since 1999.  This has clearly brought problems in terms of infrastructure development in our capital city.</P>
        <P>The Bill is important in that it gives the Dublin transport authority jurisdiction not only over Dublin city centre and the three local authorities in the county, but also over areas such as Meath, Kildare and parts of Wicklow.  It is important that the Bill make provision for the control of the authority to be extended if required in the future.  In Carlow, 6,000 people leave the town every day, the vast majority of them to work in Dublin.  Many of these people travel by car, which adds to congestion in the city.</P>
        <P>Successive Governments over a number of years have invested significantly in improving the road structure as well as rail links and bus services.  We as a people have become far too car-dependent.  We must change our mindset to move away from cars and towards public transport.  Regrettably, over the past number of years we have not had a first-class public transport system on which we could all depend and thus many of us, including myself, were obliged to use our cars more than our European neighbours.  However, over the past six years in particular the rail service has improved significantly, as has the bus service.  This improvement must continue.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport outlined an ambitious plan four years ago in Transport 21.  If all aspects of this plan are implemented, using moneys ring-fenced for this purpose, we will see a major improvement in our transport infrastructure over the next number of years.  The number of cars on our roads has doubled in the past eight years and the city is choking with traffic congestion.  The only way we can change people&rsquo;s mindset is to give them confidence in a public transport system that works well and on which they can depend.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have improved their work rates in that they manage road construction and repairs in a more efficient manner.  There is greater co-operation between local authorities when two or more are involved in the same road works.  It is welcome that they identify a lead authority and leave the running of the project to it.  The Garda, by separating the functions of a specially designated traffic corps, has played its part in the improvements.  I hope those improvements are ongoing.</P>
        <P>This debate is timely because of the current crisis in oil production, including today&rsquo;s record price for a barrel of crude oil.  The crisis will affect how everyone uses cars and oil, on which we are dependent.  If the price continues to increase during the coming months, there will need to be a more radical examination of our car transportation and national cost base policies, given our dependence on exports.  Take the example set by Manhattan in the city of New York.  Fewer than 10% of Manhattan&rsquo;s residents own cars.  The majority always use public transport or taxis.  No business person in London uses his or her own car &mdash; business people use the subway because London has a good transport system.  When Sydney built its Olympic stadium for the 2000 Olympic Games, it used that time of major investment to improve its public transport services and has consequently benefited.  It is important to learn from the experiences of other countries.</P>
        <P>While the draft legislation is focused on Dublin, it could be used as a template in other cities or towns experiencing growth and, therefore, traffic congestion.  The Bill should experience an easy passage through the House because it will establish the DTA as the public authority charged with overall responsibility for surface transport in the Dublin area.  If we are to succeed in establishing the authority in the short term, we should not spend too long in the consultation period.  We are snowed under by reports on transport in Dublin city.</P><Col N="282"/>
        <P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of integrated ticketing.  I do not understand why, in today&rsquo;s age of computers and programmers, one cannot buy a ticket in Carlow or Kilkenny that can be used on bus, train and Luas services.  The situation beggars belief.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State success with the Bill, which I hope is passed by the House speedily.  The sooner the authority is put on stream, the better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking as someone who has stepped outside his car and used trains since being elected to the House.  This city has serious traffic problems.  I am fortunate that my area has the DART service.  People will use public transport if it is efficient and frequent.  Bringing all of the agencies together under a single authority must allow them to work together on behalf of the public.  Deputy Connaughton was correct in his reference to the significant population growth in counties Louth, Meath, Kildare, Dublin and Wicklow on the east coast.  The number of cars on the road cannot continue to increase at the current rate.  Work on the M50 is ongoing and has made a difference to the parts of the road I have been on.  However, if one builds extra roads, cars will fill them.  We must consider managing change in the public transport sector.</P>
        <P>For the first 15 minutes of Deputy Connaughton&rsquo;s contribution he backed the Bill wholeheartedly, but he was more ambiguous during the last five minutes.  He raised a concern discussed in our policy groups and at committees, namely, that we should not create an authority that operates at arm&rsquo;s length from the Department.  It must be answerable to the Houses and the Minister for Transport and, from reading the Bill&rsquo;s details, I am satisfied that this will be the case.  Members have often stated that certain agencies are not directly accountable to the House or do not take our opinions and those of our constituents into account.  The DTA will be a positive step, as it is clear that the Minister will have overall responsibility and a mandate to direct the DTA in what it must do on a day-to-day basis.  The position of the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, was mentioned.  The RPA will function as a separate entity under the DTA&rsquo;s remit and its procurement business will continue.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on important legislation crucial to the delivery of many aspects of Transport 21, which will further improve the transport network in the greater Dublin area.  The passing of the Bill will see through a commitment in the programme for Government to ensure the prompt and efficient delivery of Transport 21 and other improvements to the capital&rsquo;s transportation systems.  The delivery of Transport 21 must be co-ordinated by a central agency such as the DTA that reports and is answerable to the Minister for Transport.</P>
        <P>In my constituency of Dublin North, Transport 21 will bring about a world class public transport infrastructure in the next five to six years.  Metro north, which will run from St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green through the city to Dublin Airport, Swords and beyond towards Donabate, will improve the access for people in my constituency to the city centre and beyond.  In this regard, the DTA will be important for my constituency.  Transport 21 and metro north will provide a necessary rail link to the airport.  It has been projected that, during the next five to six years, 30 million passengers will pass through the airport.  Currently, 95% of all passengers through Dublin Airport access it by private car.  This situation must change because the area&rsquo;s road network is being clogged.</P>
        <P>The previous Government under former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, gave a firm commitment to deliver a high-speed metro connection to north County Dublin, including the major town of Swords.  This transport plan was fully supported financially by the then Minister for Finance, the new Taoiseach.  Metro north will have the annual capacity to carry millions of passengers into Dublin city centre and St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green in less than 25 minutes and will link with the Luas and mainline train networks through the interconnector at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.</P><Col N="283"/>
        <P>It is many Deputies&rsquo; opinion that Transport 21 is the single most ambitious and forward-thinking project undertaken by any European country in the past 50 years.  The new transport network will improve the lives of thousands of constituents in Dublin North, Dublin city and the greater Dublin area, in particular by the delivery of metro west in west County Dublin.  The Government gave this commitment to the people before the election when many Members of the Opposition stated that the Government would not deliver on Transport 21.  This legislation advances that commitment a step further.  Many of those who criticised Transport 21 were the same people who said, ten years ago, that the Luas system would either not be built or would not be operationally effective.  Some 25 million Luas journeys are now made every year.  The efficient and effective Luas service will be further improved under Transport 21 by linking both lines in the city centre.  The success of the Luas is proof that when an efficient, effective and dependable public transport service is provided, people will leave their cars behind.</P>
        <P>Other planned improvements under Transport 21 include the extension of the DART network to Balbriggan, serving Donabate, Rush, Lusk and Skerries.  This enhanced rail service is vital to meet the needs of this growing area.  The increase in the capacity of the northern rail line to four tracks will further increase the capacity and frequency of trains.  While the Railway Procurement Agency will retain responsibility for the delivery of these projects and will remain a separate agency, the Dublin transport authority will work closely with it to ensure that both surface transport and rail-based transport are planned and delivered efficiently.  In all cases, the Minister for Transport will retain overall responsibility and the Dublin transport authority will be directly answerable to him or her.</P>
        <P>The Fingal area of Dublin will be transformed by the delivery of Transport 21.  With the airport in Swords, the M1 motorway, the northern rail line and the upgraded M50, we are at the economic and development heart of the State.  This has ensured full employment in my constituency.  During the general election campaign, I gave a firm commitment to my constituents that I would do my best to ensure that the great improvements outlined in Transport 21 are delivered.  I am confident that the establishment of the Dublin transport authority, working in conjunction with the Department of Transport, will ensure a speedy delivery of these commitments.</P>
        <P>Last year saw the delivery of the first 100 additional buses for the Dublin area, as promised under Transport 21.  We must continue to improve the bus network and to ensure it works in tandem with other transport agencies.  The Dublin transport authority will be able to bring this about in an effective and cohesive manner.<b>  </b>There must be further utilisation of the Dublin Port tunnel, which has proved extremely successful.  Some bus routes are using the tunnel, which provides speedier access to the city centre from the Swords and Kinsealy areas.  These types of services should be further expanded.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to several anomalies that have arisen in the Swords and Lucan areas where particular Dublin Bus services have been excluded from using the port tunnel because of competition considerations arising from the Road Transport Act 1932.  I ask the Minister of State to consider whether the Dublin Transport Authority Bill can be used to amend the 1932 Act to make it more relevant to a modern public transport system.  The current difficulties with the 41X bus route in Swords have arisen as a consequence of that legislation.  There is no reason that this service should be prevented from continuing to use the port tunnel.  I intend to table amendments to the Bill to deal with this anomaly.  In the meantime, I ask the Minister to look favourably on the revised application by Dublin Bus in respect of the 41X service so that it can once again use the port tunnel to access the city centre.  The Department should grant the revised licence without further delay.</P><Col N="284"/>
        <P>I compliment the local authority in my area, Fingal County Council, on the work done in recent years by the county manager, Mr. David O&rsquo;Connor, and the director of services for transportation, Mr. Mick Lorrigan, to secure improvements for my constituents as part of Transport 21.  I am pleased that the Bill provides that the Dublin transport authority will work closely with local authorities, whose members have vast local experience and are eager to assist.  The Dublin transport authority will have a crucially important role in the delivery of the Dublin aspects of Transport 21.  While I welcome its establishment, I intend to monitor its work closely to ensure that a cohesive and integrated public transport system is developed in the next five to ten years in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitments.</P>
        <P>Much of that work is already under way.  The second terminal at Dublin Airport will soon be constructed.  The upgrading of the M50 motorway is well under way and improvements can already be seen.  There are hundreds of additional buses on our streets and new rail carriages are in use.  The port tunnel is an important infrastructural element in the city&rsquo;s transport system.  Further improvements will be seen in the coming months, such as the commitment given to me by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that all mainline trains on the northern line serving the city centre at peak times will, by the end of the year, have eight carriages and that the same will apply to all DART trains by the end of September.  While we await the establishment of the Dublin transport authority, there are many steps that can be taken now to improve the daily lives of commuters.</P>
        <P>Another important aspect of the Dublin transport authority&rsquo;s responsibilities will be to ensure that county development plans take full consideration of public transport needs in all new developments.  The authority will have a formal role in the drawing up of county development plans.  Many local authorities, including Fingal County Council, have shown themselves to be progressive in this regard, but it is important that the Dublin transport authority has a formal role.  Public transport services are improving in general but there are many areas in which further improvement is required and many actions that can be taken relatively speedily, such as the delivery of park and ride facilities for buses pending the introduction of the metro.  The public must be put first in all our considerations.  We must cut through the red tape and introduce amendments to archaic legislation that is not serving the public good.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill that the Minister for Transport will retain overall responsibility for setting transport policy in the Dublin area and determining the direction of transport policy investment in line with Transport 21.  The Minister will have responsibility to approve the Dublin transport authority&rsquo;s transport strategy and will be able to give it mandatory policy directions with which it must comply.  The authority will be accountable to the D&aacute;il and the Minister for Transport.  I look forward to its establishment and to the continued implementation of Transport 21 in line with Government commitments.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Government on finally bringing forward this Bill.  I was a Member of this House when my former, sadly deceased, colleague, Jim Mitchell, brought forward legislation in 1986 to set up a Dublin transport authority to resolve the problem of the fragmentation of transport services in Dublin.  Unfortunately, that legislation was scrapped by Fianna F&aacute;il in 1987.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government is now bringing forward legislation that could have been enacted more than 20 years ago.</P>
        <P>In the context of transport policy, this could best be described as a Bill for slow learners given the length of time it has taken to acknowledge the requirements in this area.  The tragedy of the scrapping of the legislation in 1987 is that many of the problems with the transport system in Dublin might never have occurred if there had been one overarching body in charge <Col N="285"/>of transport and road policy, which could have ensured a coherent and co-ordinated   development of public transport systems and an integration of the services provided by those systems.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>Unfortunately, as other speakers observed, we still lack an integrated ticketing system and this Bill does nothing to rectify that.  Millions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money have been wasted in recent years in paying consultants to look into what is apparently the mystical possibility of providing integrated ticketing for our public transport services.  We seem incapable of achieving something that is in operation in other EU member states and elsewhere.  We may ultimately need a consultant to investigate the consultants to ascertain the reason for this wastage of millions of euro in public funding.</P>
        <P>This Bill is generally positive in its intent.  However, as other Members argued, none of us wants to see another quango with devolved ministerial powers that is unaccountable to this House. Following the enactment of this legislation and the establishment of the Dublin transport authority on a statutory footing, it will no longer be possible to receive replies to questions asked in this House about our transport system, including rail and Luas.  There is no real accountability in this Bill.  The authority will perhaps be called before an Oireachtas committee once or twice per year but we cannot be certain about transparency.</P>
        <P>Having been out of the D&aacute;il from 2002 to 2007, I find it extraordinary that the health service is no longer accountable to this House in a meaningful way.  Parliamentary questions are transferred to the HSE, which sends a letter three or four months later containing a response written in the Civil Service jargon formerly used in the initial ministerial replies that were expanded upon after supplementary inquiries.  Given that billions of euro will be spent on transport, it is not acceptable in a democracy that a body such as this is established without a direct mechanism for accountability to this House.  There is no reason we cannot establish a communications network with this authority that functions better than the one which exists between the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  That would facilitate a Minister retaining political responsibility, thereby making the authority answerable to this House.  This fundamental flaw in the legislation must be addressed because it will otherwise add to the democratic deficit that exists.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that Ministers want to escape accountability when things go wrong, but it is a sign of a tired Government that it seeks to undermine Parliament&rsquo;s responsibilities and its own accountability with the constant creation of bodies with powers diverted from Departments to the point where they cease to have meaningful accountability to either House.  This practice is bringing democracy into disrepute and undermining the Constitution.  Government is being transferred to agencies which do not have an electoral mandate and Ministers are sealing themselves off from liability.  When things go wrong, they can join in the complaints made in this House and escape accountability.</P>
        <P>I want to speak about some of the problems that have arisen in the transport system.  We have not brought the way we operate up to date by any stretch of the imagination.  I am intimately familiar with the M50 as it serves my constituency.  If a crash occurs on that road, traffic gridlock ensues for miles.  Blissfully unaware of the gridlock, people continue to enter the motorway only to find themselves on a stationary parkway for several hours.  When I drive from Dundrum to Dublin Airport in the middle of the day, I no longer rely on the M50 even though it is the best route in theory.  If an accident occurred, I would find myself stuck in the middle of the road and unable to leave it.  Even if I came along 30 minutes after the accident, I would receive no forewarning.  All our motorways and principal roads should have computerised electronic signage at main entrance points to warn people about problems and blockages and suggest alternative routes.  A computerised central office for Dublin&rsquo;s roads should <Col N="286"/>provide this service.  We are no longer in the 1940s and it is not rocket science to provide such a service.  Countries which are less wealthy than Ireland can provide electronic information.  Does a thought process exist which could develop such a service and who will take responsibility for it?  Will we have to await the establishment of this authority before anyone even considers the possibility and will the authority have to co-ordinate all Dublin&rsquo;s local authorities to run the service?  I do not understand why signage is not yet in place given that it would save time and money, as well as reduce frustration and gridlock on our roads.</P>
<?oasys _cl14- ?>
        <P>In regard to rail, Luas and metro, I was amused to read reports in <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> about the Green Party&rsquo;s transport policy launch, as if that party is semi-detached from Government.  Deputy Cuffe waxed lyrical at the launch.  The <i>Irish Independent </i>reported: &ldquo;In a submission to the Dublin Transportation Office&rsquo;s 20-year transport strategy for the capital, the party also says that public transport projects, including Luas extensions, metro north and metro west should be pushed forward and delivered ahead of schedule.&rdquo;  According to the Green Party, we should all be on our bicycles.  The elderly and the disabled should be cycling into the city centre, irrespective of the weather or, in the context of city centre gridlock and the absence of cycling lanes, the number of people who would die under buses and cars if the cycling population increased.  We should get real.  The Green Party is in government and my constituency of Dublin South has a Green Party Deputy.</P>
        <P>In the run-up to last year&rsquo;s election, Fianna F&aacute;il promised the people of Rathfarnham, Knocklyon and Ballyboden that they would get a Luas line.  That was not set out in Transport 21 but in the pre-election excitement a feasibility study was commissioned on a line to the area.  A stroke was pulled and it was pretended to the people of Knocklyon and Rathfarnham that the Luas was on its way, even though no funding was allocated in the transport plan to turn a single sod on the project before 2015.  The Green Party ran around Knocklyon with leaflets promising a Luas line and, even more nauseating, it held a press conference this week in which it called for one to be provided.</P>
        <P>The feasibility study published by the Railway Procurement Agency presents a Luas line which runs from Dundrum, through Churchtown, Rathfarnham, Terenure and Harold&rsquo;s Cross to Christchurch.  The route skims the edge of Rathfarnham but goes nowhere near Ballyboden or Ballyroan.  It fails to approach Knocklyon and Ballycullen, which have a population density that would ensure the financial viability of a Knocklyon-Rathfarnham Luas line, because these were not among the areas which the Government asked the RPA to consider.  The outcome of the study is that while a line is just about feasible, it will create traffic problems for other users and entail the loss of a substantial number of gardens in the Rathfarnham area.  At the end of the day, however, the population density along the route means that it will lose approximately &euro;2 million per year.  The report was designed to suggest that it was not feasible or economically viable to provide a Luas line for the Rathfarnham area.  From start to finish, this was a matter of election politics.</P>
        <P>We will not deal with Dublin&rsquo;s traffic problems by fooling around with QBCs or providing Dublin Bus with a few additional vehicles.  This city must be modernised.  London, Paris and Moscow have underground systems of a substantial nature by means of which very necessary and reliable public transport services are provided.  Amsterdam has a fantastic tram system, which is completely reliable and which runs through some of the narrowest streets one is likely to find in any city in Europe.  If a tram system is viable in Amsterdam, a Luas system for Rathfarnham, Knocklyon and the entire city of Dublin should also be viable.</P>
        <P>Somewhere along the line, choices must be made.  Part of the choice may be to substitute Luas for a bus service.  This might be done for a number of reasons.  The feasibility study to <Col N="287"/>which I refer is based on the assumption that there should be a single line and that there is a need to retain all bus services.  Instead of taking a fragmented approach to the provision of Luas-type railway links, there should be an overall plan for the entire city and county of Dublin.  As part of this plan, a map showing the areas where metro and Luas-type transport systems would be provided, in substitution for bus services, where appropriate, over a specific period of years should be provided.  We should also realign bus routes in order that there would be a public transport service available to people who would not have ready access to the new systems to which I refer.</P>
        <P>I have seen no moves being made in the direction I have suggested.  I am not optimistic that the DTA will implement initiatives such as those I have mentioned, particularly in light of the continuing vested interests of all the sub-bodies below it, including Dublin Bus.  The latter will continue to operate in a particular way within its own dominion.</P>
        <P>We need a comprehensive transport plan that is not based on fragmented and piecemeal development.  There is no other city in the world in which two Luas lines, such as those which run from Tallaght and Sandyford to the city centre, would have been built without their being linked.  This was an amazing development.  Not only are the lines not linked, there is also a suggestion that the carriages used on one cannot be used on the other.  It would take a comedian to come up with that, particularly when one considers that we are discussing a publicly-provided transport service.</P>
        <P>We must get real in respect of this matter.  I do not want to read about Green Party press conferences.  One of that party&rsquo;s Ministers represents my constituency, Dublin South.  Both he and the two Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies for the area made false commitments to voters during the most recent election campaign.  I want the terms of reference originally given to the RPA in respect of considering the feasibility of providing a light rail system in the Rathfarnham, Knocklyon, Ballycullen and Ballyboden areas to be revised.  There is a financially viable and structurally feasible route via which services could be provided to these areas and to which links that would grant people access to these services could be provided.</P>
        <P>There is no joined-up thinking with regard to the Luas line that runs through my constituency.  Deputy Connaughton referred earlier to park and ride facilities.  There are such facilities at some Luas stops but they are not in place at others.  Since Luas stations were established, local authorities have taken to removing the on-street parking which previously existed and which enabled people living in other parts of south Dublin, who did not want to drive into the city centre, to use the Luas.  This was done because so many cars were being parked adjacent to Luas stations that it caused irritation to those who lived nearby.  That is understandable.  However, where is the joined-up thinking?</P>
        <P>If one wants to put in place a Luas station and reduce the number of cars coming into the city centre, it is blindingly obvious that there is one thing one must do when building said station, namely, provide underground parking.  This is about long-term investment and not about providing a temporary solution to a problem.  It is also about providing a public transport service for the next 100 years.  I accept that it would be expensive to provide underground parking at a Luas station where over-ground parking could not be provided.  It must be done, however, particularly when one considers what will be required in the long term.  We should ensure that park and ride facilities are provided at any Luas stations that are developed in the future.</P>
        <P>No one should threaten to impose charges on those who drive into the centre of Dublin city until a public transport system which is reliable and which will allow people to access parts of the city and county in a reasonable way, without being obliged to wait for buses that are stuck in traffic gridlock, is put in place.  The imposition of congestion charges in London was feasible <Col N="288"/>and morally right because of that city&rsquo;s superb underground transport system and extraordinary bus service, which is substantially more efficient than that which obtains in Dublin.  There is also London&rsquo;s over-ground rail system, by means of which people living on its outskirts can be transported into the city in a way that is far more efficient than would be the case here.  Let us not pretend that our public transport system has advanced to a point where it is so sophisticated that we can justifiably charge people for bringing their cars into the city centre.</P>
        <P>In recent days, I saw the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, cycling out of the Leinster House complex at great haste.  He was obliged to take careful action in order not to knock down another member of the Government and to avoid the occurrence of an unexpected by-election in my constituency.  People should be obliged to use bicycles.  However, where are the city centre bicycle parks that would prevent people&rsquo;s bikes being stolen?  If we want people to cycle into the city from the outskirts, we should follow the example of the Netherlands.  Many years ago, I lived in Amsterdam for 12 months.  There are bike parking stations all over that city.  Such stations are very easily installed and are quite inexpensive and they allow people to secure their bicycles in a way that will prevent them from being stolen.  If we install bicycle parks, it would encourage young people to come into town.  However, they would only do so if they felt safe on their bikes.  The only way to make them feel save is by putting in place cycle lanes in the parts of the city centre where they do not currently exist.</P>
        <P>We should not be obliged to endure press conferences hosted by the Green Party at which its members seek publicity and call on themselves in government to do certain things.  There should be real action and genuine steps should be taken to alleviate the transport difficulties that affect all of us who live in this city we love.</P>

	<P>It is time to catch a Luas to the north side.  I call Deputy Cyprian Brady.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus roimh An Bille um &Uacute;dar&aacute;s Iompair Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath 2008.</P>
        <P>Irrespective of whether they represent urban or rural constituencies, Members continually deal with matters relating to public and private transport.  I welcome the publication of the Bill, the main purpose of which is to place a single, properly accountable public body, the Dublin transport authority, in overall charge of surface transport in the greater Dublin area.  A primary objective is to ensure the delivery of the Transport 21 investment, which is currently under way, and create a high-quality integrated and, most importantly, sustainable transport system that meets the needs of people living and working in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>The necessary structures to streamline the planning and implementation of transport infrastructure and services in the greater Dublin area will be put in place by this Bill.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, pointed out last night, the greater Dublin area is the most densely populated region suffering the worst traffic congestion in the State.  It is covered by seven local authorities, including Dublin city, Fingal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, South Dublin, Wicklow, Meath and Kildare.  He also pointed out that the total number of vehicles registered in the greater Dublin area with local authorities in 2006 was 836,000.  That number has grown since.  The Minister of State also indicated the population of the region is close to 1.6 million people.</P>
        <P>This is a substantial amount of vehicles and people and we need to encourage all those people to convert to public transport.  It is imperative we do so.  However, without a properly functioning public service, we cannot blame people for choosing to take their cars to work. <Col N="289"/> One should consider that an individual pays out an initial sum to purchase a car and goes on to insure the car and themselves and tax it as well.  On a wet and windy Monday morning, the apparent choice of standing at a bus stop or train station for 20 minutes or half an hour or getting into a car means there is no choice.  People will always choose a car unless we can provide a suitable and efficient alternative.</P>
        <P>I see on a regular basis in my constituency of Dublin Central evidence that the current public transport system is at times inadequate.  In far too many instances, the buses and trains are full by the time they reach my constituents on the outskirts of Dublin.  This must be addressed and this Bill should provide people with an efficient and effective alternative to using their own cars.  It is about encouraging people and making it simple and easy for them to access public transport.</P>
        <P>A modern society requires a modern infrastructure.  Since coming to office in 1997, Fianna F&aacute;il in Government has moved to correct the impact of decades of under-investment in our transport infrastructure by committing unprecedented funding to this area.  I will list a few of the achievements so far.  There has been a complete overhaul of our rail service in terms of track and new rolling stock.  Anybody who takes a train on a regular basis will have seen a difference.  Although parts of the system must be improved and modernised, there has been a significant improvement overall in both stock and the quality of trains.</P>
        <P>There are over 1,100 new buses for Dublin Bus, including 100 delivered over December 2006 and January 2007.  The quality of buses has improved greatly from the days of the smoke-filled double decker buses which had people crammed on.  There is a modern and efficient fleet.  Importantly, going back to the time when Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke was Minister with responsibility for transport, accessibility for wheelchair users on the bus system has improved greatly.</P>
        <P>There are also over 600 new buses for Bus &Eacute;ireann and quality bus corridors have been introduced successfully in Dublin and are being rolled out in the other cities.  The local authority took responsibility, making a hard decision and many people were not happy with the introduction of the corridors.  They have made a significant difference.  The route on the Stillorgan road has made a big difference.  It is about encouraging people and providing them with an alternative service.</P>
        <P>The success of Luas means it is being touted as the jewel in the crown, and it carries over 26 million passengers annually.  I will return to the Luas later.</P>
        <P>There has been a doubling of capacity for passengers on the DART, along with upgrading of stations.  I take this opportunity to congratulate CIE on the work it has done on the DART stations and its rolling stock.  There is a difference from when the DART was introduced, when at peak hours and even off-peak there were significant problems getting access to the train because of the sheer numbers using it.  CIE undertook a significant programme of improvement and extending rail platforms and stops.  It has also invested heavily in increasing rolling stock, which has made a big difference to the millions users every year.</P>
        <P>Whether they are coming into the city centre from the suburbs or going from the north side to the south side, the numbers speak for themselves.  The footfall through DART stations is very significant.</P>
        <P>We also have a vibrant aviation sector.  From 1997, we have had 200% growth in passenger numbers at the regional airports, including 110% growth at Dublin, 100% at Shannon and an increase of 150% at Cork.  We must plan and design our infrastructure around these increases and pressures which are being brought to bear on our air transport system.</P>
        <P>The ten-year, &euro;34 billion capital Transport 21 investment programme, which was launched in November 2005, will deliver significant infrastructural renewal.  A number of key policy <Col N="290"/>priorities in the plan include the timely and cost-effective implementation of the planned public transport infrastructure projects.  There is also the effective integration of public transport services, including the development of an integrated ticketing service and the creation of a single public transport brand.</P>
        <P>This Bill continues the work which has been done.  A number of speakers mentioned the integration of the ticketing systems and any of us who have travelled to other cities around Europe will have seen that it works immensely well where such a system is in place.  A person can go to a shop or booth to purchase a ticket which will get them on to a train, light rail, the metro and buses.  Much work has been done by the Dublin Transportation Office in this area and the co-ordination of the various bodies is an issue.  I hope, with the introduction of the Dublin transport authority, the various interests can be pulled together to put a form on the technologies available for the integration of ticketing systems to produce a brand that can be sold as the greater Dublin area brand for transport throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I will outline some of the main provisions of the Bill, which contains seven parts.  Part 1<b> </b>deals with general matters such as definitions of key terms and relates to certain standard legislative provisions.  Part<b> </b>2 relates to the Dublin transport authority and concerns arrangements for establishment of the authority.  The general objectives and functions to be pursued by the authority are set out in sections 10 and 11.  The authority is required to prepare a draft transport strategy for the approval of the Minister setting out the strategic transport requirements for the greater Dublin area under section 12, and a six-year integrated implementation plan is also required under section 13, with a six-year review mechanism.  Considering the change in technologies in transport around the world, which is immensely quick, we must keep up.  We should not be afraid of looking at the experiences of cities abroad.  Some, including the Dublin Transportation Office, have looked at various systems in place around Europe and the world, and we should not be afraid of looking at them to tailor such systems to our requirements.  It is incumbent on us to get the maximum value for money from all these projects.  If there are existing systems or technology &mdash; mechanical or ICT &mdash; we should look at them.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Chapter 2 of Part 2 concerns the structure and governance arrangements of the authority.  Given the large amount of Exchequer funds being allocated to the authority &mdash; under the Bill, some &euro;4 million will initially be allocated to set up the interim board.  The direct selection and appointment of the board will be made by the Minister.  This will ensure adequate accountability and that the most appropriate people are appointed.  I am delighted to see there is an onus on the board to consult widely with the various stakeholders, including local authorities, groups and especially communities.  In my experience major infrastructure programmes cause disruption on a daily basis to people living and working around such developments.  Prior consultation and providing adequate information initially may save trouble later.  Lack of a good communications strategy and lack of information gives rise to rumour and innuendo, and people become concerned about their living environment and about their future and that of their children.  A case in point is the group in the Drumcondra area, Residents for Realignment Limited, which campaigns for the realignment of the metro north.  It has done significant work in trying to build lines of communication between itself and the transport developer.  I am delighted that this legislation requires the board to do that.  Under section 13 there is also a requirement to consult in regard to the six-year integrated implementation plan.  Again it is incumbent on all authorities, but particularly when it comes to major infrastructural development, to make any plans available to the communities and people who will be directly affected by them.</P>
        <P>The authority, consisting of ten members, will be appointed by the Minister, and the board will be responsible for performing the functions of the authority.  Section 17 also provides for <Col N="291"/>the appointment by the Minister of a 13 member advisory council, which will scrutinise the work of the authority.  I have experience of a similar type of framework in the context of the Grangegorman Development Agency which is a member of a consultative group which feeds directly into the board of the development agency and works extremely well.  It opens up lines of communication with the board, clarifies decisions being made and gives people an opportunity to have an input into how projects are developing.  The members of the board of the advisory council will include the Dublin City Manager and two county managers from the greater Dublin area or their nominated officers, four elected officers of the Dublin and Mid-East Regional Authorities, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and four ordinary members nominated by representative organisations.  It is incumbent on agencies and authorities such as the one currently proposed to have a representative spread of people who are directly affected by any developments they may undertake.  The board is subject to consultation with the National Development Finance Agency which has proved to be hugely successful in recent times in terms of financing arrangements.  The chief executive officer of the authority is subject to summons before the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees of the Houses.  This gives us direct access into how the authority does its work and how the experts and professional people employed by the authority can be influenced, and the authority will have to justify its decisions.</P>
        <P>The possibility of incorporating the Commission for Taxi Regulation within the DTA by way of Committee Stage amendment is also being considered by the Minister.  It would be an extremely good idea to include the Commission for Taxi Regulation within the DTA because it has a major role.  Over the years taxi drivers have proved that they have a service to offer the people of Dublin and the wider community.  In suburban areas taxis are as important as other public transport services.  It would, therefore, be a good idea to incorporate the taxi regulator within the DTA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Railway Procurement Agency will continue as a separate body.  However, the responsibility for integrated ticketing will transfer to the DTA.  The integration of services is a major priority as regards Dublin city.  Given the experience of the past number of years, the increase in traffic, the increased population in Dublin city and the wider area, ongoing management and integration of services will be crucial in resolving the problems we are currently experiencing<b>.</b></P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 3 of the Bill comprises six chapters dealing with various aspects of the transport system.  A number of important provisions which are designed to progress the development of a fully integrated transport system in the greater Dublin area are contained in Chapter 3 of Part 3.  Section 44 in particular gives responsibility for the development of lands adjacent to any public transport infrastructure.  I have had experience over the years of organisations and entities such as CIE, who are major landowners in the city area, being unable to properly secure and maintain their properties.  This has caused major problems for people living in the vicinity.  Bringing them under the DTA will co-ordinate matters and allocate responsibilities in that area.  Section 64 deals specifically with the management of construction projects.  I will speak later on those in Dublin city centre.</P>
        <P>The Bill refers to local traffic plans.  I would like the Minister to clarify what is meant by the term &ldquo;local traffic plans&rdquo;.  Does it refer to a particular locality within the city, to a suburb or to the wider area and counties surrounding Dublin?</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the Bill outlines a number of provisions relating to enforcement.  Section 51 ensures the safety, efficiency and quality of service by empowering the agency to alter public service contracts.  As public representatives there is an onus on us to ensure value for money but also to ensure safety and efficiency.  This is included in the Bill.  The Bill also provides for the appointment of authorised officers under section 78 and these officers will have the authority <Col N="292"/>to enter premises.  We have a very good and strong traffic corps within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, we are now at the stage where we must consider having a dedicated traffic police service, whether it is a transport police or what is called in the United States a metro police service.  As time goes on and numbers increase, problems will also increase so that we will need a dedicated transport policing service.</P>
        <P>Part 5 of the Bill deals with integrating land use and transport planning.  The Ministers for Transport and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have powers to ensure consistency between transport and land use policies.  That is an important requirement under planning.  To avoid problems further down the road, planning and design must be done at a very early stage, again getting all the stakeholders involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill deals with other matters, including the interconnector, the Luas and the metro.  There is a huge working and residential population in Dublin city centre who must be consulted and taken into account when engaging in major design and planning of the infrastructure being planned for the city.  The less disruption and the less interference with people&rsquo;s lives and environment, the better.  That can be achieved, particularly with the proposed authority in place.  I commend the bill to the House.</P>

	<P>Most Deputies could talk for hours on transport.  I listened with great interest to Deputy Brady&rsquo;s speech.  He covered many of the areas we all wish to cover.  The matter is dear to all our hearts as traffic and traffic management is a major problem.</P>
        <P>The first issue I wish to deal with was touched on by Deputy Brady.  I hope the Dublin transport authority will have a role in local authority area plans and traffic plans in other counties.  In many cases local area plans involve building new roads, key link roads and cycle lanes, but as they are subject to development, developers are being asked to construct them in addition to houses.  I do not have a problem with that, but when a developer decides not to rush a development the key road or other aspect of infrastructure is also delayed.  Given the slowdown in housing construction we must find a way to ensure those key pieces of infrastructure such as cycle lanes, link roads or parts of bypasses around towns, for example, around Navan in my constituency or Trim where the Minister is from, will not be delayed if construction projects do not proceed.  It should be possible for local authorities to develop those projects and to charge the developer at a later stage.  We cannot wait three or four years for key infrastructure while a developer decides to develop a project.  There is nothing wrong with the way the previous zoning system worked but we have a problem now as infrastructural projects could be delayed.  I presume the Dublin transport authority can do that job but perhaps that is not the case.  It is important that the issue is not ignored because it could lead to serious problems.  I assume the problem is not just confined to County Meath.</P>
        <P>I welcome the setting up of the new authority.  I have been involved with the Dublin Transportation Office, which has been subsumed into the new authority, in recent months.  I have attended some meetings and workshops about its strategy for future planning.  The debates there have been impressive and good ideas have been discussed.  Issues other than traffic have been addressed including those relating to quality of life &mdash; not being stuck in traffic &mdash; the green city and what we want to be known for in Dublin and the greater Dublin region.  Areas other than transport that were discussed include the provision of jobs and parks.  I welcome the broad thinking that has emerged from the DTO.  Transport plans are not just about transport, they are about where transport brings one, and what one wants to do in terms of work, play, voluntary work and community involvement among other things.  Transport is a key link in all of that.  I welcome the talks and look forward to those issues becoming part of the new authority&rsquo;s plan once power has been handed over to it.</P>
        <P>I am concerned the House will lose some accountability once the authority is in place.  I approve of authorities being set up when they are needed &mdash; not like many agencies &mdash; but it is wrong that we will not have daily accountability.  The authority will have to get the approval of the Minister for a six-yearly interim plan and a 12-year plan but that is not the same as daily accountability.  We can all agree on the big projects and where we want to go but daily accountability is required to get things done.  When Ministers have to answer parliamentary questions, they answer them.  That is accountability.  We know from the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office and Ministers&rsquo; offices that half of the questions submitted do not get answered for various reasons but that is a matter for another day.  We will not have daily accountability if the authority is not answerable by means of parliamentary questions and through the Minister to this House.  It is a shame we will lose that.  We have a chance to get this right for once and it is a pity to throw the chance away.</P>
        <P>It is suggested in the Bill that there will be a 12 to 20 year strategy plan.  That is not long enough.  The failure of the past ten to 15 years is due to a lack planning.  The authority we are <Col N="294"/>setting up today is years late, especially in terms of the land use study.  It is a great idea but is years too late.  We need to plan ahead not just for 12 years or 20 years but for 15 years, 25 years and 30 years.  In order to properly fund projects they should be spread over a longer period of time.  On the other hand, six-year integrated plans are too long.  We should have two-year or three-year plans.  Having a six-year plan is an acceptance that it should take six years to provide certain infrastructural projects when it should not.  We have been told the extension of the railway line from Dunboyne to Navan could take six years.  That is not acceptable.  It should not take six years.  Other countries can complete similar projects in one or two years.  We cannot allow six years to become the normal term for an interim plan.  We should insist that the plans are for two years or three years.  We need much faster results.  We want the authority to be able to take direct action and to achieve results.  It must be set out in the legislation that we expect more from the authority than just to have nice ideas and to talk about issues.</P>
        <P>The Bill states the authority will carry out transport assessment plans for all planning applications.  That is not rocket science and it should have been done long before now.  We discussed that in my first years as a councillor, yet it did not happen.  Many of the ideas coming through in the Bill have been discussed by Deputies and councillors and the average person for many years.  It is a pity it has taken so long to incorporate those ideas in the Bill and bring it to the House.  I accept we are discussing the Bill and that is progress but I hope when the authority is set up that matters will move more quickly.  I accept the DTO has done a lot of work, which means the authority should be able to hit the ground running.  It will have to do that because there is a great deal of work to be done.</P>
        <P>The Minister is to allocate money to the authority.  I am not convinced on that point.  I fear we will potentially have another Health Service Executive or National Roads Authority.  In some ways those bodies are good but in other ways they are not.  Perhaps the Minister should hold on to the money and allocate it for projects when the authority makes a case to him for funding.  I agree with the provision of a rolling budget for administration but not for big projects.  I do not like the way Ministers want to hand over responsibility for so many areas.  Accountability is at the root of the issue.  I can guarantee the Minister will still be seen cutting the ribbon when the projects are completed but if they do not work the Minister will not be there.  We are picking and choosing what we want to do.  That will suit the Opposition as we do not intend to be here all the time.  We hope to get over to the other side of the House at some stage.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>Politicians need to take more responsibility not less.  The public expects us to take on more decision making and to take responsibility, not to give it away.  What is needed is an authority to help with day to day implementation and getting projects completed, and to give good advice.  We are being deluded that the HSE is a separate authority when it is not.  The Health Act 2006 that set up the HSE clearly stated that its job was to implement Government policy and that the CEO of the HSE could not question Government policy.  The con job in recent years is that the HSE sets policy when that is not the case &mdash; the Minister sets it.  In this case we are handing over all responsibility for transport in the greater Dublin area and I have concerns about that.  I do not say the HSE has worked either.</P>
        <P>We are told that branding will be left to the transport authority.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd has asked questions about the millions of euro being spent on Transport 21 plans and advertisements.  I saw one of the advertisements last night and it is nice to look at.  It made me feel good but we <Col N="295"/>do not need to spend &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million on that.  We could use the money to fix some of the problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>The public does not need to be convinced about good ideas.  If something is good there is no need to advertise it.  I hope we will not spend a fortune on branding the new authority and spending more money on advertising to change it every couple of years.  If we are to have branding I suggest we let schools come up with ideas and involve young people in the process.  That would save us money and get young people involved in politics and let them see how things happen.</P>
        <P>It is suggested two county managers will be involved in the authority.  I am not convinced that will work.  The county manager of each county or a nominated individual from each county should be on the board of the authority.  That would ensure each county is fully clued in to what is going on and what are the plans.  It would also obviate the need to have further meetings when those concerned are involved at every stage of the decision making process.  The authority is not just for Dublin, it includes all the counties in the greater Dublin region.  Bad planning has resulted in many areas in the region missing out.  They have suffered due to bad planning and a lack of an integrated approach in terms of transport planning.</P>
        <P>One of the first tasks of the new authority should be to review the spatial strategy.  That spatial strategy completely ignored the greater Dublin region, which was a mistake.  Likewise the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation plan did not take into account the greater Dublin region.  We should be using those outer counties of Louth, Meath, Wicklow, Kildare and so on as a springboard from the capital city to the other areas.  In addition to gateways and hubs, we need another level to link them together.  That should be the middle linking city to the other regions.  We missed that opportunity.  The national spatial strategy, which is rarely discussed here, hardly mentions the greater Dublin region, which is a pity.  While this is a transport authority, it will do much more than that.  It needs to get involved in that aspect to ensure money gets allocated in future.</P>
        <P>I hope this authority will bring about many simple changes as well as big changes.  Simple things like integrated ticketing should have been introduced a long time ago.  I say it is simple because we are handing the power over to the authority as if it will be simple, but it is not.  There will be big problems from the unions.  I believe the Minister is looking forward to getting rid of this problem and handing it over to the authority.  I ask the unions to show some responsibility and commitment to public service on this issue.  We need to have proper integrated systems of ticketing, traffic control and moving of traffic between trains and buses and so on.  They are not in competition with each other.  All their jobs are safe.  Let us get it together and make it work for the sake of the country.</P>
        <P>I hope we will be able to learn from other European cities that seem to get it right.  Regardless of how busy those cities are, there is a sense of tranquillity about them.  In this city and around us in the greater Dublin region it is always stress and panic as a result of traffic problems.  The authority will have a big job.  It can be simply done if it brings in some simple measures along the way, for example changing traffic lights at night-time.  It is not all rocket science and big projects.  Many little ideas can be implemented, but I will not go through them now because I hope we will get the chance to do so on Committee Stage.  There are many small things an authority like this can do if it is given the real power to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy English for allowing me to share time to speak on this Bill.  Public transport is crucial at this point in our development as a society.  We have a considerable amount to do to catch up regarding public transport.  Other European capital <Col N="296"/>cities have very mature public transport systems that work, run on time, are clean and move many people quickly and safely from one point to another, which is what people want.  It is a good idea to integrate these functions under one authority so that everyone is working together.</P>
        <P>One of the issues we on this side of the House have with this authority and other quangos that have been established is that there does not seem to be accountability as Deputy English mentioned.  When the then Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, established the Railway Procurement Agency she said it would be accountable here through parliamentary questions, but that did not happen.  The issue of accountability in the democratic process is very important.  When Deputies try to raise issues in the House, we find we cannot do so for various reasons.  I hope the Dublin transport authority will be run in a better way than Irish Rail.</P>
        <P>As we speak, all trains from Cork to Dublin have been cancelled.  Thousands of commuters have been left stranded without notice, including people with hospital appointments, people visiting other people, people on business and myself &mdash; I need to go home this evening.  There is a lightening strike in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann today and all the trains to and from Cork are stopped.  This has been festering for some time.  The industrial relations between some of the workers and management in the company are not good.  I have been told that it has been brought to a head because a train driver this morning was asked to move a train from one location to another.  He contended it was not part of his job, but management claimed it was and decided to take him off the payroll.  His colleagues have now decided not to work until he is reinstated.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the thousands of commuters who are left stranded in Cork, Dublin and in between.  As the Ceann Comhairle knows, I tried to raise this as a special motion under Standing Order 21 as I believed it was an urgent issue that arose at midday.  However, I was refused permission to do so by the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office.  Thousands of our citizens will be stranded for the night.  There is a big concert in Dublin and accommodation is at a premium.  This is a matter that should be debated here with the Minister.  Ultimately the Minister should be responsible for these issues, but obviously he is not.  He washes his hands of it by claiming it is an industrial relations matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and nothing to do with him.  That is not good enough.  The Minister should be here this evening to debate the issue and tell us what has happened to lead to this situation and what he intends to do about it.</P>
        <P>I take the opportunity to call on all sides to get together and resolve this matter quickly.  I do not want it going on over the weekend and getting worse as people get entrenched.  I am told drivers are sitting in Kent Station in Cork as we speak.  I hope some movement is occurring.  It is not possible to raise an urgent matter like this in the Parliament.  Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will advise us what an urgent matter is.  What can be raised here?  We talk about the relevance of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Thousands of people would like this matter to be debated here this evening and we cannot do so.  Apart from that, the industrial relations problems between workers and management that have led to this strike should have been anticipated some time ago and dealt with.  It cannot be that difficult.  I know Ministers and Ministers of State do not really mind because they have State cars with drivers.  They look out through tinted glass at the world as it goes by, but the ordinary person in the street does not have that luxury and must travel by train.</P>
        <P>We are now establishing a Dublin transport authority and let us hope the same will not happen to that authority.  Let us hope we can have accountability through here if public money is involved so that we can raise issues with Ministers if something happens suddenly that will inconvenience hundreds or thousands of our citizens.  People ask how relevant is the D&aacute;il.  It is no wonder people are switching off politics when we cannot raise an issue like this.  I have managed to come in and speak on the debate on the Dublin Transport Authority Bill and, <Col N="297"/>strictly speaking, I am stretching beyond what I should in making this example.  However, it is the only opportunity I have to do so.  If another Bill was being taken this evening I probably could not do that.  However, the matter relates to transport.</P>
        <P>If the Minister is listening somewhere I ask him to take notice of what is happening in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and try to resolve the strike straightaway to ensure that commuters are not stranded overnight.  What is a person who is in Heuston Station this evening after having a hospital appointment to do if no accommodation is available in Dublin?  How will such people get home?  It would take seven or eight hours on a bus, if enough buses are available.  The trains are always full.  In fairness to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the Department and anyone else involved, the train service between Cork and Dublin has improved enormously.  Trains run on the hour every hour and the trains are of a very high standard.  They still take longer to travel than they used to ten years ago, but that is another issue.</P>
        <P>The problem is that this should not be happening and the industrial relations machinery of the State should have kicked in to ensure it did not arise.  Bringing this to a head, if that is the tactic management is using, is not good enough.  The workers downing tools and inconveniencing thousands of commuters without notice is not good enough either.  There is wrong on both sides.  I ask that action be taken straightaway to sort this out.</P>
        <P>I hope the Dublin transport authority will work.  It is badly needed.  We were told years ago that we would have integrated ticketing, but that has not happened.  Perhaps it will happen in the next decade.  Public transport is vital.  It is important that it is fast, efficient, safe and timely, without the disruption that is occurring as we speak on the train route between Cork and Dublin.</P>

        <Quest> if a medevac helicopter is located at the Irish battalion headquarters in Chad; if not, the location of the nearest medevac helicopter to the battalion headquarters in Chad; the approximate flying time from there to the battalion headquarters and from that headquarters to the nearest level 2 medical facility; the approximate flying time from the furthest extremity of the Irish area of operations to the nearest level 2 medical facility; if the medevac helicopters available can operate in all weathers; the alternative arrangements that have been made in the event of the helicopters not being able to operate; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>If a medical emergency arises, the most important aspect is that the troops in question have immediate access to appropriate medical care to treat any injuries and, if necessary, stabilise the patient.  In the case of the Defence Forces contingent in Chad, three doctors, along with a team of fully trained emergency medical technicians, will be deployed with the force in Goz Beida at all times and will accompany troops when they are out on patrol.  In the event of an injury, the medical personnel will stabilise the patient and determine the further care requirements and the optimum way to provide such care.  In some cases that may be a return to the Irish base in an ambulance and onward transmission to a role 2 facility in Abeche, with subsequent medevac or repatriation <Col N="298"/>from Abeche.  In some cases it may be that the further care required is to evacuate the patient from the area of the incident to a safe area where a helicopter can land and then medevac to a role 1 or role 2 facility.  </P>
        <P>A medevac helicopter is currently located in Abeche.  Two other helicopters being provided by Poland will also be located in Abeche.  Three other medium lift helicopters and a fixed wing medevac aircraft will be located at N&rsquo;Djamena.  A landing area and fuel supplies are available at the Irish base in Goz Beida.  Helicopters, therefore, could be deployed forward from Abeche to Goz Beida as required.  Arrangements for the deployment of additional helicopters and fixed wing aircraft from Russia and the Ukraine are currently being finalised.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the military authorities that they are fully satisfied with the existing arrangements.  However, as a contingency, the option of having a helicopter based full-time in Goz Beida is currently under examination and further planning is ongoing in that regard.  I assure the House that if there is a requirement to base helicopters in Goz Beida, that will be done.</P>
        <P>Regarding the other detailed and specific information sought by the Deputy, the following is the position.  Abeche, where the medevac helicopters and role 2 facility is located, is approximately 190 km from Goz Beida and just over one hour flying time.  The maximum flying duration from the most extreme possible point of the Irish operations to a role 2 facility is one hour and 50 minutes.  The medevac helicopters can operate in all-weather conditions and have night flying capability.  In addition, the air strip at Goz Beida can accommodate a fixed wing medevac aircraft.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the fact that the Minister has made a commitment to provide whatever backup services are required, will he ensure that a medevac helicopter is provided at Goz Beida at all times?  It takes approximately an hour to get from Abeche to Goz Beida by helicopter and if it must carry on to the outer extremity of the section the Irish mission will control, it could take up to two hours.  The Minister mentioned one hour 50 minutes but I have no doubt he is aware of the golden hour in that when somebody is seriously injured on the field they are taken to a level 2 military hospital within an hour.  From what the Minister said earlier, that requirement cannot be fulfilled.  I appeal to the Minister that if the proper medical service is to be available to our troops, it should be provided at Goz Beida.  I am aware he is examining the possibility of further helicopters being provided.  The Minister should insist on that because the feedback I am getting indicates there is concern that such a service is not available.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware that the rainy season is about to commence, which will coincide with the arrival of the main part of the Irish mission, and that at times it will be impossible for jeeps to travel over land because of widespread flooding in the Irish sector?  Also, there is a concern that because of atmospheric conditions helicopters may not be able to travel long distances because of fuelling capacity.  Has that aspect been considered?  If, for example, helicopters cannot&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s question but he appears to have a misconception of what is meant by the golden hour.  The golden hour is the availability of immediate medical treatment and, as I said in my initial reply, any Irish patrol going out on operation will be accompanied by one or more medical officers and a number of other people <Col N="299"/>who are medically qualified, some of whom will be paramedics.  They will be available to provide treatment immediately.  We have found that in many cases the patient needs to be stabilised, even if they have to be taken to a level 1 or level 2 hospital subsequently.  That is the reality on the ground.</P>
        <P>Deputy Deenihan asked if I was aware of the situation and I have discussed it with various people.  As late as this morning, I discussed the matter with the Chief of Staff and the operation commander, Lieutenant General Nash.  They have both assured me, and asked me to communicate to the House, that they are perfectly satisfied with the arrangements in place.  In fact, in so far as the travelling times are concerned, I recall&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We had fewer medical facilities, fewer air assets and further distances to travel in Liberia.  This is one of the best supported missions from the point of view of safety in which we have ever engaged.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> the position regarding the plans for members of the Reserve Defence Force to serve on overseas missions; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[20166/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The White Paper on Defence outlines the blue print for a new Reserve Defence Force.  This blueprint outlined a new reserve with a clearly defined role, an enhanced relationship with the Permanent Defence Force, better equipment and training and opportunities for reservists to serve on overseas peace support missions.</P>
        <P>An implementation plan has been developed that will ensure the realisation of the White Paper vision.  The plan is being rolled out over the period to the end of 2009.  There has been significant progress to date in implementing the detailed recommendations of the plan, for example, a new organisation structure implemented and major improvements in clothing, equipment, training and resourcing.  In addition, the reserve is now organised along similar lines to the PDF and the development of the integrated element of the reserve is in its second year.  All of these changes are enhancing the capabilities of the reserve as well as improving interoperability with the PDF.  These factors are significant enablers in facilitating future participation by reserve personnel in overseas missions.</P>
        <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains the commitment to fully execute the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, implementation plan by the end 2009 target, including the introduction of procedures to allow suitably qualified RDF personnel serve on overseas duties.</P>
        <P>There are no plans for participation by members of the reserve in overseas missions in the current year.  However, it is hoped that a small number of reservists will be available to serve overseas by the end of next year, 2009.  As specified in the plan, any such participation by members of the reserve is likely to be in specialised areas such as medical, transport, engineering and communications and information services.  This will also be subject to personnel having suitable qualifications, their personal availability and appropriate advance training.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Coming from Kildare I am aware of the great interest in the Defence Forces and the Army reserve.  What are the current numbers in regard to the reserve?  What is the age profile of reservists?  In the groups I am aware of many of them are young people and, therefore, overseas missions will play a major part in their willingness to continue in the Reserve Defence Force.  </P><Col N="300"/>
        <P>In that regard, how will the Minister balance the obvious need highlighted in other reports about a shortage in the Medical Corps and so on with increasing interest among members of the Reserve Defence Force to serve overseas in a medical capacity or whatever?  How can we generate that interest and ensure they continue to participate and that it is not just a seven day whim for them to be members of the Defence Forces?  We must ensure that we see a continued growth in that regard.</P>
        <P>The first movement in that direction will see a whole new emphasis as regards the reserve forces.  Given the age profile, does this mean that a good many young people are really interested in this?  The follow-on from it should be that as we move forward there will be far greater participation from the reserve Defence Forces overseas, to complement the Permanent Defence Force.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards Deputy Wall&rsquo;s first question, the number, I am informed, is 8,265 of which 7,914 are Army and 317 are Naval Service.  I do not have the age profile, although it has reduced considerably in recent years.  I shall get that detail for Deputy Wall.  On how to create an interest, I suppose the best way is to encourage people to join the reserve and discourage them from leaving it once they join.  The section of the White Paper concerned with the reserve force is all about that.  There is better training, equipment and resourcing as well as the development of the integrated reserve.  Development of the latter has been much slower than we thought, yet it is coming on considerably as of last year.  These reforms must be put in place.  We have now done that and are allowing them to be bedded down.  There are two other simultaneous steps.  One is the development of the frontline reserve, which we are hoping to find a useful role for and we are looking at a report on that.  The second is the question of allowing reservists to serve overseas.  In this regard, next year we are hoping to have a limited number of reservists who will be enabled to serve overseas.  Depending on the experience gained from that participation, we shall develop this.  Obviously, it will require discussions with employers etc.  I anticipate that sufficient numbers of people will be available without getting into changing labour law, having agreements with IBEC or whatever, to start the initiative.  From inquiries I am getting, there is quite a degree of interest.  I have no doubt that when we decide on a quota of reservists, we shall be sending them overseas next year.  It will probably be in technical areas such as transport, engineering, communications etc., but I have no doubt we shall have no difficulty whatsoever in fulfilling that quota. </P>

        <Quest> the progress that has been made in appointing consultants to carry out a review of the Defence Forces medical services; the proposed terms of reference for the consultants; the date by which it is anticipated the consultants will submit their report to him; if he will publish the consultants&rsquo; report; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Military medical services and their facilities exist to maintain the health of the Defence Forces and to support them in operational and overseas activities.  The focus of the military medical service is on primary care, occupational medicine, acute trauma management, preventative medical programmes and field medical training.</P>
        <P>The challenges in the medical arena have been recognised for some time and a review of the provision of medical services, in association with the representative associations, is ongoing as part of the modernisation agenda for the Defence Forces.  In view of the complexity of the challenge facing the Defence Forces in this area, I decided to engage consultants to make recommendations on the best means of meeting their medical requirements.  The consultancy <Col N="301"/>will focus on the sustainable provision of the relevant medical expertise and services to the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The consultancy is expected to deliver the following items: a review of the medical input required for the Defence Forces in the light of their roles and operations, an assessment of the current arrangements for the provision of medical services, a recommendation regarding sustainable future provision of the required medical input,and a work plan, outlining the main projects necessary, with timescales and a costing matrix for the implementation of recommendations.</P>
        <P>It is expected a contract will be awarded shortly and I expect the report to be delivered before the end of the year.  I eagerly await receipt of the report and I assure the House that following consideration of the recommendations I will publish the report and engage with all of the key stakeholders on the way ahead.</P>
        <P>The development of the medical corps forms part of An Agreed Programme for Government.  I am committed to providing a sustainable medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad.  Notwithstanding the current situation I can assure the House that Defence Forces personnel requiring medical treatment are getting the care they need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter of genuine concern for the Defence Forces in view of the fact that the PWC report and also the White Paper recommend an establishment of 47 doctors.  I understand we have 23 currently, ten of whom are non-nationals.  It is a major issue and something that cannot just be passed over lightly.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister indicate when will the consultants be appointed and commence their work?  Can he give a precise date on when he expects them to report?  He mentioned they would engage with all interest groups.  Will they engage with RACO, PDFORRA, military personnel, the Department of Defence and the special ongoing committee that is examining medical services within the Defence Forces?</P>
        <P>In his reply, the Minister might indicate how much his Department is spending on engaging civilian medical practitioners for medical care in the Defence Forces and for outsourcing various services that could be provided if he had a full establishment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I must correct Deputy Deenihan slightly &mdash; 47 is the established figure, as he rightly says, and we have 22 currently.  Six are non-nationals, but of course they are properly qualified medical practitioners.  Basically, in recent times we have considerably improved pay and conditions, in agreement with the Department of Finance, for people working in the medical corps of the Army.  In addition, we have run a number of intensive recruitment campaigns, although unfortunately the results have been disappointing.  Since 2000 some 15 doctors have left the Army, and we have only managed to recruit ten, so obviously our numbers are down.</P>
        <P>As regards when the consultants will be appointed, the tender documents are being evaluated and I expect they will be in place within the next three weeks and told to get to work immediately.  I understand, from speaking to various people that we expect to be in possession of the consultants&rsquo; report before the end of the year.  Deputy Deenihan asked whether they would engage with RACO, PDFORRA etc.  I do not know whether the consultants will directly engage with those organisations, but certainly I shall publish the report and I shall engage with PDFORRA, RACO etc. as regards what the consultants say.  If the consultants want to talk directly to RACO, PDFORRA etc., I have no objection whatsoever.</P><Col N="302"/>
        <P>As regards Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s financial question about the amount of expenditure on doctors we employ because we have not got the medical personnel ourselves, the point must be made that if we did we should have to pay them anyway.  I do not have the figure to hand, but I will get it for the Deputy.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> the progress that has been made in implementing the commitment in the action plan under the pay agreement and modernisation agenda for the Defence Forces that the parties to the agreement would engage in discussions to identify and explore the full range of the challenges to achieving optimum structures and flexibility and would complete this element of their discussions by June 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[20063/08] </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The commitment to which the Deputy refers is one of 17 contained in the action plan under the pay agreement and modernisation agenda for the Defence Forces.  The action plan is itself derived from the modernisation agenda of March 2007 agreed with the Defence Forces representative associations and both are in turn, modelled on the Towards 2016 agreement between the social partners.</P>
        <P>This particular commitment, the opening one in the action plan, is in the nature of an overall statement of intent with regard to optimising the structures and flexibility in the Defence Forces.  The commitment is set in the context of the successful reduction in Permanent Defence Force numbers to 10,500 and maintenance of the three-brigade structure in line with the recommendations of the White Paper on Defence 2000.  The general commitment to modernisation and change is recited within this context.  I know the Deputy is fully aware of the tremendous progress that has been made in the modernisation of the Defence Forces since 2000 which is described in detail in the <i>White Paper on Defence 2000 &mdash; Review of Implementation</i>, published by my Department in April 2007.  The action plan elaborates on a wide range of further commitments across the whole spectrum of change and modernisation in the Defence Forces.  There are a number of these areas where significant progress has been made and others where work remains to be done.  These have been the subject of discussion in this House on many occasions, including today, on which I will be answering questions on medical services in the Defence Forces, the re-organisation of the Reserve Defence Force and civilianisation, among other subjects.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied with the overall progress made to date in implementing the action plan.  As provided for in the modernisation agenda and pay agreement, a performance verification group, PVG, monitors performance against the commitments set out in the action plan and makes recommendations as to whether the pay increases set out in the agreement are justified.  The Defence Forces representative associations, my Department and the military authorities are represented on the PVG.  The group has an independent chairman, Mr. Frank Murray, former Secretary General to the Government.</P>
        <P>The PVG meets on a regular basis to review progress on all elements of the action plan.  The two most recent meetings were on 12 December 2007 and 25 January 2008.  The next meeting is scheduled for 30 July 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the action plan, what progress has been made on garrison deployment, split units, the inability to redeploy personnel in certain circumstances, the number of personnel serving without appointments, SWAs, and the deployment of personnel enlisted prior to and after 1 January 1993?</P><Col N="303"/>
        <P>There is some concern over the number of women recruited to the Defence Forces.  The Minister launched a number of initiatives in this regard but apparently the recruitment rate is quite slow.  The initiatives are not succeeding.  Will the Minister be specific about the questions I have asked?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>We have made significant progress on the modernisation of the Army generally.  There are no less than 17 commitments in the action plan.  We are far advanced in respect of some and not as advanced as we would like to be in respect of others.  Needless to say, considerable progress has been made.</P>
        <P>Outside the context of the action plan, modernisation continues, virtually on a weekly basis.  Meetings take place weekly between the representative associations and the military on specific matters.</P>
        <P>On split garrisons and the other matters about which Deputy Deenihan asked, no proposals have been forwarded by management or the representative associations as yet.  With the benefit of hindsight, it is felt the commitment may have been made in too broad a manner in the final action plan to provide an effective framework for discussion on specific issues.  Instead, it has served very effectively to set the tone of the discussion for the remaining 16 commitments in the action plan, on some of which we have made considerable progress.</P>
        <P>On the recruitment of women, Deputy Deenihan will be aware that we reduced the height requirement from 5 ft. 4 in. to 5 ft. 2 in.  This increased the pool of women available to approximately 90% of all women.  We have also undertaken some research and the Chief of Staff will make some recommendations on its outcome.  The results of the research were quite positive in many ways.  Some 75% of women expressed satisfaction with Army life and up to 80% stated they were extremely happy.  Their experience was good.  A number of specific recommendations were made on how we recruit, including the means of advertisement and the setting up of recruitment stands.  I am awaiting specific proposals in this regard from the Chief of Staff and when I receive them I will take action.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> the action, in view of the statement by his Minister of State in this House on 10 April 2008 that in regard to the patients charter agreed for the Defence Forces he had been assured that issues such as publicising the charter, displaying names of medical personnel and the awareness of personnel with responsibility for the management of medical care would be addressed in the coming weeks, that has been taken in each of these areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[20064/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The challenges in the medical arena have been recognised for some time and a review of the provision of medical services, in association with the representative associations, is ongoing as part of the modernisation agenda for the Defence Forces.  The scope of the review includes the level of service to be provided to members of the Defence Forces and the resources required for the delivery of that service.  </P>
        <P>The review has produced the patients charter with the agreement of all parties, which I welcome.  The agreement on the patients charter identifies the rights of members of the Defence Forces as patients and their obligations as users of the Defence Forces medical services.  It also identifies the obligations on the providers of the services.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the patients charter is under way.  The military authorities have assured me that the patients charter has been published on the Medical Corps section of the Defence Forces intranet site.  In addition, copies have been circulated, for display, to all of the <Col N="304"/>medical aid posts and clinics.  The brigade medical officers have also been directed to implement its provisions.</P>
        <P>However, the full implementation of the charter is clearly dependent on the resolution of the structural, resource and other challenges facing the Medical Corps.  As I have stated, the challenges we face with medical services in the Defence Forces go beyond the patients charter.  It is but one item on the medical review agenda.</P>
        <P>As I have already advised, consultants are being engaged to make recommendations on the best means of meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces.  The patients charter will inform the deliberations of the consultants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The feedback I am receiving from certain elements of the Defence Forces is that the content of the patients charter has not been communicated to all the rank and file members.  Will the Minister ensure that this is done?  Will he appoint some high-ranking offices to take charge of the implementation of the patients charter?  This seems to make sense.  The charter is just not displayed at doctors&rsquo; surgeries and other locations in the barracks around the country.  I am sure it is possible to make its content known to every member of the Defence Forces by letter.  Some time ago, the Minister sent a communication to everyone in the country about the national emergency plan and, therefore, it should be possible to communicate the content of the patients charter to the 13,000 military personnel in the Defence Forces.  Some years ago, the content of the dignity charter was communicated and displayed widely.  The same should apply to the patients charter.</P>
        <P>Is there a commitment in the patients charter that every member of the Defence Forces will have a medical check in the course of any given year?  I understand there is,. but last year approximately 2,000 personnel did not have a medical check.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about communicating the content of the charter to every member of the Defence Forces.  I have no doubt that this was suggested to him but what we have done was requested at meetings of the representative associations and the military.  It was requested that the charter be published on the intranet site and communicated to the medical aid posts and clinics.  It was also requested that the medical aid officers be instructed to implement the charter in each brigade area.  Nobody made a request to me to communicate the content of the charter to every individual but I am quite open to it if the representatives want to approach me in that regard.</P>
        <P>Deputy Deenihan stated the charter is not displayed at all the appropriate locations.  I was informed by the people to whom I spoke in recent days that it is displayed quite prominently in certain areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Not every area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not displayed in every area yet.  Some of the measures in the charter will not be implemented until we manage to deal with the structural problems we have been discussing.  I will certainly consider and talk to people about the suggestion that a particular officer be appointed to take charge of the charter.</P>
        <P>There is a commitment in the charter to offering an annual medical check to every member of the Defence Forces.  We hope to do better in this regard this year but, as I stated, circumstances will not be ideal until the underlying problems are dealt with effectively.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 8, 11, 16, 23, 40, 44, 50, 232 and 235 together.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Preparations for the deployment of the 97th Infantry Battalion to the UN mandated European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic are being implemented in a series of carefully planned phases.  To date preparations are on schedule.  A total of 394 members of the Permanent Defence Force are serving with this mission at present.  Included in this figure is the first chalk of 162 members of the 97th infantry battalion, who arrived in Chad on 19 May, the Army Ranger Wing and the advance party.  The final deployment of a further 140 personnel, of whom eight will be deployed to the force headquarters in Abeche and 132 with the 97th infantry battalion, is scheduled to take place on 1 June.  A number of the advance group, who were deployed to construct the camp and transport the equipment, will be repatriated in early June.  Twenty-eight personnel were subject to mandatory selection for the mission to date.  The total deployment with this mission, following the withdrawal of the advance party and the Army Ranger Wing, will amount to 425 personnel.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>Irish personnel, operating from the port of Douala in Cameroon have organised the movement forward by road, rail and air of the Defence Forces equipment to the headquarters of the Irish battalion at Goz Beida in eastern Chad, a distance of approximately 2,700 km.  Priority equipment and vehicles already have arrived in Goz Beida and the remaining equipment is <i>en route</i> at present.</P>
        <P>Key enablers, in particular tactical and medevac helicopters and medical facilities, are in place thus allowing the mission to proceed.  Having being satisfied that the capabilities required to support EUFOR&rsquo;s main force deployment had been established, Lieutenant General Nash, the EUFOR operation commander, declared the mission had achieved initial operational capability on 15 March 2008.  This marked the start date for the 12-month duration of the operation as set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1778.</P>
        <P>Camp construction in Goz Beida is progressing well.  Tented structures and multi-functional vehicle service tents have been erected.  Ablution units with shower facilities and toilet units also have been constructed and are operational.  The water towers also have been erected.  More tentage is expected to arrive in Goz Beida shortly, which will enable completion of camp construction.  The fuel farm holds 280,000 litres at present.</P>
        <P>The EUFOR mission has contracted Economat des Arm&eacute;es, EDA, which is a French company, for the provision of logistics support to all troop-contributing nations to the EUFOR mission.  This will include the delivery of fresh rations, which will commence on 29 May 2008.  Defence Forces logistics personnel will monitor the quality and level of this service to Irish personnel serving in Goz Beida.</P>
        <P>The number of resupply flights that will be used in support of Irish troops on the EUFOR Chad mission will be determined by the immediate requirements of troops on the ground and, therefore, this will determine the frequency of flights.  The load that is being carried, not the number of seats that are on the aircraft, will determine the type of aircraft that will be utilised.  The primary function of the sustainment flights will be to deliver supplies and services to the battalion in theatre.</P>
        <P>There are no plans at present to provide subsidised leave flights for any personnel on the mission.  The Irish personnel serving at the force headquarters will serve a six-month tour of duty.  They will be able to avail of leave, dependent on the force commander&rsquo;s instructions, during that tour of duty.  However, all costs associated with ongoing leave will be borne by the individual.</P><Col N="307"/>
        <P>Support flights are primarily to deliver supplies and services necessary for the day-to-day sustainment of our troops.  However, the frequency of the support flights may allow for a limited parcel facility to be offered to the next of kin at Christmas 2008.</P>
        <P>The theatre of operations for the Chad deployment poses serious logistical challenges due to the nature of the operation as well as the mission area and environment.  Force protection will, as always, be a key consideration and the Defence Forces will have all the required military hardware to fulfil their role in the mission.  The Defence Forces have deployed a full range of force protection assets, including 17 Mowag APCs and four close reconnaissance vehicles and indirect fire capabilities, that is, mortars.  These will provide the necessary armoured protection, mobility, firepower and communications.  The military authorities have indicated that while the level of risk is consistent with any operational deployment into a troubled African State, it is one which the Defence Forces have the capability to manage.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces have deployed a suite of secure, robust, state-of-the art tactical communications systems to the EUFOR mission.  These systems have been deployed in appropriate quantities to support the effective conduct of operations.  The Defence Forces communications and information services corps are providing satellite communications and high frequency radio, e-mail and telephone access to the Defence Forces&rsquo; networked management and administration information systems.  In addition, all personnel will be provided with the facilities to make telephone calls to family and friends and will have access to the Internet.</P>

	<P>When the replies to questions are lumped together in this fashion, a difficulty arises in that it becomes difficult to ask specific questions in return.  I refer to Question No. 6, in reply to which the Minister provided the specific breakdown between mandatory and voluntary selection.  Why did mandatory selection take place?  Was it because there was an insufficient number of volunteers?  On what basis were those personnel who were selected mandatorily recruited?  How is the list formed?  What is the selection process?  In what order are personnel likely to be selected?  Do selected personnel have an opportunity to opt in or out?  If they have specific family circumstances are they simply obliged to go or do circumstances exist in which they would be excused?</P>
        <P>It is important that people should know the system and how it operates.  In addition, the system should be seen to be just, fair and transparent.  I seek the Minister&rsquo;s response in this regard first as I wish to ask a number of other questions, as does Deputy Wall.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Of the 394 personnel who are there at present, a total of 28 have been mandatorily selected.  The military authorities have their own procedure for mandatory selection.  While I am not immediately familiar with it, I can get details of it for the Deputy.  I am told the system has been in place literally since the foundation of the State.  However, I understand that someone who is mandatorily selected but who wishes to be excused can make representations to the appropriate personnel within the military high command.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the issue of supports to the mission.  Parcels at Christmas could be very good for the morale of the forces serving there.  While the Minister mentioned there may be provision in this regard, I suggest that provision should be made for the transport of parcels.  I am sure it would not overly inconvenience the Defence Forces were such parcels to be placed at local barracks from where they easily could be transported.</P>
        <P>At present, I understand that those who are serving on the mission will receive only ten minutes of free telephone call time per month.  In view of the importance of this highly challenging mission, in which temperatures will rise to 50&deg; or 55&deg; Celsius, every support possible must <Col N="308"/>be given to the Irish military personnel in Chad.  Will the Minister consider increasing the allowance to at least 20 minutes of free telephone time, which would be fair.</P>
        <P>The former Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Tom Kitt, took some of the Minister&rsquo;s questions during Question Time in the House.  I believe he will be a loss to this House given his profile.  However, in response to a question, he promised me that he would check the position in respect of subsidised leave flights.  Perhaps one of the Minister&rsquo;s officials has provided the Minister with a note on subsidised leave flights for personnel serving there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Deenihan has asked three questions.  As for parcels, the primary purpose of the resupply flights will be to supply appropriate provisions and equipment and other necessities for the troops.  The military authorities have advised me that they may be able to make some provision for parcels at Christmas.  I will certainly communicate Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s sentiments to the military.  I share his view that we should try to accommodate parcels from next of kin as much as possible.  </P>
        <P>Regarding subsidised leave flights, only one element of the deployment to Chad will be there for a full six month period.  In Liberia and on other missions troops were deployed for a six month rotation period.  Six months is quite a long time so they get leave to come home in the middle of the period, after around three months.  As Chad is so far away and inaccessible, instead of a six month deployment there will only be a four month deployment and there will not be leave during that period.  However, staff at the headquarters in Paris, which is not far away, and at the force headquarters in Abeche will be deployed for six months.  Happily, there is an international airport at N&rsquo;Djamena and those who are deployed for six months will be able to fly home from there.</P>
        <P>There is a myth around subsidised flights.  There was no direct air access to Liberia so people who wished to go home mid-term were taken on charter flights by the army.  They had to pay for this service, although I do not know what the rate was.  Only a small number of people are at issue in this regard.  I am not overly concerned about those deployed in Paris, but we may be able to provide assistance to those deployed at the headquarters in Abeche.  I will examine this matter, although I understand this has been the standard procedure for Irish troops abroad for some time.  For example, when we had troops in the Lebanon, Eritrea and Ethiopia this system applied.</P>
        <P>Regarding Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s reference to an allowance of ten minutes per month of telephone calls, I was not aware this was the case and nobody brought it to my attention.  I will look into this matter because an allowance of ten minutes per month strikes me as somewhat skimpy, if that is the case.  I do not doubt what the Deputy has said.  I would have thought a person from the representative association would have brought this to my attention by now.  We will examine the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Some weeks ago I availed of an invitation from the Commander in Chief to visit the Curragh with my colleagues, the Minister of State, Se&aacute;n Power and Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, to examine the logistical programme that was being put in place for this mission.  Only being there and seeing the vast amount of work that went into organising this allowed one to realise what it is all about.  Everyone involved should be congratulated as it is a wonderful achievement for the Defence Forces to partake in this mission.  It was unbelievable to see the amount of work that went into organising and supporting it.  I concur with the sentiments of the Minister and Deputy Deenihan on the family factor, telephone calls, Christmas and so <Col N="309"/>on and that every effort should be made to alleviate the concerns of family members.  I am sure the Minister will take in the points we have made in this regard.</P>
        <P><i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 14 April wrote of the medical teams that travel overseas and it stated that the Department of Defence had to recruit foreign doctors for overseas service.  It stated that the results of this were mixed.  Were foreign doctors recruited because there were not enough Irish doctors to travel with the group?  If so, what kind of investigations into their backgrounds were made?  If one is to believe what was written, it did not make good reading to see that one of the doctors had the mission concluded and another did not have the necessary qualifications.  One would not wish to see such things happen on this mission.</P>
        <P>How were interpreters that travel with the group recruited?  What mechanism does the Department use to ensure they are <i>au fait</i> with the areas, the languages of different tribes and so on?  A recent newspaper report relates an encounter between the Army Rangers and a rebel group and it was the interaction of the interpreters between these sides that made all the difference.  According to this report it was the first time the group engaged in an oral interaction and they did so because the Irish troops were so agreeable in this case.  How many interpreters are being used by our troops in Chad and how are they employed?  Do interpreters and troops interact to develop confidence?  This is of major significance in overcoming challenging situations like that related in the newspaper report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I note Deputy Wall&rsquo;s remarks on the huge amount of organisation and effort that has gone into putting this mission together and I thank him for them.  I will convey his sentiments to the Chief of Staff.  </P>
        <P>Regarding family concerns, access to families, parcels and so on, I have already undertaken, in reply to a number of questions from Deputy Deenihan, to do what I can to provide assistance.  This is a challenging mission and I appreciate the worries of families.  I have spoken to many of them and wish to do everything I can to make things as easy as possible for them.</P>
        <P>Deputy Wall raised a valid point on the qualifications of medical personnel recruited recently.  As was said in reply to an earlier question, we found it increasingly difficult to recruit doctors here and we will come back to this matter in a later question.  We even found it increasingly difficult to recruit doctors in mainland Europe so we have been forced to look further afield.  As far as I know six of the 22 doctors we currently employ are foreign nationals, though I think one has taken Irish citizenship.  The Deputy is correct that until recently there were difficulties recruiting doctors.  An individual was found to have forged qualifications.  In another case a female doctor from Nigeria, who was perfectly qualified and, I am told, an excellent doctor, had a number of criminal convictions in other countries for tax evasion and other offences.  We did not know about this and since those incidents the checking procedure has been considerably tightened.</P>
        <P>The Army has its own way of choosing interpreters and I will get the Deputy the relevant details.  I am informed that the military is very happy with the interpreters it has and this was illustrated last Sunday in the meeting the Deputy referred to where the two interpreters interacted very well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with a number of questions.  Regarding medical evacuations, I wish to emphasise again the importance of having a medevac helicopter in Goz Beida.  The fact that Abeche is such a distance from the Irish sector will definitely make travelling times a problem.  Will there be dedicated helicopters in Abeche for the Irish mission?  If there was another demand on medevac helicopters in Abeche and a member of the Irish force <Col N="310"/>was seriously injured in the Irish sector would that person have to wait for the arrival of a helicopter?</P>
        <P>Another problem that was mentioned in the newspaper report to which I referred is that the atmospheric conditions create difficulties with helicopter travel from the point of view of fuelling arrangements.  Apparently in certain conditions it takes more fuel to get from A to B because the helicopter&rsquo;s engines must work harder.  It is important to clarify this in order to put people&rsquo;s fears to rest.  I remind the Minister of his statement in the House that because this was a generously funded mission every support would be provided.  The most important support, because of the conditions and because it would be impossible during the rainy season to travel overland by jeep or military ambulance, is helicopters, and the ready availability of helicopters is critical.  I ask the Minister to respond to the question of providing a helicopter at the Irish headquarters at Goz Beida.  Does he agree that it would be better if one were there?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already told Deputy Deenihan that the military is considering whether a helicopter should be placed permanently at Goz Beida.  I will not try to second-guess the military as I am not a military expert, but I have been assured that if it is decided that it is necessary for the safety of Irish troops that a helicopter be located at Goz Beida, a helicopter will be located there.</P>
        <P>With regard to Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s specific question about Abeche, three helicopters are available there.  They are not dedicated to any specific mission, but in that part of Chad there are French, Irish and Polish forces.  Those three helicopters are generally available.  I must point out, however, that there are three other helicopters available at N&rsquo;Djamena, plus a fixed-wing aircraft.  Negotiations between the EUFOR commanders and the Russians and Ukrainians are at an advanced stage with a view to providing further air back-up.  Compared with other missions with which I am familiar, such as that in Liberia, the troops are much better served on this mission with regard to flying times and accessibility of medical facilities and air assets.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 13 and 28 together.</P>
        <P>On Monday 14 April 2008, the public information and awareness campaign on emergency planning was launched at the National Emergency Co-ordination Centre.  The main focus of the campaign was the publication and country-wide distribution of a handbook entitled Preparing for Major Emergencies.  To coincide with the launch of the campaign, a three-week advertising campaign was undertaken to let people know about the handbook and to encourage every<Col N="311"/>one to read it.  Advertisements were placed in national and provincial newspapers, on radio and on advertisement billboards around the country.</P>
        <P>It is planned to review the impact of the campaign later in the year.  Obviously it will be important to ensure that the information is relevant and up to date.  However, the handbook is specifically designed to contain generic information which will not change.  More detailed information is available on the website <i>www.emergencyplanning.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>It is important that the information contained in the handbook is equally available to the new Irish communities.  For this reason the handbook was made available on the website in Polish, Russian and Chinese.  During the launch period of the campaign there were more than 3,000 hits on the website but it is not possible to say how many were from those communities.</P>
        <P>As chairman of the Government task force on emergency planning, I am conscious of the need to maintain public awareness of the excellent work that is being undertaken in this area by Government Departments and public authorities and I will continue to encourage further initiatives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently attended a session of the Oireachtas education programme initiated by the Ceann Comhairle.  With regard to the booklet Preparing for Major Emergencies, it may be possible for those running the programme in the individual schools to incorporate the booklet as part of the programme.  I am not sure how many booklets were printed so perhaps the Minister will tell me.  In most instances when we talk about schools we are talking about the next generation, but the next generation is only three or four years away.  We are passing on vital information to these students.  It has taken some time to bring the programme to its present stage.  It is important to incorporate the emergency planning booklet into the programme.  If this were done it would also mean that when a book was brought home by an individual student there would be discussion of it within the family, creating further interest in the issue which will last longer than the publications and advertisements associated with the initial launch.</P>
        <P>Local radio is now a major contributor to rural and community life.  Is the Minister satisfied that the launch campaign was sufficient in this regard?  News items and so on are particularly noticeable.  How many booklets were printed in Russian, Polish and Chinese?  Was there much demand for them?  The Minister said he could not differentiate between language speakers in calculating the number of hits on the website, but was there much demand for booklets in each of these languages?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a slight misunderstanding here.  No booklets were printed in Russian, Polish or Chinese.  The information was made available in these languages on the website.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, I thought they were.  That was my mistake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked about local radio.  We deliberately chose to advertise in the print media, both local and national newspapers, on local and national radio and on billboards throughout the country.  Television advertising is extremely expensive, and we are trying to keep costs down.  The total cost of the campaign was slightly more than &euro;2 million, of which about 25% went on advertising.  I am fairly confident the campaign was successful.  We will do a limited amount of research later in the year to find out how successful the campaign actually was, but it certainly brought the issue to the public&rsquo;s attention.</P><Col N="312"/>
        <P>One thing I deplored was the cynical attitude of certain columnists to the whole exercise.  The reason we conducted the campaign was that most people did not know we had an emergency plan in place and the handful of people who knew there was an emergency plan did not know what it involved.  We also heard many comments about how simple the information in the booklet was.  We did research with the public before the booklet was produced and we found this was exactly what they wanted.  They wanted reassurance that there was a plan in place rather than details on the specific aspects of any plan.  Much more detailed information is available on the website and there are a number of contact telephone numbers that people can call to get more information.  I deplore the cynical attitude I mentioned.  The booklet was produced based on similar projects in such places as the UK and Australia.  We did no more and no less than that &mdash; we spent a lot less than had been spent in other countries.  A total of &euro;2 million to print and distribute the booklet and advertise in the newspapers and on national radio was quite a small sum in the overall scheme of things.</P>
        <P>I did not understand the Deputy&rsquo;s first question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle has initiated an Oireachtas education programme under which members of the Oireachtas staff visit transition year students in schools and introduce a package explaining the operation of the Houses.  The official begins by staying with the class for 30 minutes, after which Members attend for an interactive questions and answers session.  Could the booklet be included in this package?  I do not know whether booklets are available, but it could create interest from an educational perspective.  The children could interact with their parents concerning the booklet after going home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the Deputy for misunderstanding, but I accept his point.  It is a useful suggestion that I will discuss with the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Civil Defence Board was established in 2003.  The board produces a strategic plan every three years, the most recent of which, covering the period 2007-10, was launched by me last September.  Copies of the plan have been laid before the House.  The strategies identified by the board for the management and development of the Civil Defence place a high priority on the organisation&rsquo;s involvement in developing training and recruitment programmes and in the framework for major emergency management, which identifies a wider role for the Civil Defence in emergency response.</P>
        <P>In 2007, the Civil Defence Board received a grant of almost &euro;6.1 million from my Department and it is my intention that this level of funding be maintained.  In each of the past three years, the board has expended on average almost &euro;1 million on the purchase of equipment, enabling the board to equip volunteers to a high standard.  In this regard, the board introduced new Civil <Col N="313"/>Defence work wear in 2006, which has enhanced the image of the organisation and assisted the board in attracting and retaining new members.</P>
        <P>Recently, considerable expenditure on training, first aid, rescue and communications equipment, in addition to boats and vehicles, has helped to transform the Civil Defence into a modern multifunctional emergency response organisation.  The board has re-equipped all of its casualty volunteers with up-to-date training manuals, DVDs and instructional material, bringing the organisation into line with the statutory requirements laid down by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC.  The board has also invested considerable resources in re-equipping Civil Defence technical rescue teams since 2006.</P>
        <P>Marketing the capabilities of the Civil Defence is an important strategy in meeting the target of increasing membership by 10% by 2010 as identified in the board&rsquo;s strategic plan.  While the recruitment of Civil Defence members is a local authority function, the Civil Defence Board both encourages and supports local authorities, through their Civil Defence officers, to undertake recruitment campaigns.  The board supports these recruitment initiatives through the provision of additional publicity material and media training for Civil Defence officers and other supports that help to enhance the image of the Civil Defence.  Targeted recruitment programmes also take place in the form of public awareness campaigns and new training classes at various locations around the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Civil Defence on its work, some of which is difficult, to say the least.  For example, its members must trawl rivers and so on when unfortunate family members have been lost in our rivers or lakes.</P>
        <P>Regarding the replacement of equipment, one particular unit was unable to carry out its duties because its replacement boat was not licensed to participate in the exercise.  Does this matter lie within the remit of the Civil Defence or is it a matter for the Defence Forces, which do good work in my area?  Alternatively, must the Department of Transport investigate whether the boats are suitable before granting licences?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Wall for his remarks regarding the Civil Defence and I will pass on his compliments.  I am sorry to learn of the specific case and that people could not engage in a rescue mission because they did not have a licence to operate the boat.  I will get an answer for the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The number of medical staff within the Defence Forces is 31, comprising 22 medical officers-doctors, four dentists, one periodontist and four pharmacists.  In addition, there are 24 members of the Army nursing service.</P>
        <P>The key resource issue in the provision of medical services to the Defence Forces is the acknowledged shortage of doctors in the Medical Corps.  While the establishment for medical officers is 47, only 22 are serving in the Defence Forces.  The difficulties with the recruitment <Col N="314"/>of medical officers have endured for some time despite the concerted efforts of my Department and the Defence Forces.  The pay and allowances of doctors and dentists were recently increased substantially in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  In addition, the Defence Forces have recently undertaken an intensive recruitment campaign.  The results of both of these initiatives have been disappointing.</P>
        <P>The challenges in the medical arena have been recognised for some time and a review of the provision of medical services, in association with the representative associations, is ongoing as part of the modernisation agenda for the Defence Forces.  The scope of the review includes the level of service to be provided to members of the Defence Forces and the resources required for the delivery of that service.</P>
        <P>In view of the complexity of the challenge to resolve the structural, resource and other issues facing the Medical Corps, I have decided to engage consultants to make recommendations on the best means of meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces.  The consultancy will deal with all relevant issues affecting the sustainable provision of the relevant medical expertise and services to the Defence Forces.  As part of this work, the consultants will be asked to review the career prospects being offered to young doctors, opportunities for career development and membership of specialist registers.  They will also examine the range of services required by the Defence Forces at home and overseas and options on sustainable future provision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The development of the capacity of the Medical Corps forms part of An Agreed Programme for Government.  I am committed to providing a sustainable medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad.  Notwithstanding the current situation with the provision of medical services, I assure the House that Defence Forces personnel requiring medical treatment are getting the care they need.</P>

	<P>While we have discussed this matter already, it is urgent that the Defence Forces have the proper medical backup.  For example, the dentist who provides a service for military personnel in the Curragh is going to Chad.  As such, no dentist will be available to the approximately 1,500 military personnel in the Curragh.  I asked whether the Minister could provide an answer as to the cost of outsourcing services to private medical practitioners.  The figure of &euro;1.5 million mentioned some years ago has probably increased due to the reduction in the number of doctors available within the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>This matter is about more than the provision of services.  It is important that medical personnel have a close knowledge of the Defence Forces so that the former know those with whom they are dealing, understand their complaints and are aware of the complexities.  It is a psychological matter as much as a medical one.  The importance of having as many Irish doctors as possible lies in psychology, in that they can communicate with military personnel better and have a better understanding of them. In saying this, I do not mean to cast aspersions on non-national personnel.  Effective communication is a particularly important consideration when it comes to missions.</P>
        <P>If we want to attract young doctors, male and female, into the Defence Forces, we must offer incentives.  One such incentive would be the provision of cr&egrave;che facilities, especially where there is a high concentration of medical personnel, such as in the Curragh.  I understand the Minister has established a committee to examine this issue.  Has that committee issued its recommendations?  Can the Minister indicate whether a cr&egrave;che facility will be provided in the Curragh?</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Army personnel who require medical service will receive it.  We do not have sufficient numbers of doctors in the Army, but we make up for this shortage by bringing them in from outside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>My point stands that we are not recruiting enough doctors into the Army.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody will be left without adequate medical treatment.  That notion is a fallacy.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, it would be more desirable to have a full complement of 47 doctors.  We have tried hard to build up to that number but, unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful.  We have increased the pay substantially and have undertaken several intensive recruitment campaigns.  The result, however, has been disappointing.  The difficulty, as I am informed by medical people, is that the career prospects for an Army doctor are limited.  That is why I am bringing in consultants, who I expect to appoint within the next three weeks, to find ways of attracting personnel into the Army so that we are no longer dependent on the private sector to supplement our medical corps.</P>
        <P>I have taken note of Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s question on funding and will communicate that information to him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights and at a previous Question Time, I made a request that Lieutenant General Nash be asked to address the committee on the mission to Chad.  I make that request again today.  Given that he appeared on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, I am sure he will be willing to attend a meeting of the committee to bring us up to date and answer any questions we may have.  Will the Minister make that request on the committee&rsquo;s behalf?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>If one takes it that an Army career is the chief ambition of cadets, is it not feasible that a number of them could be trained as doctors to work within the Defence Forces?  This would be a good way of building up our own medical corps.  The first objective for these people is to be part of Army life.  Instead of recruiting external medical personnel who may leave when they get a better offer, it is better to train internal people who are committed to the Army as a way of life.  Perhaps bursaries could be created to facilitate such a scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>As somebody who has been through the process of medical training, I may be able to offer the Minister some insight.  It is correct that medical services are being provided to Defence Forces personnel as required.  However, they are often provided by non-national doctors, some of whom have questionable qualifications.  This was a cause for particular concern in Liberia, for example.</P>
        <P>The main reason it is difficult to recruit young doctors into the Army is because they do not consider it a worthwhile experience.  Even if massive annual salaries of &euro;120,000 were offered, the problem would persist because young doctors do not consider a stint in the Army to be worth anything in terms of their career path.  It does not require a consultant to point to the obvious solution, which is to ask the colleges to consider including a military rotation, whether for six months or a year, as part of a senior house officer or registrar&rsquo;s GP and surgical training schemes.  Such an option would be attractive.  People, including myself prior to entering politics, who are interested in doing an Army stint would be extremely interested in a four or five-year training scheme which incorporates a year as part of the Defence Forces.  That is not currently <Col N="316"/>an option.  In terms of one&rsquo;s career progression, a year or two in the Army is effectively a waste of time.  Will the Minister&rsquo;s consultants consider such an approach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I will convey Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s request to Lieutenant General Nash to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.</P>
        <P>In regard to the points made by Deputies Wall and Varadkar, I agree it is a question of career progression.  I thank the Deputies for their suggestions, which I will pass on.  Deputy Varadkar is correct that it is not a question of money.  Doctors do not want to go into the Army because they do not see it as advancing their career.  If Deputy Varadkar wishes to submit his suggestion in writing or meet me to discuss it, he will be more than welcome.  I am open to all suggestions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 230 together.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force as the strength sufficient to meet all foreseeable military requirements for the period comprehended by the White Paper (i.e. up to 2010). This remains the position. It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. This recruitment will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper.</P>
        <P>The agreed Programme for Government provides for an additional provision of up to 350 troops to be in training at any given time.  However, due primarily to the requirement to prioritise funding for the Chad mission, it has not been possible to provide funding to activate this provision in 2008. This matter will be further considered in the context of the 2009 Estimates.  The White Paper on Defence provides for an allocation of up to 850 Permanent Defence Force personnel to be deployed overseas at any one time. While this may be exceeded for short periods, deployments above this level are not sustainable on an ongoing basis within existing resources.  Any commitments to EU or UN missions will be met within this context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The White Paper on Defence provides for a role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in relation to Search and Rescue. The commitment given in the agreed Programme for Government to promote greater cooperation and knowledge sharing between the Coast Guard, the Navy and Air Corps is to ensure that the waters surrounding this island are safe for seafarers and coastal communities.  The Irish Coast Guard, has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime Search and Rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue region, for pollution and salvage response in the marine environment, and for marine safety awareness.  The Naval Service and Air Corps provide support to the civil authorities in this regard as the need arises and within their available capability.</P><Col N="319"/>
        <P>A Service Level Agreement is currently being finalised between my Department and the Irish Coast Guard for the provision of services to the Coast Guard by the Defence Forces. The overall operation and implementation of the Service Level Agreement will be monitored by a Steering Group comprising representatives of my Department, the Defence Forces and the Irish Coast Guard. At an operational level, the parties to the Agreement are committed to the achievement of its objectives through co-operation and partnership between the main service providers.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department and the Defence Forces are represented on the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee, which is chaired by the Irish Coast Guard. The IMSAR Committee meets twice yearly and its functions are to keep under review the general arrangements for marine search and rescue in Ireland, to consider the implications of any intended changes in equipment, deployment or organisation in any arm of the Committee, and to consider as necessary liaison with neighbouring search and rescue organisations and any regional search and rescue agreements in which Ireland is a participant. The Defence Forces also participate in regular search and rescue training exercises with the Irish Coast Guard.</P>
        <P>The Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service and the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps are represented on the Marine Emergency Advisory Group which is a high level committee chaired by the Director of the Irish Coast Guard. The role of this group is to  assemble as a task force during major emergencies to advise on the appropriate response;  to review and amend  any plans in existence for dealing with marine emergencies in territorial waters and the Irish Search and Rescue Region and to approve new contingency plans; to consider the implications of any intended changes in equipment, deployment or organisation in any relevant agency in advance of such changes and to respond appropriately;  and to exercise the authority to commit the resources of their own agency to the emergency response.  The Naval Service and the Irish Coast Guard are represented on the National Maritime Security Committee chaired by Department of Transport which provides another useful forum for the exchange of experience and information between the Defence Forces and the civil authorities.</P>
        <P>The Air Corps is represented on the Ireland Search and Rescue Region Aviation Forum, a working group chaired by the Irish Coast Guard which meets twice yearly to review the technical and operational aspects of marine training missions involving helicopter assets, to exchange information on new techniques and equipment, to explore areas of commonality, and to highlight and report on specific joint operational problems to the IMSAR Committee.  I have recently approved the nomination of an Air Corps officer to the Irish Coast Guard Future Helicopter Study Group which is being established within the Department of Transport under the chair of the Director of the Coast Guard to define the specifications and contracting process for the future provision of marine emergency helicopter services for the Irish Coast Guard.  I am satisfied with the progress that is being made in regard to promoting greater co-operation and knowledge sharing between the Naval Service, Air Corps and the Irish Coast Guard with regard to maritime safety.</P>

	<P>Significant progress has been made recently in implementing schemes to enable more commissioning from the ranks.  The revised cadetship competition is now seen as the primary means of commissioning from the ranks. The cadetship competition has been revised to increase the maximum entry age to 28 and to award bonus marks to candidates with previous experience in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) or Reserve Defence Force (RDF).  Results for the 2006 and 2007 cadetship competitions were encouraging with a total of 23 applicants with military service in the Defence Forces being successful in the 2006 cadetship competition and a further 18 applicants with military service being successful in the 2007 cadetship competition.</P>
        <P>In addition, in the past two years, 5 members of the Defence Forces were commissioned as officers from Direct Entry Competitions for appointments as Engineer Officers in the Corps of Engineers, Conductors in the Army School of Music and Aeronautical Engineer Officers in the Air Corps. Arrangements are currently being made to commission a further member of the Defence Forces to fill an additional Aeronautical Engineer Officer vacancy in the Air Corps.  An internal Commissioning from the Ranks competition was held in June 2007.  This competition provided an opportunity for enlisted personnel who have passed the cadet entry age to compete for entry on a potential Officers Course and ultimately, a commission.  As a result of the competition a total of 24 applicants (23 males and 1 female) have been selected from the ranks of Junior and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers and have been in training in the Cadet School in the Curragh since 30 July 2007.  On successfully completing the course these enlisted personnel will be commissioned as officers of the Permanent Defence Force on 10 June 2008.</P>
        <P>The Policy on the running of similar future competitions, to provide Non-Commissioned Officers with the opportunity of obtaining commissioned rank is being addressed. This issue is also included in the Defence Forces Modernisation Action Plan agreed under &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;.  I have also asked the Chief of Staff for his views on the prospect of facilitating suitably qualified enlisted personnel to compete internally for technical/professional posts in the officer ranks in the future.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation plan provides for a phased approach to enhancing the capabilities of the Reserve over the period to the end of 2009. The introduction of new RDF organisational structures, the development of new training syllabi, improved equipment and clothing have successfully been delivered as part of phase 1 of the plan.  Phase 2 of the Implementation plan is currently being implemented and a pilot scheme for the integrated Army Reserve is under way. A total of 180 personnel have completed the required training in 2007.  In line with the Implementation plan timeframe, recommendations with respect to the First Line Reserve are to be brought forward during phase 2. Development of the First Line Reserve is also included in the Modernisation Agenda agreed with the Defence Forces Representative Associations in the context of Towards 2016 and will be advanced accordingly.</P>

	<P>I am very conscious of the commitment given by military personnel on overseas duty and the impact it has on their families and loved ones. Regular contact with home helps to sustain the high morale of military personnel serving overseas and facilitating communication with home is seen as a priority.  In the normal course of events all personnel serving overseas are entitled to one free five minute phone call per month. Special arrangements are provided in relation to duration of calls for personnel serving on isolated missions or in places where there is no local telecommunications infrastructure. With regard to the mission to Chad 45 minutes free telephone call credit per tour of duty is provided to personnel on a four month or less tour. 90 minutes free telephone call credit per tour of duty is provided to personnel on a six month tour.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 27 and 30 together.</P>
        <P>Military medical services and facilities exist to maintain the health of the Defence Forces and to support them in operational and overseas activities. The focus of the military medical service is on primary care, occupational medicine, acute trauma management, preventative medical programmes and field medical training.  The challenges in the medical arena have been recognised for some time and a review of the provision of medical services, in association with the Representative Associations, is ongoing as part of the Modernisation Agenda for the Defence Forces.  The scope of the review includes the level of service to be provided to members of the Defence Forces and the resources required for the delivery of that service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The review has already produced a Patients Charter.  The agreement on the Patients Charter identifies the rights of members of the Defence Forces as patients and their obligations as users of the Defence Forces medical services.  It also identifies the obligation on the providers of the services. The implementation of the Patients Charter is under way.  However, the full implementation of the Charter is clearly dependant on the resolution of the structural, resource and other challenges facing the Medical Corps.  In view of the complexity of the challenge facing the Defence Forces in this area, I decided to engage consultants to make recommendations on the best means of meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces. The consultancy will focus on the sustainable provision of the relevant medical expertise and services to the Defence Forces. The Consultancy is expected to deliver the following items:</P><Col N="324"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A review of the medical input required for the DF in the light of the roles and operations of the DF.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An assessment of the current arrangements for the provision of medical services.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A recommendation regarding sustainable future provision of the required medical input.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A work plan, outlining the main projects necessary, with timescales and a costing matrix for the implementation of recommendations.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">It is expected a contract will be awarded shortly and I expect the report to be delivered before the end of the year.  In relation to offering a rotation in the Defence Forces as part of post-graduate medical training scheme, I am open to any suggestion that will help to provide the medical resources required.  I expect that this and other possibilities for dealing with the shortage of medical personnel will be taken into consideration by the consultants.  However, I do not want to anticipate the analysis that will be undertaken.</P>
        <P>The Consultants will also look at the career prospects being offered to young Doctors, opportunities for career development and membership of specialist registers. They will also examine the range of services required by the Defence Forces at home and overseas and for options on the most appropriate skill set and qualifications for sustainable future provision.   I eagerly await receipt of the report and I can assure the House that following consideration of the recommendations I will publish the report and engage with all of the key stakeholders on the way ahead.  The development of the Medical Corps forms part of the agreed programme for Government. This includes the expansion of the capacity of the Medical Corps to deliver a range of medical facilities on UN mandated missions. I am committed to providing a sustainable medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad. Notwithstanding the current situation I can assure the House that Defence Forces personnel requiring medical treatment are getting the care they need.</P>

	<P>A breakdown of the number recruited into and discharged from the Reserve Defence Force since 1 January 2008 is in the form of a Tabular Statement.  The Reserve Defence Force (RDF) comprises the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve.  As of 31 March 2008, the number serving in the Army Reserve is 7,948 and in the Naval Service Reserve is 317.  The White Paper on Defence outlines the blueprint for the RDF.  An Implementation Plan has been developed to realise the White Paper vision and is being rolled out over the period to end 2009.   The RDF has already seen significant improvements in terms of organisation, clothing, equipment, training and resourcing.  It is now structured along similar lines to the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) and the development of the integrated element of the Reserve is in its second year.  All of these developments enhance the capabilities of the Reserve as well as improving interoperability with the PDF. </P><Col N="325"/>

	<P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force as the strength sufficient to meet all foreseeable military requirements for the period comprehended by the White Paper (i.e. up to 2010). This remains the position.  It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces.  This recruitment will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper.  To date, in 2008, a total of 168 general service recruits have been enlisted and 1 Doctor has been appointed to the Permanent Defence Force.  The agreed Programme for Government provides for an additional provision of up to 350 troops to be in training at any given time.  However, due primarily to the requirement to prioritise funding for the Chad mission, it has not been possible to provide funding to activate this provision in 2008. This matter will be further considered in the context of the 2009 Estimates.</P>

The Review noted some areas where civilianisation of military posts had been successfully implemented in the past and recommended that further work be done in this area.   Subsequent to the publication of the Review, civilianisation was incorporated into the &ldquo;Pay Agreement and Modernisation Agenda&rdquo; agreed with the Defence Forces Representative Associations in the context of the Towards 2016 Partnership Agreement.

	<P>The Lisbon Treaty will have no effect on Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality. As I have said on many occasions, Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality is in our hands and that is where it will be staying at all times. The Lisbon Treaty does not change or alter this position. The triple lock, requirement of Government decision, D&aacute;il approval and UN authorisation for any overseas deployment of members of the Defence Forces, is also unaffected by the Lisbon Treaty.</P><Col N="327"/>
        <P>The existing safeguards in the EU Treaties for Ireland&rsquo;s distinctive national approach are retained in the Lisbon Treaty.  These include the general requirement for unanimity in relation to decision-making in the Common Foreign and Security Policy area, in particular with regard to the launch of any European Union crisis-management mission.  No such mission can go ahead without our express approval.  The Treaty of Lisbon states that the Union&rsquo;s policy in this area &ldquo;shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States&rdquo;.  This recognises and protects the position of Ireland.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the proposed Constitutional amendment to allow the State ratify the Lisbon Treaty also confirms the prohibition on Ireland entering an EU common defence, unless the people of Ireland were to decide otherwise at some future point. As a result, any proposal relating to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in an EU common defence would require the express approval of the Irish people in a further referendum.</P>

This investment has been assisted by pay savings arising from the reduction in the strength of the Permanent Defence Force in the context of the White Paper of 2000, which have been re-invested in the provision of equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.  The level of investment has ensured that Defence Forces&rsquo; personnel have the most modern and effective range of equipment to carry out their day-to-day roles both at home and overseas and for training purposes.  I will ensure that this investment will continue into the future taking into account the clear commitment in the Programme for Government. </P>
        <P>From the Army&rsquo;s perspective the major investment has been in the contracts for Mowag Armoured Personnel Carriers. In the period from 2001 to 2007 the Defence Forces acquired a total of eighty Mowag APCs at a cost of &euro;120m. The APCs have been used extensively on overseas service. Currently there are twenty-two APCs in Chad and nine in Kosovo.  A tender competition has recently been initiated for the acquisition of Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles and tenders are due back in early July 2008.  The intention is that the LTAV will complement the Mowag APCs in the conduct of conventional and Peace Support Operations and will fill a gap that exists between soft-skinned vehicles and the Mowags.</P><Col N="328"/>
        <P>The proposal is to acquire an initial twenty-seven vehicles (17 for overseas mission and 10 at home for training).   The tender competition will allow for two additional options, for another twenty-seven vehicles.   There is a sum of &euro;6m in this years Estimates provision as a down payment on an LTAV contract.  In recent years, significant work has been carried out on the acquisition of an Integrated Protection and Load Carrying System for individual soldiers. This system includes Body Armour, Helmets, Back Packs (Rucksacks) and Battle Vests.  8000 units of Body Armour, 12,000 Helmets and 12,000 Rucksacks have been delivered in recent years at a combined total cost of &euro;13.5m.</P>
        <P>To complete the modern integrated protection and load carrying system, an order has been placed for the supply of 12,000 Battle Vests at a cost of some &euro;2.2m.  The Battle Vests are used for the carriage of essential items such as ammunition, personal radio, water and ancillary equipment.  The order will be completed by the second half of 2008.  Other equipment acquisitions for the Army in recent times, includes 400 General Purpose Machine guns acquired from FN Herstal in Belgium at a cost of &euro;4.4m.  A further 500 GPMGs have been ordered from FN Herstal for delivery late this year at a cost of &euro;5.7m. In addition 1,400 pistols were purchased from Heckler and Koch to replace the FN 9mm Browning Automatic at a cost of &euro;800,000.</P>
        <P>On the issue of training, I am very satisfied that military training techniques are up to date in all respects. Defence Forces training plans are structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them under the White Paper on Defence of February 2000. The challenges of preparing military units for participation in international peace support operations constitute the major dimension of Defence Forces collective training. The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards.</P>

Following on from the General Election in 2007, the Group had to be re-constituted from the current Oireachtas membership.  I wrote to all party leaders on the 17th January 2008, inviting them to nominate a representative to the Group. The nominations have been received and arrangements for the completion of the Consultation Group, including representation of Independent members, will be completed shortly.</P>

	<P>The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements.  In the 2000 White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that the Naval Service would be based on an 8-ship flotilla and committed to a modernisation and replacement strategy to maximise the operational capacity of those 8 vessels consistent with the roles assigned to the Naval Service.   The White Paper specifically provides that &ldquo;New <Col N="329"/>vessels will be brought on stream to replace older ones as these fall due for replacement&rdquo;.  Naval Service Vessels are replaced when they have come to the end of their useful life, which is normally around 30 years.  Three ships will fall due for replacement over the next 3 to 5 years &mdash; LE Emer, commissioned in 1978, LE Aoife, commissioned in 1979 and LE Aisling, commissioned in 1980. </P>
        <P>Following a detailed examination of the needs of the Naval Service within my Department a vessel replacement strategy for the Naval Service was put in place to cover the period up to 2012.  The strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a very high level.</P>
        <P>Following Government approval in July 2007 notice of a tender competition for the purchase of replacement vessels for the Naval Service was sent to the Official Journal of the European Union on 24 August 2007.  The competition is for the purchase of two Offshore Patrol Vessels with an option of a third and one Extended Patrol Vessel with an option on a second.  The options provide an effective value for money opportunity, at locked in prices, to provide replacements for Naval Service vessels which will reach the end of their service life in the years immediately following the current replacement programme. The competition uses a Restricted Procedure which comprises two stages &mdash; The first stage comprises a Request for Proposals and the second stage comprises an Invitation to Tender.  The closing date for stage 1 was 26 October 2007.  Evaluation of proposals has now been completed.  The second stage of the competition for the OPV will proceed as planned in late May/early June with the issue of a detailed specification to those who have qualified.  Tender evaluation will take place in July/August and it is intended to award a contract in late 2008.</P>
        <P>In relation to the larger EPV, my Department intends to undertake further analysis of the proposals in relation to the EPV project before the second stage is initiated.  Once this has been completed, my Department will review the matter with a view to initiating the second stage of the EPV competition, probably later in the Autumn.  The vessels will, subject to Government approval on funding, be delivered on a phased basis between 2010 and 2012.  The Government is committed to continuous investment in the equipment needs of the Naval Service to enable it to carry out the roles assigned to it.</P>

	<P>The current White Paper on Defence, which was published in February 2000, was the first-ever White Paper on Defence and set out the policy framework and development strategy for the period 2000 &mdash; 2010. The overall Government objective was to achieve affordable and sustainable Defence Forces capable of fulfilling the roles laid down by Government.</P>
        <P>A detailed review of White Paper implementation has been conducted and a report was published in April 2007 outlining the findings. The report found that substantial progress has been made. The many detailed recommendations for change that were laid out in the White Paper have been implemented or are being implemented according to agreed timetables. The report also concludes that all the detailed targets should be met within the time-frame of the White Paper i.e up to 2010.  The Department of Defence and Defence Forces Strategy Statement 2008 &mdash; 2010 includes the commitment to prepare a new White Paper on Defence, in line <Col N="330"/>with the Agreed Programme for Government. Work on this important project will be progressed over this period.</P>

	<P>Seven (7) females have been enlisted into the Permanent Defence Force to-date during 2008 out of a total intake of 169. It is not possible to project the number of females who might apply to enter the Defence Forces and who might succeed in that application. However, based on previous years, this figure might be expected to rise to fifty-five (55) by year end. A detailed breakdown of the number of females in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps by rank and the number of females that were recruited each year since 2005 are in the Tabular Statements.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. Female strength in the Permanent Defence Force has increased from 468 at the end of 2001 to 560 as at 19 May 2008.  Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. All promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit.</P>

	<P>The White Paper on Defence 2000 outlines the blueprint for the Reserve Defence Force (RDF). The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan provides for the phased enhancement of Reserve capabilities over the <Col N="332"/>period to the end of 2009. Revised organisation structures came into effect in October 2005. The Reserve has been re-organised along similar lines to the PDF with three brigades, a Reserve Defence Force Training Authority and a dedicated Naval Service Reserve. Improvements in clothing, equipment and training have been delivered. These factors were identified as being important issues for members of the Reserve, as well as being necessary to improve the overall capability of the Reserve.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Plan provides for the development of an Integrated Army Reserve. A pilot scheme for the Integrated Reserve was run in 2007 and while numbers participating were small (180 completed training), very valuable lessons were learned. The Integrated Reserve will continue to be developed in 2008 in the light of experience gained in 2007.   In line with the Implementation plan timeframe, recommendations with respect to the First Line Reserve are to be brought forward during phase 2. Development of the First Line Reserve is also included in the Modernisation Agenda agreed with the Defence Forces Representative Associations in the context of Towards 2016 and will be advanced accordingly.</P>
        <P>While there are no plans for participation by members of the Reserve in overseas missions in the current year, it is hoped that a small number of Reservists may be available to serve overseas by the end of next year (2009). This is likely to be in specialised areas such as medical, transport, engineering and communications and information services. This will also be subject to personnel having suitable qualifications, their personal availability and appropriate training.  In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, a publicity and awareness campaign to promote recruitment to the RDF is being prepared and will be carried out later in the year.</P>

	<P>On 24 April 2008, I met with Mr. Norbert Darabos, the Austrian Minister of Defence in Vienna.  I was accompanied in the talks by the Secretary General of the Department of Defence, Michael Howard; the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, Lt Gen Dermot Earley; Assistant Secretary General, Ciaran Murphy; and Mr Frank Cogan, Irish Ambassador to Vienna.</P>
        <P>A number of issues were discussed at our meeting including the situation in Kosovo and Chad, where both countries are involved in peacekeeping operations, as well as ESDP, Battlegroups and the Lisbon Treaty.  Minister Darabos informed me that he had visited Chad two weeks before our meeting. Minister Darabos was accompanied on his visit by representatives from the Austrian Media. He stated that all concerned were reassured by what they saw of the Force on the ground despite the difficult operating environment.  He welcomed the fact that the EUFOR Operation Commander (General Pat Nash) was from a fellow neutral country, Ireland, and that there was participation also by Sweden and Finland. The independence and multinational nature of the mission along with its humanitarian objectives were important issues for Austria.  In addition, Minister Darabos was very impressed by what Gen Nash had achieved as Operation Commander.</P>
        <P>I advised him that our preparations for the Defence Forces deployment in Chad were going well and that all 400 Irish troops would be in place by end-May. I also informed him that public opinion, in Ireland, was supportive of the mission, particularly in view of its humanitarian <Col N="333"/>objectives, to support those fleeing from the conflict in Darfur and also the Internally Displaced Persons in Chad.  We both agreed on the need to ensure that the UN would step in to provide the necessary continuity for EUFOR, which was essentially a bridging operation and also on the need to avoid &ldquo;mission creep&rdquo; both in terms of tasks and duration.</P>

	<P>During my visit to Kosovo on 23rd April 2008, I visited the Irish Troops based there. I was given a comprehensive briefing by Brigadier General Gerry Hegarty, Commander Multinational  Task Force (Centre). I also had meetings with:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Mr. Colm &Oacute; Conaill,  Political Adviser;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Mr. Joachim R&uuml;cker, the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary General (UNSRSG), and Head of the UN mission in Kosovo;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Deputy Prime Minister Kuci, and;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Major General Steltz, Deputy Commander, the International Security Force in Kosovo (KFOR) also briefed me on recent incidences in Kosovo.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">General Steltz was highly complimentary of the quality of the Irish Contingent and of its contribution to the discharge of the KFOR mission.  I was informed that following the declaration of independence by the Kosovo Government on 17 February 2008, the overall security situation continued to remain relatively calm in south Kosovo but still tense in the north. However, the situation is being monitored continuously. The Kosovo-Albanian&rsquo;s celebrations were peaceful and well managed. However, demonstrations continued in North Mitrovica, peaking on 17 March 2008 when UNMIK Police supported by KFOR intervened in order to remove and arrest the occupants of the courthouse in Mitrovica. In the clashes that followed, a number of UNMIK and KFOR personnel were injured and one (1) Ukrainian member of  UNMIK died as a result of injuries sustained in an explosion. There has been no further violence in Mitrovica since 17 March 2008 and UNMIK Police has resumed normal duties in Mitrovica.</P>
        <P>The situation in the Irish Area of Responsibility was described as calm and stable, though unpredictable. The threat of attacks on KFOR personnel was assessed as low.   The Irish Defence Forces Personnel are equipped with the most modern and effective equipment.  This equipment enables troops to carry out the mission assigned, as well as providing the required protection specific to the mission. I would like to assure the House that ongoing threat assessments are carried out in mission areas and we continually review both personal equipment and force assets, to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfil their roles. No mission is without danger, but I am satisfied that all appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the safety of all Defence Forces personnel serving in KFOR.</P>

The 2008 recruitment process is ongoing at this time. To date a total of 19 persons have been identified as suitable for the position of Private (Groom).  Prior to enlistment all such persons undergo normal intake procedures i.e. medical screening, physical training test and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Security Clearance.

	<P>The ongoing investment in modern equipment and facilities for the Defence Forces will continue in 2008, as will the major programme to provide modern accommodation for the Defence Forces, which has been ongoing over recent years.  From the Army&rsquo;s perspective the major investment has been in the contracts for Mowag Armoured Personnel Carriers. In the period from 2001 to 2007 the Defence Forces acquired a total of eighty Mowag APCs at a cost of &euro;120m. The APCs have been used extensively on overseas service. Currently there are twenty-two APCs in Chad and nine in Kosovo. A tender competition has now been initiated for the acquisition of Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles, with tenders due back in early July 2008.  There is a sum of &euro;6m in this years Estimates provision as a down payment on an LTAV contract. There has also been a very comprehensive investment programme in new equipment for the Air Corps and a tender competition for a ships replacement programme for the Naval Service is well under way.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s property portfolio is kept under on-going review. Properties deemed surplus to requirements are disposed of and the funds invested to meet the equipment and infrastructure needs of the Defence Forces. The total amount accrued from Department of Defence properties disposed of in 2007 was &euro;1.6 million. However, proceeds from property sales in any particular year are not linked to any specific project.</P>

	<P>The Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and Women, or &Oacute;glaigh N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na h&Eacute;ireann Teoranta (ONET) has enjoyed the long-standing official recognition of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  ONET is dedicated to looking after the welfare of all ex-service personnel of the Irish Defence Forces. A main objective of ONET is to ensure the welfare of ex-servicemen and women by way of providing accommodation to homeless members in need of such domestic accommodation and providing other assistance that may be required by way of advising referrals to the relevant agencies.</P>
        <P>The Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA) was formed in 1990. Membership is available to those, both serving and retired, who have successfully completed a tour of duty with a UN Force or Organisation.  Both associations are financed primarily through membership fees, voluntary contributions and fundraising.  The Agreed Programme for Government of June 2007 commits to the provision of annual subventions to support ONET and IUNVA in their valuable work. I have decided that this can best be achieved through the payment of an annual grant-in-aid to both of these voluntary organisations. I recently announced that arrangements have now been put in place for ONET and IUNVA to receive an annual grant-in-aid from my Department. This year, ONET and IUNVA will receive &euro;40,000 and &euro;10,000 respectively. It is planned to increase these amounts in subsequent years in line with changes in the Consumer Price Index.</P>

	<P>The Payment Services Directive (PSD) provides the necessary legal framework to support the development of the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA), a major payments industry initiative aimed at eliminating any remaining difference between domestic and cross-border payments within the eurozone. This Directive comes into effect on 1 November 2009. My Department is currently preparing legislation to apply the provisions of the PSD into Irish law. Stakeholders were invited to respond to a public consultation, which closed on the 16th May. Responses to that consultation are currently being studied in my Department.</P>
        <P>Article 52(3) of the Directive prohibits payment service providers from preventing merchants applying a surcharge or offering a reduction for the use of a given payment instrument. This is to ensure that the costs of efficient and inefficient payment instruments are transparent. Otherwise, all consumers would bear the costs of inefficient payment instruments as merchants would pass on charges in the form of a generally higher price level. This Article does allow Member States to forbid or limit the right to request charges. However, this can only be done if two conditions are satisfied, namely, that such a measure is consistent with the need to encourage competition and promote use of efficient payment instruments.</P><Col N="338"/>
        <P>In the context of its ongoing work on the transposition of the Directive my Department will be assessing the implications of Article 52 (3).  It would, however, be a priority to ensure that the use of efficient payment instruments is not disadvantaged.  As the Deputy will be aware, the greater use of more efficient electronic payments could yield significant competitive benefits to the Irish economy.</P>

        <Quest> if he will quantify the total amount of tax forfeited by Revenue by virtue of the tax exemption on stud fees since this scheme was first introduced. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 35 of the Finance Act 2003 provided that details of exempt income from a number of sources, including from stallion and greyhound stud fees, would be returned to the Revenue Commissioners.  This information was first included in personal income tax returns for the tax year 2004 filed in October and November 2005 and, in the case of companies, in corporation tax returns filed up to the end of 2005.  The relevant information available is based on tax returns by individuals and companies of tax exempt profits, including distributions out of exempt income, from greyhound and stallion stud fees for the tax years 2004, 2005 and 2006. Before that taxpayers were not required to include such income in their tax returns and the information sought by the Deputy is therefore not available for Exchequer costs incurred prior to 2004.</P>
        <P>Data for the tax year 2007 is not yet available as the income tax returns for that year are not due for filing until October 2008 (by 17th November 2008 in the case of returns filed via ROS) and the bulk of corresponding corporation tax returns are not due for filing until September 2008.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that  based on the information that has been received and collated to date, a total of &euro;29 million was included in the relevant returns for 2004 as profits or gains   exempt under section 231 of the Taxes Consolidation Act in relation to stud fees.  This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost of the order of &euro;11 million in 2004, in terms of income tax and corporation tax forgone; however, the actual Exchequer cost in relation to the income declared to date could be lower, to the extent that the exempt income would be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs, thereby reducing the level of income that is actually subject to tax.</P>
        <P>Corresponding data available for the tax years 2005 and 2006 indicate that some &euro;52 million and almost &euro;91 million respectively was included in the relevant returns for those years as tax exempt profits or gains corresponding to maximum Exchequer costs of the order of &euro;13 million for 2005 and &euro;22.5 million for 2006.  Such income will now be subject to tax from 31 July 2008.  It should be noted that Revenue were concerned at preliminary indications that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on exempt income and property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the 2004 Income Tax returns. Revenue  engaged with the tax practitioner bodies to draw attention to these deficiencies and to rectify them. Revenue also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they were correctly completed.</P>

	<P>I assume that the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the recommendation contained in the February 2006 report of the High Level Interdepartmental Committee established to examine the implementation of the Consumer Strategy Group (CSG) report. The Committee concluded that a review of the consumer protection role of the Financial Regulator should be commenced in three years time, as recommended by the CSG, (a period which corresponds to the first five years of its operation) and that all relevant stakeholders should be consulted as part of that review.  My Department is currently finalising arrangements to commence the review this year in line with the timeframe identified in the Committee&rsquo;s report. </P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that some recent authoritative reviews have commented favourably on the consumer protection role of the Financial Regulator.  For example the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Value for Money report on the Financial Regulator published in July 2007 stated that since the establishment of the Financial Regulator in 2003, the Financial Regulator had made significant progress in developing a programme of actions aimed at achieving greater protection for consumers of financial services.  The OECD Economic Survey of Ireland, published in April 2008, highlighted the introduction of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code (CPC), the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Minimum Competency Requirements for persons who provide advice on or sell retail financial products, and the recent extension of the CPC to sub-prime lenders.</P>

	<P>Section 473(6)(a)(i) Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 requires that a claim for rent relief is to be made in a form prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners.  The prescribed form is the Form Rent 1.  Section 473(6)(a)(i)(II) TCA 1997 states that the prescribed form signed by the claimant should contain the name, address and the tax reference number of the person entitled to the rent.  Section 473(6)(b) provides that failure of the claimant (i.e. the tenant) to supply certain information, including the landlord&rsquo;s tax reference number, shall be grounds for refusal of the rent relief.</P>
        <P>However,  Section 473(6)(b)(i) TCA 1997 provides that the Revenue Commissioners may waive the requirement for a tenant to provide his or her landlord&rsquo;s tax reference number on receipt of satisfactory proof that the tenant&rsquo;s inability to provide such information is bona fide.  On receipt of such satisfactory proof, the Revenue Commissioners will allow the rent relief.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, my officials can pass on relevant details to the Revenue Commissioners for examination or further examination, as the case may be.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 77 together.</P>
        <P>Ready, Steady Play: A National Play Policy, which was published in 2004, provides a framework for the development of public play facilities in Ireland with the overall aim of ensuring that children have access to a range of quality play opportunities to enrich their childhood. While the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has an overall role in supporting implementation of the Play Policy, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local <Col N="341"/>Government, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the HSE retain responsibility for implementation of actions falling within their remit.    Since the publication of the Play Policy, over &euro;28m has been allocated to the provision of play facilities  which  has resulted in the development of an additional 300 play facilities throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In addition to the development of these play facilities, up to &euro;1 million has been allocated, via  dormant accounts funding, for a Playbus Scheme.  This measure is intended to provide interventions that support the family unit, by providing play development and parenting development outreach services to children and their parents, experiencing social exclusion in disadvantaged and isolated areas.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Play Policy, Teenspace National Recreation Policy for Young People was launched in September 2007. The policy provides a strategic framework for the promotion of positive recreational opportunities aimed principally at young people aged 12 to 18.  The policy adopts an evidence-based approach and makes proposals to address issues which emerged from a public consultation process which was undertaken by my Office and was also informed through the findings of independent research commissioned by my Office. In particular, this included places for young people to hang out with their friends, such as youth caf&eacute;s. As the Deputy will be aware there are already a number of youth caf&eacute;s in operation around the country. Funding for these existing initiatives is provided through a number of bodies including local City/County Council and Health Service Executive. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs also operate a number of relevant funding programmes aimed at supporting community development, locally based community and voluntary groups as well as programmes aimed specifically at supporting projects for disadvantaged youth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At this stage, my focus is to bring better coherence to the approach taken to date, retaining the strong inter-agency element and identifying an appropriate model(s) for youth caf&eacute;s for future developments. Since September my office has undertaken a small survey of some of the existing caf&eacute;s looking at mission/objectives, management and organisation, service levels and the role of young people.  It also requested the National Children&rsquo;s Advisory Council&rsquo;s advice on the development of a youth caf&eacute; model and research work has been commissioned by the Council in this regard.  I am anticipating the Council will be in a position to report to me shortly.  This work will guide government in ensuring that funding is targeted and co-ordinated most effectively on a model or models of youth caf&eacute;s which meet the needs identified by young people themselves. Discussions are also under way with my Cabinet colleagues regarding a youth caf&eacute; programme and appropriate funding mechanisms. I am considering which agency could best lead on the programme and how to ensure any funding which might be made available augments, without displacing, the existing inter-agency resources.</P>

	<P>Persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services qualify for a medical card, which entitles them to a range of health services free of charge.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>In general, eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings). The main exception is persons aged 70 and over, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card. The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.  Under the assessment guidelines, persons whose weekly incomes are derived solely from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments and Health Service Executive (HSE) payments, even if these exceed the stated threshold, qualify for a medical card.</P>
        <P>As the HSE has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) which is the successor programme to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) which concluded at the end of 2007.  The NCIP  has been allocated &euro;575 million over 5 years, and is designed to deliver 50,000 additional child care places 10,000 of which will be for the 3 to 4 year old age group and 5,000 for school age children.  The Programme which is Exchequer funded aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care supports and services which are grounded in an understanding of local needs.</P>
        <P>Preliminary figures collated by Pobal indicate that, at the end of April this year, approximately 5,300 new pre-school places will be created under the NCIP capital funding committed to date.  This figure represents 53.2% of the overall target figure for the programme and based on the amount of capital grant aid approved to date is a clear indication that the programme is on course to achieve its target of 10,000 new places.  These places are in addition to almost 40,000 new child care places, of which a large number would be in the pre-school age cohort, that were delivered under the EOCP.</P>

	<P>The commitment to create 50,000 new child care places by 2010 is being delivered under the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), announced in Budget 2006.  This is a successor programme to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and is designed to build on the achievements of the EOCP and provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care supports and services, grounded in identified local needs.  Targets for the NCIP include the creation of an additional 10,000 new child care places for the 3 to 4 years age-group with an early childhood care and education focus and 5,000 places for children of school-age.</P>
        <P>The total allocation to the Programme is &euro;575m over five years, of which &euro;358m is in respect of capital expenditure and &euro;217m is in respect of current expenditure.  Up to the end of April 2008, capital grants totalling almost &euro;180m have been approved to child care providers under the NCIP.  These approvals are expected to lead to the creation of almost 24,000 new child care places.  These new places are in addition to the nearly 40,000 new child care places which were delivered under the EOCP.</P>

	<P>The commitment in the Programme for Government to which the Deputy refers is primarily a matter for the Department of Education and Science. That Department provides some pre-school provision for children with special educational needs through the visiting teacher service <Col N="345"/>and, more recently, through the expansion of the home tuition scheme to provide funding for home programmes for pre-school children on the autistic spectrum. In addition, the Department of Education and Science funds 24 early intervention classes for children with autism &mdash; these classes are attached to mainstream schools.  I understand that, under the Programme for Government, it is not envisaged that a formal network of pre-schools for children with disabilities will be established. Rather support will be provided, as necessary, to the parents and child with special educational needs.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP). The NCIP is the successor programme to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) which concluded at the end of 2007.  The NCIP has been allocated &euro;575 million over 5 years, and is designed to deliver 50,000 additional child care places with approximately 5,000 for school age child care.  The Programme which is Exchequer funded aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care supports and services which are grounded in an understanding of local needs.</P>
        <P>The NCIP focuses in particular on the provision of capital grant funding for community based and private child care providers.  At the end of April, &euro;180 million in capital funding has been approved under the programme and it is expected that approximately 24,000 new child care places, of which more than 3,000 will be school age child care places, will be created as a result of this investment.  Under the NCIP a new Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), to support community not-for-profit child care services with a focus on disadvantage, was introduced this year.  The CCSS  has been allocated &euro;154.2 million over the period up to the end of 2010 representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under this scheme, services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from the service. In turn, the subvention received by the service will be reflected in the reduced fees for parents qualifying under the scheme.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community child care services generally.  Services supported under the scheme will include those for school going children, including breakfast and homework clubs which are important elements in the development of high quality school age child care.</P>

	<P>The commitment to which the Deputy refers, concerning the provision of such services in schools, is a matter for the Department of Education and Science.  However, under the National Childcare Investment Programme, for which I have responsibility, capital grant funding is provided to develop child care services including services which cater for school age children, that is services which care for children  out of school hours.  This would normally consist of breakfast clubs, after school provision and child care during school holidays.  Community-based school aged child care facilities with a focus on disadvantage may also apply for support funding under the <Col N="346"/>Community Childcare Subvention Scheme which enables their services to provide reduced fees to qualifying parents.</P>
        <P>Under the Education system, the large majority of schools are run by independent Boards of Management, and it is a matter for them whether they decide to provide such a service. A number have applied for funding under the Programmes operated by my Office, and have received grant aid for such services.</P>

	<P>The National Economic Social Council, in its report, the &lsquo;Developmental Welfare State&rsquo;, introduced the lifecycle approach to social policy discourse in Ireland. This is a holistic approach that places the individual at the centre of policy development and service delivery, and which was adopted in the national partnership agreement Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>This new approach was adopted in the context of a growing body of international research which emphasises the importance of early interventions in securing better longer term outcomes for children.  For children disadvantaged by background or family circumstance especially, positive supports provided in the very first years positively impact life chances by promoting child emotional and physical development. Prevention and early intervention with children is likely to be most successful when nested within integrated supports for families &mdash; to provide parents experiencing difficulties with the personal resources and skills they need, and to foster positive family environments in which children can develop and achieve.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to improving the lives of our children, and to that end, a practical application of the lifecycle approach can be seen in the establishment of the Children&rsquo;s Services Committees (CSCs).  These committees are focused on using a streamlined, crosscutting approach to the design and delivery of services for children and their families across sectorial and agency boundaries.</P>
        <P>A National Children&rsquo;s Strategy Implementation Group (NCSIG), was established at the end of 2006 under Towards 2016 to support these developments.  The NCSIG approved the establishment of four initial multi-agency Children&rsquo;s Services Committees (CSCs) in the following areas: Donegal County Council, South Dublin County Council, Dublin City Council and Limerick City Council.  These CSCs are charged with progressing the implementation of strategic plans and policy documents already devised in relation to children&rsquo;s services in their respective areas.  The aim is to test models of best practice which promote integrated, locally led, strategic planning for children&rsquo;s services across agencies.  Each area is working towards the identification of shared priorities and, in time, an implementation plan for children&rsquo;s services in the area.  The view of the NCSIG is that the development of CSCs should be locally determined and led within a flexible framework devised and agreed at national level.</P>
        <P>A broad framework for the development of a work programme for the CSCs in the start-up stage has been agreed and is being implemented.  Technical assistance to support the change management process in delivering on this framework was commissioned and is currently being provided to the four sites based on their specific needs. Collaborative working, across all four CSCs, to assess progress, compare and assess practices will commence in mid 2008 as part of the change management process.  The timing of the establishment of further committees will be guided by the developments in these pioneer sites although the necessary development work to support &ldquo;readiness&rdquo; for the establishment of further committees in other areas is ongoing in <Col N="347"/>the interim.  In this regard the OMC is working with agencies at national level through the NCSIG and promising local initiatives to foster interagency relationship building and collaborative working.</P>

This funding included monies to provide new and enhanced services for people with disabilities, to implement Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, which came into effect on June 1st 2007 for the under 5&rsquo;s and also for the continuation of the implementation of the transfer of persons with intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.  The Government is also honouring its promise in relation to the Multi-annual Investment Programme for people with disabilities, with a further &euro;50m investment which was announced in the 2008 Budget.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s specific question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.

Prof. Keane and the HSE have emphasised that it is as much a matter of mobilising existing resources and redirecting them to achieve the National Cancer Control Programme objectives as providing extra resources.

	<P>The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) have announced a preferred bidder for the provision of laboratory testing services for the National Cervical Screening Programme. This is an important milestone which will enable the NCSS to launch the first quality assured, population based National Cervical Screening Programme for women in Ireland aged 25-60 years.</P>
        <P>The NCSS is a statutory agency and is entirely separate from the Health Service Executive (HSE). The HSE had no involvement in the process to select a preferred bidder to provide laboratory services for the National Cervical Screening Programme. In keeping with EU procurement legislation, the procurement process is being conducted in an open and competitive manner.  Submissions were invited from local and international laboratories during the process.  The NCSS has concluded that the preferred bidder can deliver a service that meets all of the required quality criteria. The Deputy will appreciate that quality is a critical requirement of the new programme in the context of patients&rsquo; best interests.  As the procurement process has not yet concluded, there are no details available on the cost of the service.</P>
        <P>The National Hospitals Office (NHO) of the HSE has a commitment to staff currently employed in cytology services, and has met with their representative.  Any decisions regarding reassignment of employees will be addressed after the National Cancer Screening Service has completed the procurement process for cytology services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006 &mdash; 2010 (NCIP) under which the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being implemented.</P>
        <P>The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their child care costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over &euro;500m in 2008.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of child care they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government child care policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</P>
        <P>The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme was introduced on 1st January 2008 with an allocation of &euro;154.2 million over 3 years.  The Scheme will continue to support community-based child care services to provide reduced child care fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Community child care services will qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The parent profile of each service, and the amount of subvention it will receive, are determined on the basis of completed parent declaration forms which they return as part of the application process.  The subvention received by services is, in turn, reflected in reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme provides an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community child care services generally.  The subvention to services is responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage and the ceiling for funding which existed under the previous scheme has been removed.  Account is also being taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones which, in some cases, were previously inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition, transitional arrangements have been put in place to facilitate community services which were funded under the previous scheme to adjust to the new arrangements, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  This will mean that community services which were funded under the previous scheme and which continue to operate, are guaranteed at least 95% of their 2007 grant aid in 2008.</P>
        <P>When the framework for the new scheme was announced in July of last year, my predecessor, Mr Brendan Smith T.D. signalled his intention to undertake a review of the Scheme on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which was to be forwarded to the Office of the Minister for Children in late 2007 as part of the application process of the new scheme.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the review was completed and the following adjustments were made to the scheme in December:</P><Col N="354"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the child care subvention rates, which form the basis for assessing the level of grant funding payable to community child care services, have been increased from &euro;80 to &euro;100 per week in the case of Band A parents and from &euro;30 to &euro;70 per week in the case of Band B parents;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />services will also be grant aided to enable them to provide reduced child care fees for parents in Band C who are marginally above the Family Income Supplement (FIS) threshold and low income parents who qualify under this measure will benefit by &euro;45 per week per full-time place;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />where a parent moves to a lower Band (e.g. from social welfare into employment), the subvention paid in respect of them will be withdrawn on a tapered basis with the effect that where a parent would no longer qualify for a Band A payment, he or she will be treated as a Band B parent in the following year;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />special provisions will be provided for in the case of child care services where, for valid reasons, it is not possible to assess grant funding on the basis of annual parental declarations alone (e.g. women&rsquo;s refuges, special services for children of drug misusers) and, in exceptional cases, where special levels of funding provision may be required;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />in recognition of the on-going input of the community and voluntary sector, and to provide stability for services which would otherwise receive very low levels of grant subvention (e.g. small rural services) a minimum grant level of &euro;20,000 per annum has been introduced, provided services meet the conditions of the scheme in full.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.2- ?>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As a transitional measure during 2008-2010, services which could otherwise face a significant decrease in their existing level of grant support from July 2008, will continue to receive grant aid equal to not less than 90% of their previous grant level during July-December 2008, equal to not less than 85% of that amount in 2009, and equal to not less than 75% of that amount in 2010.  The transitional grant funding is conditional on all requirements of the Scheme being complied with, including the return of annual applications together with completed parent declaration forms and the implementation of tiered fees based on the subvention levels for Band A, B and C parents.</P>
        <P>The changes which have been introduced will ensure that the most affordable child care is available to families according to their means.  Put simply, the tiered fee structure is the most effective way of ensuring that the considerable and ongoing Government support for the community child care sector, will be targeted at those who need it most.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that, with an allocation of &euro;154.2 million over a 3 year period for the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme, the Government is continuing to offer very generous support to this important sector of Ireland&rsquo;s child care infrastructure. Given the cost of the previous staffing Scheme was &euro;37 million in 2007, this represents a very significant increase in resources to support the Community Childcare sector.</P>

	<P>Following the launch of the campaign to recruit a Rapid Response Corps in February, 2007, 52 volunteers were recruited, and completed their pre-deployment training and preparations during 2007.  A second campaign to recruit members to the Rapid Response Corps began on 14 February, 2008. This campaign focused mainly on the logistics, engineering and humanitarian skills most in demand by our stand-by partners. However, new public health, protection and education profiles were added at the request of those partners.</P>
        <P>From this campaign a further 36 volunteers were invited to join the Corps. A group of 24 completed the compulsory pre-departure training course from 7-14 May and have begun the necessary medical preparations. This will bring the number of Corps members ready to deploy if requested to 76. A further pre-departure training course is scheduled for early October, 2008.  In building the capacity of the Corps, Irish Aid has facilitated the attendance by 24 members of the Corps on training courses designed and delivered by our humanitarian partners. This is a policy which will be actively pursued in the future. In addition, Irish Aid arranges separate workshops for Rapid Response Corps members on topics of relevance for humanitarian response.  To date, there have been 12 deployments of the Corps, the most recent in early May to Darfur, Sudan. Other Corps members have been deployed to Sri Lanka, Somalia, Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nepal and Ethiopia.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid entered into a Letter of Agreement with the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in October, 2006. Under this agreement, the WFP was tasked with the set up, procurement, management and transportation to the field of Ireland&rsquo;s stocks of essential humanitarian supplies. By mid 2007, essential non-food supplies &mdash; blankets, tents, jerry cans, water tanks, kitchen sets, etc &mdash; were pre-positioned at the central UN Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) in Brindisi, Italy and at a smaller facility provided by the Defence Forces at the Curragh Camp.</P>
        <P>In 2007, disbursals involving Irish supplies were made to emergencies in Sudan, Peru, Pakistan, Mali, Uganda and Burkina Faso. Already in 2008, there has been a significant increase in the rate of uptake of our stocks, with emergency shipments to Mozambique, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and, most recently, Burma/Myanmar. An airlift to China will take place within the next few days and a large shipment to Iraq is at the planning stage. All these stocks will be replenished.  Further increases in the level of humanitarian supplies will be made <Col N="358"/>possible when the new central UNHRD in Dubai becomes fully operational. We plan in due course to move our supplies to the new Depot. This will enable more rapid and effective disbursal of stocks, particularly to emergencies in South East Asia, the Middle East, and North and East Africa.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the 2006 Letter of Agreement with the WFP, Irish Aid makes an annual contribution of &euro;400,000 towards the annual operating costs of the UNHRD hub for Africa based in Accra. Up to now, this hub has been housed in temporary premises. In 2008, Irish Aid made an additional contribution to the WFP of &euro;600,000 towards the construction of a new facility which is now expected to be completed by the end of 2008. When completed, we will pre-position additional supplies at this Depot, enabling faster delivery of supplies within Africa.</P>

	<P>The programme for Government envisages an increase in funding for Ireland&rsquo;s response to humanitarian emergencies in the amount &euro;40 million during the lifetime of the Government. Funding for humanitarian emergencies arises from a number of budgetary headings in Irish Aid, though the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund (EHAF) is Irish Aid&rsquo;s primary source of such funding.  In 2007, in response to the increasing number and severity of humanitarian emergencies, the allocation was increased by 50% from &euro;60 million to &euro;90 million. This substantial increase approved in 2007 clearly signals the Government&rsquo;s commitment towards increasing Ireland&rsquo;s response to humanitarian emergencies and is fully in line with the undertakings contained in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>Ireland was one of the driving forces behind the introduction of the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and remains one of its strongest supporters. The CERF enables the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) to respond immediately to any sudden on-set emergency. In 2007 we doubled our contribution to the CERF from &euro;10 million to &euro;20 million making Ireland the sixth largest donor to the CERF. In 2008, we further increased our contribution by a further 13% to &euro;22.6 million. This brings Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution to the CERF since its inception to &euro;52.6 million. This is fully in line with the undertakings contained in the programme for Government.</P>

	<P>An important element of the Government&rsquo;s Rapid Response Initiative is a commitment to provide funding to our Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO), Red Cross and UN partners to assist them in enhancing their capacity to respond to international emergencies.  To that end, over &euro;4.75 million has been provided since 2007 to our main international and national partners to help them build their organisational capacity to respond to and prepare for humanitarian emerg<Col N="359"/>encies. Of that amount, almost &euro;1.1 million has been provided to Irish NGOs primarily for humanitarian staff development and training purposes.</P>
        <P>An initiative was also implemented in 2007 on a two year pilot basis to assist our main NGO partners respond more rapidly to international emergencies. The initiative provides each of our three main NGO partners &mdash; Concern, Tr&oacute;caire and Goal &mdash; with their own rapid response fund which they can immediately access following an emergency. This major rapid response initiative will be evaluated in 2009.</P>

	<P>Recent data released by the United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) show that the global HIV prevalence &mdash; the number of people living with HIV &mdash; has levelled off and that the number of new infections has fallen. This is primarily due to much improved surveillance methodologies along with some positive impacts of HIV programmes.  However, in 2007 over 33 million people were living with HIV, 2.5 million became newly infected and over 2 million people died of AIDS related illnesses. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the most severely affected region in the world and is home to over 22 million people living with HIV or 68% of the global total. AIDS remains the primary cause of death in Africa.</P>
        <P>Responding to the global problem of HIV and AIDS is a key priority for the Government as clearly stated in the Programme for Government. The former Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment to spend &euro;100 million per year on addressing HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases has been reached and expenditure is now in excess of &euro;100 million. Ireland now leads the way within the European Union in terms of the proportion of its overseas development assistance <Col N="360"/>allocated to HIV and other diseases of poverty. This funding is saving lives through advocacy, education, treatment and assisting those living with HIV and AIDS.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s assistance is directed at programmes at country, regional and international levels and is ensuring that increasing numbers of people are accessing quality HIV and AIDS and other health services. Most of Ireland&rsquo;s assistance is targeted at those countries most affected by the pandemic including Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zambia and Malawi. Ireland continues to promote the need for leadership and engagement at the highest political level internationally, in order to reverse the trend of this pandemic. Ireland is, in many ways, leading by example.</P>
        <P>Ireland is, for instance, the first country to sign a three year agreement with the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. Signed in April, this agreement will see Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Fund reaching &euro;90 million over the next three years. Almost 60% of Global Fund resources are allocated to sub-Saharan Africa and to date it is estimated that the Fund has saved over 1.8 million lives.  In partnership with the Clinton Foundation Ireland has increased its funding to the Governments of Mozambique and Lesotho to improve the accessibility of HIV treatment in rural areas and in particular to women and children. In Mozambique, over 78,000 people are now on HIV treatment, up from less than 2,000 people at the end of 2002. In Lesotho, following one year of operation, 4 health facilities have been refurbished and over 2,500 people are accessing HIV treatment including 100 children.  Ireland has prioritised the needs of children in its work on HIV and AIDS. It is the only country to target 20% of its increased funding to interventions that will benefit children.</P>
        <P>In recognition of Ireland&rsquo;s leadership in this area, we have been requested to host the fourth Global Partners Forum on Children affected by HIV and AIDS. Working in cooperation with UNICEF and scheduled for October, this forum will bring together high level decision makers from both developed and developing countries to debate the best approaches to ensuring the protection of children living in a world with HIV and AIDS.  The Government is committed to continuing its work to address HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases and to ensuring that men, women and children get access to quality health and HIV services.</P>

	<P>Irish Aid provides support, through the Civil Society Fund and Micro Projects Scheme, to over 160 organisations, including academic institutions, community groups and volunteer based organisations as well as professionally staffed non-governmental organisations. The Civil Society Fund has co-funded development interventions from many sectors of Irish society including applications from the legal, medical, construction and information technology areas. In addition the Micro-Projects Scheme, established in 2006, supports the development activities of smaller Irish organisations. This scheme was established in recognition of the great interest that exists amongst individuals, organisations and communities in Ireland who want to make their own contribution to development.</P>
        <P>The Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre which was opened by the former Taoiseach in January provides information and guidance on all aspects of the Irish Aid programme. In particular, it works to raise awareness of how individuals and organisations can volunteer and get involved in development work. To date, the Centre has facilitated over <Col N="361"/>seventy five meetings and events on development related issues, held seven temporary exhibitions and hosted over sixty five schools groups involving 1,200 pupils. About 700 visitors use the Centre each week.</P>
        <P>A programme of Strategic Cooperation between Irish Aid and Higher Education Research Institutions was launched in 2006. The overall aim is to support Irish Aid&rsquo;s policy objectives in reducing poverty through collaborative research and academic exchange programmes initiated by Irish third level institutions. The Programme ultimately aims to promote capacity building in higher education and research institutions in developing countries. The thematic areas that activities focus on include health, HIV and AIDS, infectious diseases, education, food and livelihood security, pro-poor economic growth, governance and gender equality. The programme is managed by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on behalf of Irish Aid.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Irish Aid strongly affirms that Africa will remain the principal focus of Ireland&rsquo;s official aid programme in the years ahead. It is in Africa that progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals is slowest. The majority of the 50 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are located in Africa. Approximately 80% of Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Development Assistance goes to Africa. It is by continuing to focus on that continent that Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance can best respond to the needs of the world&rsquo;s poorest people and make a real difference in their lives.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Irish Aid and the Programme for Government include a commitment to support regional development programmes to address issues which do not respect national borders. A number of programmes are now funded which have a regional focus, particularly in the humanitarian area, including food security and HIV/AIDS. It is intended that an enhanced regional programme will be developed in the next 2 years and a small task team has been established to progress this objective, including the placement of a senior official in Africa to drive this forward.</P>

	<P>Irish Aid is committed to supporting civil society organisations as partners in the attainment of the Millennium Declaration and associated goals to reduce global poverty.  Irish Aid currently provides development funding to NGOs through a number of schemes in support of their work in developing countries. The Multi-annual Programmes Scheme (MAPS) and Civil Society Fund (CSF) are the main conduits for Irish civil society organisations to access Irish Aid funding for overseas development work. Irish Aid also supports the work of missionaries through the Irish Missionary Resource Service (IMRS).</P>
        <P>In 2008 &euro;139 million will be disbursed by Civil Society Section to NGOs and missionary organisations in support of their work in developing countries, compared to &euro;121 million in 2007. Additional funding is being delivered through other mechanisms.   MAPS is an innovative multi-annual programme scheme introduced in 2003 which aims to provide predictable long <Col N="362"/>term funding for five key NGO partners. To be eligible for MAPS, some of the key criteria are previous significant experience and relationship with Irish Aid over a 5 year time frame; the capacity to raise up to 30% of total income from voluntary funds raised in Ireland; the capacity and scale to work programmatically and coherence with MAPS objectives.</P>
        <P>Five year multi-annual agreements to provide predictable budgetary support have been agreed with Christian Aid, Concern, GOAL and Tr&oacute;caire for the period 2007-2011. Discussions on the completion of a multi-annual agreement with Self Help Development International (SHDI) are ongoing. In line with the commitment under the Programme for Government, Irish Aid has commenced the process of assessing three potential new NGO partners for inclusion in the MAPS scheme.  As recently as 2006, the new Civil Society Fund was introduced which significantly rationalised the previous range of funding schemes. The Civil Society Fund, which features a streamlined application and appraisal process, is designed to provide resources more effectively and efficiently for the development activities of civil society organisations. Since its establishment, over &euro;100 million has been allocated under the CSF to fund development interventions by NGOs.</P>
        <P>In addition, the CSF also provides that on the basis of a successful track record of previous implementation, successful organisations may be invited by Irish Aid to apply for a multi-annual block grant. This allows for a more programmatic approach by the organisation with administrative gains, security of funding for the period and increased autonomy. Irish Aid also established, in 2006, the Micro-Projects Scheme to support the development activities of smaller Irish organisations. This scheme was established in recognition of the great interest that exists among organisations and communities in Ireland which want to make their own contribution to development. The maximum grant is &euro;20,000.</P>

	<P>The commitment in the Programme for Government 2007-2012 to which the Deputy refers has been brought to the attention of purchasers in all Government Departments and public bodies via the e-procurement network maintained by the Department of Finance, and information on the initiative is available on the Government&rsquo;s procurement portal website at www.etenders.gov.ie.  The response to this and other initiatives to promote the purchase of Fair Trade products has been encouraging, and I understand that sales in Ireland continue to grow. The Deputy will be pleased to note that my own Department provides, where practicable, Fair Trade products to service meetings and receptions in Iveagh House. Specific guidance on sourcing of Fair Trade products has been issued to the Department&rsquo;s Business Units at headquarters and to Missions abroad.</P>
        <P>I should mention also that the Government&rsquo;s programme of assistance to developing countries, Irish Aid, continues to support the Fair Trade movement internationally and in Ireland. This support includes funding from the Development Education Funding Scheme which goes to increase public awareness through educational materials and events including Fairtrade Fortnight and Fairtrade Towns. Several local authorities and public bodies have participated in these initiatives, including Dublin City Council which received the award of &ldquo;Fairtrade Capital City&rdquo; status from Fairtrade Ireland in February of this year.  My Department will continue its efforts to encourage Government Departments and public sector bodies generally to source fair trade products where it is practicable to do so and where it is consistent with their obligations under EU and national public procurement rules.</P>

	<P>A commitment was made in the Programme for Government to &lsquo;Adopt an integrated approach to development across all Departments&rsquo;. The 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid included a further commitment to establish a new Inter-Departmental Committee on Development to strengthen coherence in the Government&rsquo;s approach to development and to make best use of the expertise and skills available across the public service.  I am pleased to say that, in line with these commitments, an Inter-Departmental Committee on Development, chaired by the Minister for Overseas Development, was established. The Committee aims to strengthen coherence in development policy across Government Departments. Development cooperation does not take place in isolation from other Government policies and the need for greater coherence in policies across sectors that affect developing countries is fully recognised.</P>
        <P>Positive progress has been made. Two sub groups of the Committee have been established, one to look at developing a more coherent policy in our relationships with multilateral organisations and the second focusing on making best use of the expertise and skills available across the public service in our development aid programme. The Committee will report annually to the Minister for Foreign Affairs outlining its activities and making recommendations as appropriate.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 to 122, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government proposed the development of an Irish Academic Centre for Conflict Resolution to provide academic and analytical expertise in this area, and to act as a resource for my Department&rsquo;s Conflict Resolution Unit. The development of the Centre will help to deliver on the Conflict Resolution Unit&rsquo;s mandate to work with academic institutions, civil society organisations and other partners. The Unit has engaged in a detailed study of comparable academic centres abroad, in order to identify best practice in this area and design a model for the centre that is well suited to Ireland&rsquo;s needs and resources.  My predecessor, Minister Dermot Ahern TD, wrote to Irish academic institutions on 31 March advising them of the intended establishment of the Centre and inviting them to nominate representatives to participate in a consultative process leading to the establishment of the Centre. These consultations will take account of ongoing work in the conflict resolution area and, in particular, of the Government&rsquo;s objectives.</P>
        <P>As regards the Stability Fund, the amount available has been increased this year from &euro;4.5 million to &euro;10 million, with &euro;5.5 million of this dedicated to support specific initiatives related to the work of the Conflict Resolution Unit. As the work of the Unit develops opportunities to support effective conflict resolution activities will increase. Regarding the establishment of a system of Roving Ambassadors, Minister Ahern announced during his address to the National Parliament of Timor-Leste in Dili in late February that he had appointed Nuala O&rsquo;Loan to be the first such Roving Ambassador, with the role of Special Envoy for Conflict Resolution in Timor-Leste. Ms O&rsquo;Loan has recently returned from a visit to Timor-Leste, where she met President Jos&eacute; Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao, as well as other representatives of government, the United Nations, bilateral donors and political and civil society organisations. Mrs O&rsquo;Loan will in due course report back to me and advise on specific initiatives which can be taken to assist in conflict resolution and peacebuilding activities there.</P>
        <P>On the fourth-level scholarships, a scheme of doctoral scholarships in conflict resolution was established by my Department earlier this year in partnership with the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences. Applications for scholarships under the scheme were assessed by an international panel of academics, assembled by the Research Council, and led by an expert in the area of conflict resolution. Three scholarships, supporting research towards Ph.D. degrees focusing on themes relevant to the work of the Conflict Resolution Unit, are to <Col N="365"/>be offered in this inaugural year of the scheme, and the successful candidates will be notified shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Reaching out to and strengthening links with the Irish community in Britain and with those of Irish ancestry has been, and continues to be, a cornerstone of Government policy.  This commitment is reflected in the unprecedented level of funding secured for emigrant services in recent years. Since the establishment of the Irish Abroad Unit in 2004, the range and extent of the Emigrant Support Programme has been considerably expanded. This year the Government has made &euro;15.183 million available for emigrant services. This figure is three times greater than the 2004 allocation, and is a clear reflection of our firm and ongoing commitment to the welfare of Irish people abroad.</P>
        <P>The capacity of the Irish Abroad Unit and that of our network of Missions which support and coordinate the Programme has also increased. This ensures that these additional resources continue to be allocated and monitored efficiently. This was confirmed by a Value for Money and Policy Review of the Support for Emigrants Subhead which was completed in July 2007 by Goodbody Economic Consultants &mdash; copies of the Review were lodged in the Houses of the Oireachtas Library and are also on the Departmental website (www.dfa.ie ).  The Government is committed to incrementally increasing funding levels to groups working with our emigrant communities, subject to overall budgetary considerations.</P>

	<P>The extension of RT&Eacute; and TG4 television programming to the Irish community in Britain has been a long-standing and key objective of the Government.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, following a series of meetings between the Irish Abroad Unit, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and RT&Eacute;, my colleague Eamon Ryan TD, Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, announced in March that RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s international service is scheduled to be on air in Britain by March 2009.  Advances in satellite technology have facilitated the achievement of this goal. This new service will be provided through a digital satellite TV service called Freesat. Freesat was launched by the BBC and ITV earlier this month and is available without subscription to almost every household across Britain and Northern Ireland. The Freesat package offers a range of services not available on other systems, including High Digital programming, and access to more than 180 TV channels.</P>
        <P>The only cost in accessing Freesat is a once-off payment of approximately &euro;200 for a digital box and satellite dish. The service is totally free thereafter. I would intend, through the Irish Abroad Unit, to assist those less well-off and vulnerable Irish emigrants who may have difficulty in meeting the initial cost of the satellite dish and decoder required to access Freesat.  The precise content to be broadcast on this new international service is currently being considered by RT&Eacute;. We know, however, the service will provide some of the programmes most <Col N="366"/>sought by the Irish in Britain, including news and current affairs, and most of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s indigenously produced programming. Current contractual arrangements in most cases, however, will preclude the transmission of sports events and acquired programming.</P>
        <P>This new international service will provide the Irish abroad with a valuable link to home. I believe it will be particularly welcomed by the more elderly and isolated members of our community in Britain, a group whose welfare has always been central to the Emigrant Support Programme.</P>

	<P>The Government continues to be fully committed to extending the free public transport scheme to Irish emigrants of pensionable age when visiting Ireland.  The most recent development in this regard is that the Department&rsquo;s Irish Abroad Unit, working closely with our network of Missions in EU Capitals, has researched the type of provisions made in other EU countries to subsidise pensioners&rsquo; travel, and the extent to which any such subsidies extend to all or some EU nationals.</P>
        <P>The Unit has been able to confirm that certain, albeit limited, precedent exists for the provision of domestic free or subsidised travel schemes to all EU nationals of pensionable age in several EU Countries. Exceptionally, Hungary is alone amongst EU States in providing unrestricted free travel to all nationals of pensionable age, irrespective of their place of residence.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs have been made aware of these findings, and are set to consider the information in greater depth, in coordination with this Department.</P>

	<P>Directive 2005/32/EC, which establishes a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-using products, and proposals on individual products arising under the Framework Directive, fall within the aegis of my Department. The Department deals with proposals in conjunction with an Inter-Departmental/Inter-Agency Group including representatives from the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Enterprise Ireland and Sustainable Energy Ireland.  The European Commission has split work on domestic lighting into two strands, Domestic Lighting part 1 including incandescent bulbs, and Domestic Lighting part 2 on directional light sources. The Study on part 1 has been carried out and on part 2 it is still under way.</P>
        <P>Ireland has not made a written submission on the studies on domestic lighting. However, at a recent Consultation Forum meeting chaired by the Commission we expressed support in principle for the application of ecodesign requirements in relation to part 1, and looked forward to receiving an early proposal from the Commission.  As with all proposals being developed under the Directive, the Commission proposal on domestic lighting part 1 is being prepared in <Col N="367"/>a three-stage process. Firstly, a detailed technical study on the issue has been prepared for the Commission, in a process that was open for inputs by Stakeholders. Secondly, a more summary Commission Working Paper on the issue was submitted for views to a Consultation Forum of representatives of Stakeholders, including industry bodies, environmental protection groups and Member States.</P>
        <P>The Commission is now preparing the third stage of the process in this case, in which it is expected to submit a draft proposal on domestic lighting part 1, setting out proposed ecodesign requirements and a timetable for their application to such products on the EU market, to a Regulatory Committee for opinion. Proposals receiving a favourable opinion are then adopted by the Commission. A Commission proposal on domestic lighting part 1 is expected to come before the Regulatory Committee later this year. A separate implementing measure is expected to be proposed on part 2 at a later date.</P>

	<P>The Consumer Protection Act 2007 empowers the National Consumer Agency to prepare and publish Guidelines to traders in relation to matters of consumer welfare and protection and matters related to commercial practices.  The Act also entitles the Agency to review or approve Codes of Practice voluntarily submitted to it by traders or their trade associations where the Agency <Col N="368"/>is satisfied that the Code of Practice protects consumer interests and is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act or any other enactment.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the National Consumer Agency is currently discussing the development of possible Codes of Practice with a number of businesses and their representative bodies.  The Agency is also preparing Guidelines to businesses in two specific areas namely, the Retail Sector and the Health and Fitness Sector.  I understand that once it has concluded its consultations in relation to these matters, the Agency hopes to publish its final Guidelines to these sectors as soon as possible thereafter.  I recognise the important part that codes of practice can play in protecting the rights of consumers and in ensuring consistent, high quality goods and services and very much welcome the positive approach of the National Consumer Agency in working with traders and their representative associations to develop a strong consumer culture amongst Irish business.  I am confident that the development and promotion of such a culture through the initiatives embarked upon by the Agency will benefit not only consumers but businesses and the economy as a whole.</P>

	<P>Enterprise Ireland has primary responsibility for Irish companies in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors. It supports companies employing 10 or more people and start-up companies which have the potential to employ 10 or more people and reach or exceed &euro;1m in exports over three years.  The flow of innovative start-ups into the Irish economy is critical for future growth. High growth potential start-ups that can develop innovative products and services, underpinned by the imaginative use of technology, will be significant drivers in Ireland&rsquo;s continued economic success.</P>
        <P>Encouraging and supporting these innovation-led high potential start-up companies (HPSUs) with an export focus is a key priority for Enterprise Ireland and is fundamental to building the next generation of world-class Irish companies. Enterprise Ireland offers a wide range of services, including financial and non-financial supports to companies with a business strategy that encompasses all elements required for business success.  For example, Enterprise Ireland provides the &ldquo;Innovative HPSU offer&rdquo; to support the development of start-ups with a high potential for growth. Under this programme, Enterprise Ireland provides a financial contribution towards a Company&rsquo;s business plan where it involves the development of innovative and technological products, services or processes.</P>
        <P>Other initiatives include the Enterprise Start Programme, which was developed by Enterprise Ireland and F&Aacute;S to help potential entrepreneurs to develop their new business ideas into business plans. The programme is aimed at individuals with new business ideas in technology or knowledge intensive sectors that are capable of achieving export sales. Participants have the opportunity of presenting their business plans to representatives of Enterprise Ireland, F&Aacute;S and the County Enterprise Boards.  This gives the entrepreneurs a unique opportunity to receive immediate feedback, support and advice on how to further their business idea.  Participants who complete a business plan can also avail of one-to-one mentoring as well as receiving a Certificate from the Institute of Leadership Management.</P><Col N="369"/>
        <P>Another incentive available is the Enterprise Platform Programme, a one-year rapid incubation programme designed to provide hands-on support and management development for entrepreneurs who wish to start their own business.  Small service companies may qualify for seed and venture capital funding. A dynamic and healthy venture capital market is a prerequisite for the growth and development of high potential start-up companies in Ireland. Enterprise Ireland has focused on stimulating seed and venture capital funds in order to promote the availability of this important source of funding. Under the 2007&ndash;2012 Seed and Venture Capital Programme Enterprise Ireland is investing &euro;175 million in a new round of venture capital funding.</P>
        <P>The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards provide a source of support to small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants.  In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports such as business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, mentoring initiatives and targeted promotion activities to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises. These supports are designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.  I am satisfied that the above programmes and supports, along with a wide range of other initiatives, will assist small service companies to start-up, grow and adapt in today&rsquo;s economic climate.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that since the beginning of the year there have been significant increases in both the wholesale and retail price of petrol and diesel products, caused by a combination of strong demand, tight capacities and some market speculation.  Ireland has no control over world oil prices.  Government policy in relation to prices, including the price of commodities such as petrol and diesel, is concentrated on the promotion of competition, consumer choice and awareness.  There is no price control on these products and in common with most other goods and services price differences are an ongoing feature of the market economy.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for retailers to explain price differences where they occur and my Department encourages consumers to raise price concerns directly with retailers.  The Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order, 1997 requires petrol stations to display their prices in a clear and prominent manner so that consumers can make an informed choice.  The Order enables consumers to readily compare prices and purchase their fuel on the basis of an informed choice. The National Consumer Agency (NCA) enforces this Order.   Any infringements should be reported to the NCA.</P>
        <P>It is important, therefore, particularly in times of rising oil prices, that consumers inform themselves of the prices being charged by different traders for fuel products such as diesel and <Col N="370"/>petrol so that they can achieve the best value for their money. I am satisfied that the statutory Regulations in this area ensure that consumers are given the necessary price information to allow them to make informed choices when purchasing fuel.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of concerns expressed that some multi-national retailers are charging higher prices for food products in Ireland than in the UK.  Whilst undoubtedly rising food prices are being experienced across the world, the findings of recent surveys showing that the cost of certain food items to Irish consumers is significantly greater than the cost of such items to UK consumers are certainly matters of concern. A major factor in this debate relates to concerns that some retailers may not be passing on the benefits of the appreciation of the Euro&rsquo;s value vis a vis sterling to Irish consumers.</P>
        <P>The National Consumer Agency has raised this issue in bilateral discussions with retailers. In the course of those discussions, retailers have advised that the benefits of recent exchange rate movements may not be fully reflected in their prices for a variety of reasons including hedging arrangements and invoicing by UK suppliers in euro.  Nevertheless, the Agency is firmly of the view that the benefits of the Euro&rsquo;s appreciation should be passed on to consumers. The Agency is also of the view that, in some instances, the price charged by retailers reflects a price level that the retailer anticipates the Irish market will bear irrespective of exchange rate movements.  I fully share the Agency&rsquo;s view that consumers are entitled to expect a fair deal from business and that business has an obligation to treat their customers fairly which includes passing on the benefits of exchange rate movements and not seeking to profiteer from such movements.</P>
        <P>I met yesterday with the Chief Executive of the National Consumer Agency. The Chief Executive advised me that the Agency has initiated a series of actions to pursue this matter with the retail sector. It is vitally important that disproportionate price differentials on basic items such as food should be tackled and where retailers fail to provide credible reasons for such differentials their failure should be put under the spotlight. I fully support the initiatives being undertaken by the Agency.</P>

        <P>Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Applications for funding under the 2008 programme were invited through advertisements in the Press on 13th and 14th of January and the deadline for receipt of applications was 29th February for paper-based applications and 7th March for on-line applications.  All applications received before the deadline, including those from the organisations in question, are currently being evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.  I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

        <P>The Programme for Government 2007-2012 is a five-year programme and it is my intention to give effect to the commitments in the Programme relating to arts, culture and film over the lifetime of the Government.  Significant progress has been achieved to date on a range of the issues raised by the Deputy, as will be seen from the Department&rsquo;s recently published Arts and Culture Plan 2008, copies of which have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  In responding to the many questions posed of me in the House on 13th May last, I touched on progress on many of the arts, culture and film commitments in the programme for Government, and updated Deputies on them.  I look forward to addressing all of the arts, culture and film measures as they are progressed over coming months in consultation with the relevant stakeholders.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158, 161, 163 to 166, inclusive, and 168 to 171, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Department is making good progress in implementing the commitments contained in the Agreed Programme for Government 2007-2012.  It is my intention that the Programme will be delivered over a five year period and the commitments will be delivered in that context.  In <Col N="375"/>facilitating the Sports Capital Programme, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  The 2008 Programme was advertised on 13th and 14th of January and the deadline for receipt of applications was 29th February for paper-based applications and 7th March for on-line applications.  For the 2008 Sports Capital Programme the Department has introduced  a number of changes to implement key commitments contained in the Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The level of own funding required from applicants in urban disadvantaged areas has been reduced from 20% to 10%.  This covers applicants from RAPID and Local Drugs Task Force areas.  This change is in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas.  When completed, the National Sports Facility Strategy and the National Sports Facility Audit which is currently under way will further help to direct the provision of facilities to areas most in need of funding and facilities.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government also contains important commitments to promote greater sharing of sports facilities between schools and local sports clubs.  Under the 2008 Sports Capital Programme, schools making joint applications with local sports clubs are required to provide evidence of formal agreements with local clubs that guarantees the clubs access to school facilities for at least 30 hours per week throughout the year.  In assessing applications, extra marks are also awarded to sports clubs that can show that they are allowing local schools to use their facilities.  I intend to discuss with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, how his programme for the provision of sports halls in schools and the Sports Capital Programme might be dovetailed to provide greater value for money and enhanced facilities both for schools and the local community users.</P>
        <P>In relation to the roll out of the Local Sports Partnership network there are currently 29 LSPs fully operational, with coordinators in place, and the remaining four sites are finalising recruitment arrangements.  All 33 LSPs should be fully operational by July 2008.  Finally, the Women in Sport programme has received significant Government funding since it was launched in 2005.  Through the Women in Sport programme, this Government supports the work of the Irish Sports Council in encouraging women &mdash; young and old alike &mdash; to become involved in sport as participants, players, officials and administrators.  It is my intention to launch the National Volunteer in Sport Awards Programme later this year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 160 together.</P>
        <P>The nationwide audit of sports facilities has commenced and is being carried out in stages to help speed up the availability of information.  Phase one, which focuses on national and regional sports facilities, has now been completed within my Department.  Phase two of the audit, which is a more complex undertaking to establish a record of existing sports facilities at local level and identifying the need for future provision, will be undertaken during 2008 with the assistance <Col N="376"/>of Local Authorities.  Guidelines have now been issued to Local Authorities to assist them in carrying out the audit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The audit is part of a wider exercise to put in place a more strategic approach to the provision of sports facilities in Ireland.  Work on the National Sports Facility Strategy is currently under way in my Department.  An inter-agency steering group was established to oversee the development of the strategy and consultants, involving both national and international experts in the area of sports facilities, were engaged to assist in the preparation of the strategy.  The consultants' report is being finalised at present and will then be appraised by the steering group.</P>
        <P>The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment/grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  It is intended to identify the facilities requirement for sport so that participation at reasonable cost is feasible for those who wish to engage in sport at either amateur or elite level.</P>

	<P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means-tested.  This ensures scarce resources are directed at those in greatest need.  The carer&rsquo;s allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes.  It has been significantly eased over the years, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Increases to the carer&rsquo;s allowance income disregard, provided for in Budget 2008, mean that from April 2008, a single person can have an income of &euro;332.50 per week and a couple can have an income of up to &euro;665 per week and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance (the previous levels were &euro;320 and &euro;640 per week respectively).  This ensures that a couple can have an income in the region of &euro;37,200 per year and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package and the respite care grant.  This increase surpasses the &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; commitment of ensuring that those on average earnings can qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that the cost of doubling the threshold for the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance would be in the region of &euro;100 million and that eliminating the means test for the scheme entirely would cost in the region of &euro;150 million per year.  Budget 2007 provided for new arrangements whereby people can receive a maximum payment equivalent to a half rate carers allowance while receiving another social welfare payment, other than jobseekers benefit or allowance.  In June 2006 the number of hours for which a person can engage in employment, self-employment, education or training and still be considered to be providing full time care for the purposes of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  A carer who is caring for two or more people is entitled to a full grant for each of the care recipients.  The rate of the grant will increase to &euro;1,700 per year from June 2008.</P>
        <P>Carer&rsquo;s benefit is specifically intended to support people who leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention.  Budget 2006 extended the duration of carer&rsquo;s benefit from 15 to 24 months.  The associated carer&rsquo;s leave scheme which allows for the protection of the carer&rsquo;s employment rights for the duration of the caring period was similarly extended in 2006.  The carer&rsquo;s leave scheme is the responsibility of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is estimated that extending the duration of the carer&rsquo;s benefit scheme from 2 to 4 years would cost in the region of &euro;20 million per year.  However, this would depend on scheme take-up which is difficult to estimate.  In this regard, employers have noted that they would experience difficulties in preserving employees&rsquo; rights for more than 2 years.  If the need for income support still exists after carer&rsquo;s benefit has expired, the carer may apply for carer&rsquo;s allowance. <Col N="379"/> I will keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments on income support are delivered.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government commits the provision of a dedicated fund of at least &euro;100 million for investment in school sports facilities over five years from within the NDP allocation for school buildings.  I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to promoting exercise for our children and young people &mdash; both in their community and at school.  Over &euro;2.6 billion has been provided for school building infrastructure between 2000 and 2006 and a further &euro;4.5 billion is to be invested under the new National Development Plan 2007-2013.  Close to &euro;600m of this will be provided this year alone. In a new school building or refurbishment/extension PE facilities are included as an intrinsic part of the design.</P>
        <P>At primary level, Physical Education is one of the seven curriculum areas and is an intrinsic element of the Primary School Curriculum.  A revised curriculum in physical education at primary level was introduced in September 2005 supported by a national programme of professional development for teachers.  The programme provides for six strands of activity &mdash; athletics, dance, gymnastics, games, outdoor and adventure activities and aquatics.  All qualified Primary teachers are qualified to teach the full spectrum of the Primary Curriculum including Physical Education.</P>
        <P>The PE curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary.  Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the PE programme.  A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level.  In addition, many schools use <Col N="382"/>adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.  Primary schools received &euro;2000 each in PE equipment grants in 2006, at a total cost of &euro;6.5 million.  In addition, since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of &euro;5.5m in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.</P>
        <P>The extent and quality of local sports facilities has been improved dramatically in recent years, with more than &euro;450 million invested by the Government since 1998 in over 5,000 projects through the Sports Capital Programme.  At the same time, PE, general purpose and outdoor play facilities have been provided for schools all over the country through the School Building Programme.  So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, the Government is working to encourage more children and young people to get active.  Indeed, the &lsquo;State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children&rsquo; report published by the Minister for Children recently, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second-level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum.  The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department&rsquo;s approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered in the school timetable.  The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.  A revised syllabus in Physical Education as a non examinable subject at Junior Cycle was introduced in post-primary schools in September 2003 and implemented on a phased basis over the period to 2005.  No implementation dates have been set as yet for further reforms in this area.</P>
        <P>Curriculum support services provide training and school-based support for teachers.  School-based support is a very rich form of support and allows the teacher explore the possibilities and limitations of the environment in which they teach.  Through modelling of lessons and professional dialogue, the quality of teaching is enhanced and teachers are further enabled to develop their teaching skills. Teachers must also aim to include all students in PE lessons &mdash; irrespective of gender, or physical and/or learning deficits.  The PE Association of Ireland have been active in organising conferences where teachers can avail of an opportunity to witness the latest thinking in physical education, and my Department also funds programmes on PE through the network of education centres.</P>
        <P>This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities.  In a new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as part of the design.  Between 2000 and 2006 a total of 516 large-scale projects were delivered in primary and post-primary schools by my Department as part of a record overall investment of &euro;2.6 billion in modernising primary and post-primary school facilities throughout the country.  Many more large-scale projects are under construction or due to go to construction in the near future.  New PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme.</P><Col N="383"/>
        <P>A special PE funding package of &euro;3 million issued to post-primary schools in 2007, providing a grant of &euro;4,000 per school towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment.  This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.  So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we are working to encourage more children and young people to get active.  Indeed, the &lsquo;State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children&rsquo; report published by the Minister for Children recently, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware my Department is providing broadband connectivity to primary and post-primary schools under the Schools Broadband Access Programme, which is being supported by industry in the context of a Government &mdash; IBEC/TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) Agreement.  A competitive, technology neutral, central procurement process for the provision of local connectivity for schools was undertaken based on a tiered bandwidth provision, ranging from 0.5 Mbps in the case of small primary schools with less than 100 pupils up to 2 Mbps for larger post-primary schools. </P>
        <P>The school in question, which is a small primary school, was installed with a 0.5Mbps satellite broadband connection in December 2005.  In general, satellite connections were recommended only for those schools where no alternative access technology was available at the time.  Having regard to observed usage levels, my Department has procured additional bandwidth from its two satellite providers to improve the broadband connection speeds for schools on this portion of the Schools Broadband Network and the situation continues to be monitored closely.</P>
        <P>I have received representations from this school in relation to broadband and I am aware that, while being a small primary school, it is actively using its broadband connection.  A new Request for Tenders for the next phase of the Schools Broadband Programme will be issued shortly and will be based on a minimum requirement that each individual school receives a service that is at least equivalent, in terms of speed and reliability, to that currently provided.  Having regard to the general developments in broadband availability nationally, I expect that improved service offerings will be received under the new tender process.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also refers to recent EU figures on broadband for schools.  I assume that the Deputy is referring to the European Commission&rsquo;s Study on Benchmarking Access and Use of ICT in European Schools, which was published following two surveys carried out in Spring 2006.  The study found that 66% of Irish schools had broadband internet connections as compared with 67% of European schools generally, which ranked Ireland at number 20 of the 27 countries surveyed.  The surveys underpinning this Report were undertaken during the roll-out of the Schools Broadband Access Programme and I understand that at the time of survey in March/April 2006, the percentage of schools connected under the Programme would have been in the mid 80s.  Having regard to the current almost universal availability of broadband connectivity in our schools as a consequence of the Schools Broadband Access Programme, I am confident that our relative performance internationally has improved significantly.</P>

	<P>Provisional recognition was granted to the schools to which the Deputy refers to in April 2008 to open for September 2008.  The Department had envisaged that accommodation for both these schools would be provided for September 2008 at a site in the area to which the Deputy refers.  However, as negotiations for site acquisition are still ongoing it is now considered unlikely that construction of these buildings will be completed in time for the start of the school term in September 2008.  In this context, the schools have been approached with a view to securing alternative accommodation in the interim and officials from my Department are liaising with the patron bodies in this regard to assist them until the school building is delivered.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Two all-Irish schools currently serve the needs of County Kildare at post primary level. Col&aacute;iste Cois Life in Lucan and Gaelchol&aacute;iste Chill Dara in Newbridge.  A multi-million Euro building project was recently completed to provide Col&aacute;iste Cois Life with permanent accommodation to cater for a long term projected enrolment of 600 pupils, to include pupils from the north Kildare area.  Transport arrangements to this school for those pupils will continue to be available, as necessary, subject to the usual conditions.</P>
        <P>In the recent past, my Department gave careful consideration to an application for a further all-Irish post primary school for the North Kildare area and decided that the application was premature and should not be granted.  In arriving at this conclusion, account was taken of the establishment of Col&aacute;iste Cois Life under the aegis of Co. Dublin VEC to serve the needs of the west Dublin/north Kildare area.  My Department has, however, agreed to keep this situation under review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Council for Special Education was required under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 to make a report on the implementation of the Act.  Following consideration of the issues raised in the Council&rsquo;s implementation plan, and the consultations to date with the Education Partners, it is envisaged that the five year timeframe to 2010 acknowledged in the legislation is the appropriate period in which to implement the provisions of the Act in full. </P>
        <P>My Department is now at an advanced stage in finalising proposals on this basis to facilitate implementation of the remaining sections of the Act, including the provisions in respect of assessment and individual education plans.  The time taken to finalise proposals reflects the complexities involved, the need for consultation across the wide range of people and sectors involved, the need to align with the requirements of the Disability Act, 2005 and define how the Health Service Executive (HSE) and NCSE will work together under both acts.</P>
        <P>As the EPSEN Act does not provide for phased commencement by age cohort the education sector must be in a position to provide the required services to all children before the relevant provisions are commenced.  My Department&rsquo;s priority, therefore, is to ensure that the necessary training, guidance and supports are in place to facilitate the commencement of the remaining sections of the Act.  As the Deputy will be aware, during this necessary period of preparation for the roll-out of the EPSEN Act, my Department continues to expand capacity and services for students with special educational needs across the schools network, through the work of the National Council for Special Education.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.  The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 315 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools. </P>
        <P>Children in these classes benefit from having fully qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</P>
        <P>My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service. A recent initiative has been the expansion of this service to enable it to recruit a behavioural specialist support team, led by a person with a PhD in ABA.  My Department&rsquo;s ABA pilot scheme was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools. Now that a national network of special classes catering specifically for children with autism is available in schools, new centres will not be brought into the pilot programme.</P><Col N="393"/>
        <P>Since July 2007, my officials has met on a regular basis with the group in question in relation to the commitment in the current programme for Government to long-term funding for the centres that are in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable them to be supported as primary schools for children with autism. The discussions have been wide-ranging and have included curricular issues, funding and staffing.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the discussions are progressing well. My Department is very anxious to finalise these discussions so that permanent arrangements can be put in place as soon as possible. It has been agreed not to disclose the details of the discussions while they are ongoing.  The Deputy will therefore appreciate that I am not in a position to provide details of the discussions.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position in relation to the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.  The Programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes. </P>
        <P>Budget 2008 provided my Department with &euro;4.6 billion or &euro;380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions. This was a very substantial level of additional investment in the terms of the economic environment on which the budget was based. That allocation provides for paying for over 2000 extra primary teachers more than the number in schools when the Government took office last Summer. It covers the additional teachers that went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a 27 to 1 based staffing schedule along with additional teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments, to provide for special needs and the language requirements of newcomer children.  This means that in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4000 additional teachers the Government in its first two years in office will be well ahead of target.</P>
        <P>All Programme for Government commitments to improve public services including those relating to class size are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management. Even since the presentation of Budget 2008 last December there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment. In that context any reasonable observer would regard the fact that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of over 2000 additional teachers to primary schools as a considerable investment all things considered.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special needs supports on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The SENOs operate within the policy outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circulars for allocating such support.</P>
        <P>Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs.  All schools have contact details of their local SENO. It is also open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, including issues that arise in relation to suitable educational placements, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  My officials have been in contact with the NCSE and have been advised that the local SENO has not been made aware of the pupil referred to by the Deputy. It is open to the parents of the pupil to contact the local SENO regarding their child&rsquo;s special educational needs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
        <P>Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</P>

	<P>I can assure the Deputy that I am aware of the recent survey conducted by the Irish Independent in conjunction with RTE on the issue of &ldquo;cyber bullying&rdquo;, through the use of the internet and mobile phones. I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that any child would feel upset in school because of bullying &mdash; be it physical, verbal or what is being termed cyber bullying and I assure him that supports are in place to enable schools both to prevent bullying and to deal with cases that may arise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no requirement for schools to report incidents of bullying to my Department, nor do I believe that this should be the case. I also believe that it is unreasonable to expect schools to have a sole responsibility for tackling it, responsibility extends beyond the school and parents and young people themselves must take protective measures. It is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established. However, I am anxious to support schools in tackling bullying and it is for that reason that a number supports have been put in place in recent years.  Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.  In view of the increasing demands which have been placed on schools as a result of statutory obligations and the requirement for policies in a range of areas, my Department has been working to ensure greater availability of guidelines and template policies to assist schools.</P>
        <P>My Department has published policy templates for post-primary schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying on its website of as part of our ongoing efforts in this regard. The template documents are not prescriptive, but rather highlight possible approaches and potential material for inclusion in school policies.  The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour. However, it does take account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and reference is also made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) has developed further guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. These guidelines have been informed by broad consultation. The guidelines are currently being distributed to schools. It is envisaged that implementation will commence in the next school year.  Once schools have had an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the NEWB Guidelines, my Department will commence the process of revising and updating its own &ldquo;Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour&rdquo;. This review will take into account issues such as legislative developments, the involvement of the support services available to schools, technological advancements such as use of the Internet, e-mail, mobile phones and camera <Col N="397"/>phones and the latest developments in International best practice on dealing with bullying behaviour.</P>
        <P>My Department, through the National Centre for Technology in Education has also developed Policy Guidelines and Advisory Notes for schools and parents which deal with the issues of internet and mobile phone bullying.  I wish to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the &ldquo;think b4 u click&rdquo; internet safety campaign. This new campaign seeks to raise awareness and promote safe, responsible practice by young people when online.  The key messages of the campaign are:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be creative</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be yourself</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />but be in control.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The campaign has a strong peer-to-peer perspective and centres on an interactive online service, www.watchyourspace.ie developed by the National Centre Technology in Education (NCTE). This site offers practical tips and advice and supports teenagers who use the web. A key feature is the advice given from teenagers to teenagers on how to cope with the fall-out from abuses and misuse of social networking and picture-sharing websites.  This new initiative perfectly complements the other NCTE safety activities that are already up and running successfully such as Webwise, SAFT and the Once projects. The site offers invaluable help to those who may encounter cyber-bullying:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />DO NOT respond to the message as this will only make things worse</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />DO keep a record of the message so that the problem can be dealt with properly</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />DO block the sender and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />DO talk to someone in authority about what has happened.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The NCTE provides ongoing advice and support to all schools to have an up to date Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP) in operation to deal with use of the Internet. Schools cannot be connected to the schools broadband network until they confirm that they have an AUP in place. Within the school environment access to social networking and computer based instant messaging services are blocked under current filtering arrangements, inherent in the Schools Broadband Network, to which 99% of schools have connected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NCTE has advice on tackling cyber bullying on both www.ncte.ie. and on www.webwise.ie. The NCTE works with the National Parents&rsquo; Councils (NPC) on developing and promoting advice to parents. Webwise.ie is the key Irish website for advice and guidance to schools, pupils and parents. The site has materials and resources for both teachers and parents to assist children to develop safe online skills and a sense of responsibility about what to write and post on websites. Working with the NPC (Primary) the NCTE has developed a seminar to advise parents on how to engage with their children&rsquo;s online lives. Since September 2007, over a 100 seminars have been delivered in schools around the country. The NCTE has 41 trainers throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Through the combined work of the Department, the NCTE and the NEWB schools will have available to them extensive guidance to enable them fulfil their responsibilities in relation to this issue.  Dealing with bullying has also been incorporated in training for principals through the Leadership Development for Schools programme. I have also stressed to the teacher unions the importance of not just having a written policy on bullying but also ensuring a climate in <Col N="398"/>which it is not tolerated in any form and in which children know that if they make a teacher aware of bullying that it will be dealt with.  The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</P>

	<P>An Taoiseach Mr. Bertie Ahern, T.D., announced in the context of the 90th Anniversary celebrations of 1916 that the Government had decided to make the Military Pension Archive, covering the 1916 Rising and the War of Independence, available to historians and to the public.  It is the intention of the Government that the records will be made available in good time for the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising in 2016. </P>
        <P>I am pleased to report on progress with the project. Additional staff have been recruited for the Military Archives in Cathal Brugha Barracks.

	<P>On the issue of training, I am very satisfied that military training techniques are up to date in all respects. Defence Forces training plans are structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them by Government under the White Paper on Defence of February 2000.  The challenges of preparing military units for participation in international peace support operations constitute the major dimension of Defence Forces collective training.  The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces continues to be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence.  Significant investment has taken place in recent years across all facets and elements of the Defence Forces.  This investment has been assisted by pay savings arising from the reduction in the strength of the Permanent Defence Force in the context of the White Paper of 2000, which have been fully re-invested in the provision of equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.  The level of investment has ensured that Defence Forces personnel have the most modern and effective range of equipment to carry out their day-to-day roles both at home and overseas and for training purposes and I will ensure that this investment will continue into the future.</P>

	<P>With regard to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in future Battlegroups, we are committed in principle to participation in the Nordic Battlegroup (NBG) which will stand up again in 2011.  Other contributors to the Nordic Battlegroup are Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway and Estonia.  Informal discussions have also taken place between staff in the Department of Defence and representatives from Austria, Germany, Czech Republic and Croatia regarding Ireland&rsquo;s possible participation in the proposed Austrian/German Battlegroup that will be on stand-by in the second six (6) months of 2012.  During my visit to Vienna on 24 April 2008, I held discussions with Mr. Norbert Darabos, the Austrian Minister of Defence.  The issue of Battlegroups was one of the items we discussed.  Mr. Darabos advised me of the progress made to date in setting up arrangements for 2012 and the contacts that had taken place with other EU states with a view to such an arrangement. I responded that it was too early yet for Ireland to decide on any follow-up arrangement to the one we had agreed with the Nordic battlegroup. Government approval would be required before any decision to participate in the Austrian/German Battlegroup was made. </P>

	<P>The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements. The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships. All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies. </P>
        <P>The Naval Service provides a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s obligations as a member of the European Union. The Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Fishery Limits. At present, fishery protection activity accounts for roughly 90% of all Naval Service patrol time. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels may be deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue, drug interdiction operations and assistance with pollution control.</P>
        <P>The current Exclusive Fishery Limits extend to 200 miles offshore and cover an area of 132,000 nautical square miles. The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. <Col N="401"/>The number of Patrol Vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and seven. The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.  Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps. The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
        <P>The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime Search and Rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue region. In accordance with the roles assigned to them by Government in the White Paper on Defence, the Defence Forces are committed to providing support to the civil authorities including in relation to Search and Rescue. In this regard, the Naval Service and Air Corps provide support to the Coast Guard as the need arises and within their available capability.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking rests primarily with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners. However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking. The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities. There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the Permanent Defence Force is appropriately resourced to meet its operational requirements, including in relation to its role in coastal surveillance and supporting the civil authorities in this regard.</P>

	<P>Ireland is currently contributing 763 Defence Forces personnel to 15 different missions throughout the world. Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas on UN mandated operations, observer missions or undertaking representative or staff postings are listed in the tabular statement.</P>
        <P>The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are deployed, are the UN Mandated EU multi-national mission to Chad and the Central African Republic &mdash; EUFOR TCHAD/RCA with 394 personnel, the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 280 personnel and EUFOR, the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina with 45 personnel.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the UN, EU, OSCE and NATO.</P>
        <P>Members of the Irish Defence Forces serve on peacekeeping missions under Chapter VI and Chapter VII of the UN Charter.</P>
        <P>KFOR, EUFOR, ISAF and EUFOR TCHAD/RCA operate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, that is, they are entitled to use force to implement their mandates and to protect themselves and the international civil presence. Peacekeeping operations mounted under this Chapter are commonly known as peace enforcement operations where the consent of the parties is not required.</P>
        <P>The European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, established under the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1778 (2007), was formally launched by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 28 January 2008.    The mission achieved Initial Operational Capability on 15 March 2008. This marked the start date for the 12-month duration of the Operation.  The 97th Inf Battalion is being deployed to Chad and when fully deployed  Ireland will be the second largest contributor to the mission with 425 personnel. The aim of the mission is to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, and protect UN personnel.</P>
        <P>KFOR was established in June, 1999 to support the maintenance of civil law and order within Kosovo, so as to develop a climate of safety and security, which will enable the transfer of increased responsibility to the civil authorities.</P>
        <P>Ireland has participated in KFOR since August 1999. The Irish (38th) Infantry Group currently serves in the Multi-National Task Force (Centre). In addition to Ireland, the Task Force also comprises troops from the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Sweden, Finland and Latvia. The Task Force&rsquo;s area of responsibility is generally the Pristina region, covering 7 municipalities with a population of approximately 1 million.</P><Col N="403"/>
        <P>The Irish contingent currently comprises an APC Mounted Infantry Group of some 215 personnel, including a number of personnel in staff posts at various KFOR Headquarters. Last August, Ireland assumed the role of Framework Nation for the Multinational Task Force (Centre) in Kosovo for a period of 12 months.  An additional 57 Irish personnel are serving with KFOR in support of the Framework Nation role, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s current total deployment to the force to 280.</P>
        <P>Ireland has participated in EUFOR since December 2004, the successor mission to the Stabilisation force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina with which Ireland had previously been serving since 1997.  The Irish contingent with EUFOR currently comprises 45 personnel. The role of the Defence Forces personnel currently serving in EUFOR is to provide personnel for the headquarters, the Military Police Unit, Verification Teams and the National Support Element. All Irish personnel are located at Camp Butmir, Sarajevo.</P>

        <Quest> the progress made in regard to the commitment given in the programme for Government to prioritise effective enforcement of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act 2006 and the Geneva Conventions Acts 1962 to 1998 by making resources available for specialised training in the provisions of those statutes to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and by other means as may be required by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to ensure effective protection for the dignity of all persons within or passing through the State. </Quest>

	<P>The importance attached to human rights compliance in policing in Ireland is highlighted by Section 7 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  This Section sets out the functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which include providing policing and security services with the objective of protection of life and property and of vindicating the human rights of each individual.</P>
        <P>Human Rights training forms an integral part of &lsquo;Contextual Policing Studies&rsquo;, which is incorporated into the &lsquo;Student/Probationer Development and Training Programme&rsquo; at the Garda College.  New members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na now make a declaration of the need to have regard for human rights in carrying out policing duties.  Human rights training also forms part of the training provided by the &lsquo;Continuous Professional Development&rsquo; staff allocated to each of the Garda Divisions for serving members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>My Department has been in communication with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that these commitments are fully honoured, particularly in the ongoing development of training programmes within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I can also assure the Deputy that all necessary resources are being made available in this regard.	</P>

The interim target of 100 projects by the end of 2007 was achieved, with 29 new projects established that year.  The Garda Commissioner has indicated that it is anticipated that between 15 and 16 projects will be recommended for establishment each year over the next four years and that applications for 2008 will be forwarded to me later in the year.</P>
        <P>The recently published National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010 details the plans for the development of complementary programmes to the existing Garda projects.  The first step is an audit of existing programmes and the identification of any gaps.  This stage will be completed by the end of 2008 and the development of new initiatives will be considered at that stage.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that as part of Student/Probationer training all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receive training to prepare for and assist them in the investigation of incidents relating to domestic violence.  They receive this in two modules, namely Social &amp; Psychological studies and Legal &amp; Policing studies.  Additional training is also provided as part of the Continuous Professional Development (CPD) programmes and a dedicated training programme is provided for those selected for the Detective Branch.  Continuous Professional Development (CPD) incorporated domestic violence in the 1997 Core Programme for all members of Garda and Sergeant rank after the Domestic Violence Act came into force in 1996.  Furthermore, a policy document was issued to all members.</P>
        <P>The Core Continuous Professional Development Programme for 2006 contained a module on Sexual Crime, developed in consultation with the Rape Crisis Counselling Network and covered areas pertinent to domestic violence.  The situation is kept under constant review by Continuous Professional Development.  There is a Garda Inspector in each Garda Division nominated to monitor all incidents of domestic violence within the Division and to ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigating such incidents adhere to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policy on domestic violence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed that a total of 77 prisoners transferred from Cork Prison to Shelton Abbey during the time period from 17 December, 2007 to 19 May, 2008. The prisoners concerned were deemed suitable for transfer to an open centre having, in each case, taken into account a wide range of factors including the nature of their offence, length of sentence, engagement with the therapeutic services and behaviour while in custody. I can also advise the Deputy that the capacity of Shelton Abbey increased by 50% recently following the completion of a new accommodation block.  </P>
        <P>The aims and objectives of open centres such as Shelton Abbey is to provide a place of detention aimed at the rehabilitation of offenders through education and training linked with a regime which encourages a sense of personal responsibility and self respect in order to assist in them leading law-abiding lives on their return to the community. The profile of open centres generally includes either low risk offenders who are serving short sentences for minor offences or offenders nearing the end of longer sentences whose transfers have been approved as part of a sentence management programme.  It is the case that, in view of their status as lower security prisoners, many of the persons transferred to open centres do benefit from release in advance of their remission dates but I do not have the exact details sought by the Deputy immediately available to me.</P>

	<P>The provision of childcare facilities is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for children.  My Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Childcare Facilities in June 2001, which provide a framework to guide all local authorities in the preparation of development plans and in assessing applications for planning permission; <Col N="410"/>assist developers and childcare providers in formulating development proposals; and aim to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the treatment of applications for planning permission for childcare facilities. The matter is also addressed in Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans, which were published by my Department in June 2007, reflecting that the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community, including childcare facilities, is a mandatory objective for development plans under section 10 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</P>
        <P>In addition, the need for essential community facilities, including childcare, to be incorporated into the design and development of new residential developments is set out in the draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas which will issue in their final form later this year.</P>
        <P>Under section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority that benefit development in the area, based on a scheme of contributions adopted by the elected members of the authority.  The money collected in development levies is used to fund public infrastructure, including community facilities, servicing new development. As indicated in the reply to Question No. 584 of 20 May 2008, the operation of the development contributions system will be kept under review by my Department.</P>

	<P><i>Lagarosiphon major</i>, also known as the curly-leaved pondweed, is a native of southern Africa. It has been widely sold for many years as an oxygenating plant for garden ponds and aquaria.  However, it is viewed as a major threat to Irish lakes and their associated wildlife since it became established in Lough Corrib in 2005.</P>
        <P>A Lagarosiphon Task Force has been established to address the spread of the pondweed in the lake.  The Task Force includes representatives of my Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Central Fisheries Board, the Western Regional Fisheries Board, the Office of Public Works and Galway County Council.  Last year my Department provided funding to the Central Fisheries Board to purchase a weed cutting boat to be dedicated exclusively to removing <i>Lagarosiphon major</i> in the lake.  I understand that the boat is now moored on the lake and will begin operations in the next few weeks.  In this regard, I have provided additional funding of &euro;200,000 this year to the Central Fisheries Board for work involving the removal and control of <i>Lagarosiphon major</i> in the lake.</P>

I understand that, in that capacity, the Agency issued a Guidance Booklet &ldquo;Risk Screening Methodology for Cryptosporidium&rdquo; to each local authority in January 2008.  My Department&rsquo;s current Water Services Investment Programme includes 300 water supply schemes with a combined estimated value of &euro;2.4 billion.

	<P>The Waterford Grouped Towns and Villages Sewerage Scheme is approved for construction under my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007 &mdash; 2009.  I understand that the upgrading of the wastewater collection system in Kilmacthomas is underway and that the works to improve Tallow&rsquo;s collection system have already been completed.  I also understand that the Council is finalising contract documents for the wastewater treatment plants for the seven locations covered by the scheme.</P>
        <P>In October 2006, the Department of Finance, which is responsible for public procurement rules, issued instructions requiring all traditional public works projects to use new forms of construction contracts from February 2007 onwards.  The new forms of contract were introduced to achieve greater cost certainty, better value for money and more timely and efficient delivery of publicly funded projects.  However, contracting authorities were given the option of either switching over to the new forms of contract or completing any contract documents on which detailed drafting was already underway.  I understand that Waterford County Council elected to complete the contract documents they were working on for five of the collection systems, including Cappoquin.</P>
        <P>This interim arrangement has been brought to a conclusion by the Department of Finance.  All public works contracts must now be awarded using the new forms of contract.  Waterford County Council has been informed accordingly.  The contract documents for the treatment plants, which are being procured under a Public Private Partnership arrangement, are not affected.</P>

The Green Paper presents a set of options which share a common theme of strengthening <Col N="413"/>local democratic leadership. For example, Stronger Local Democracy proposes a Regional Mayor for Dublin to meet the strategic challenges the city faces. The Paper also contends that local leadership, accountability and connection with the citizen can be achieved through the provision of directly elected mayors for all counties and cities with key powers of initiative.  Copies of Stronger Local Democracy have been sent to all members of the Oireachtas.  Stronger Local Democracy represents the initial phase of a transparent, inclusive policy formulation process. The purpose is not to arrive at a single solution, but to present options for further consideration.</P>
        <P>My Department is now embarking on a public consultation process to inform the drafting of the White Paper which I hope to finalise by year end. I look forward to receiving the views of all concerned. Details of how to contribute to the consultation process are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.

	<P>Under section 247 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 a person who intends to make a planning application to the planning authority may with the agreement of the planning authority concerned enter into pre&ndash;application consultations in relation to the proposed development.  My Department issued Development Management Guidelines to planning authorities in June 2007, which are a step by step guide to all stages of the planning application process, beginning with pre-application consultations.  A copy of the guidelines is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.</P>
        <P>The Guidelines recognise the benefits of pre-application consultations in that they provide the planning applicant with an opportunity to discuss the merits of a proposal for development at an early stage. The pre-application consultations also allow the planning authority an opportunity to play a proactive role in guiding a project from its inception in accordance with proper planning and sustainable development principles.</P>
        <P>The Guidelines note that a written record must be kept of section 247 consultations and that a copy of the record must be placed on the planning file in the event of a subsequent planning application.  The stated intention is to inform those involved in determining any subsequent application, particularly if they were not directly involved in the prior consultation.  The Guidelines also recommend that planning authorities put in place management structures to inform applicants if, when the planning application is received, there has to be a material departure from the approach adopted by the planning authority at the pre-application consultation: such a departure might be required if the subsequent application is substantially different from that originally discussed, or if the planning authority needs to respond to valid issues raised by the public or by statutory consultees following submission of the application.</P>
        <P>The Development Management Guidelines were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and planning authorities are obliged to have regard to them in the performance of their planning functions.  The implementation of the guidelines by planning authorities will assist in ensuring a consistency of approach at pre-application consultation stage.</P>

	<P>The local authority service indicators initiative has been in place since 2004, and in line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government to build on the experience gained from the service indicators, the Local Government Customer Service Group recently completed a review of the indicators.  This group is representative of the local government sector (elected members and officials) and my Department.</P>
        <P>As a result of this review, from 2008 onwards there will be indicators across 46 headings as compared to the original 42.  The new indicators cover housing, motor tax, unaccounted water, planning, library services and community participation, in some cases replacing existing indicators in order to make them more meaningful.  In addition, a large number of existing indicators, including some in relation to the environment, have also been amended.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I intend shortly to launch Branching Out &mdash; Future Directions, a policy document which will drive the development of the public library service in Ireland over the next five years.  A number of ICT initiatives which have been implemented throughout the library service in recent years will continue to be developed, to enhance the quality of access to a rich diversity of information which is now freely available through the Internet at public libraries.  Further development of the Student Zone of www.askaboutireland.ie is ongoing.  This is designed to support school curricula by providing National Council for Curriculum and Assessment approved, age-appropriate structured modules for teachers and students and for independent learning.</P>
        <P>Under the Changing Libraries programme a number of nationally significant historic datasets have been developed into a collection of electronic services for the public.  The Irish Times Archive was digitised in a joint partnership with my Department and is freely accessible from the www.askaboutireland.ie website in public library branches and schools.  The Ordnance Survey historic map viewer provides on-line access to a national map set originally mapped by the Ordnance Survey between 1829 and 1913.</P>
        <P>An on-line version of Griffith&rsquo;s Valuation, the most important surviving genealogical source from the nineteenth century is in the final test stages, and is due to go live and freely available on the www.askaboutireland.ie website shortly.  A core collection of seminal local studies texts is in the process of being digitised and will be made available on-line this year.  Future Public Library Capital Programmes will also build on previous investment in ICT developments and promote its continuing spread throughout the public library service.</P>

	<P>In October 2006, the Department of Finance, which is responsible for public procurement rules, issued instructions requiring all traditional public works projects to use new forms of construction contracts from February 2007 onwards.   The new forms of contract were introduced to achieve greater cost certainty, better value for money and more timely and efficient delivery of publicly funded projects.   However, contracting authorities were given the option of either switching over to the new forms of contract or completing any contract documents on which detailed drafting was already underway.  I understand that Kildare County Council opted to complete the contract documents the Council was working on for Phase 2 of the Kildare Water Supply Scheme (Castlewarden to Ballygoran).  </P>
        <P>This interim arrangement has been brought to a conclusion by the Department of Finance.  All public works contracts must now be awarded using the new forms of contract.   Kildare County Council has been informed accordingly.</P>

It also provides for a third party affected by anti-social behaviour to take a case to the Private Residential Tenancies Board against a landlord who has failed to enforce tenant obligations. The Board can also direct the landlord to ensure that tenants comply with their obligations and can enforce compliance through the Courts.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 281 and 286 together.</P>
        <P>In areas for which my Department has responsibility, the European Commission is currently in correspondence in respect of 29 cases relating to possible infringements of EU environmental legislation.  The cases are at various stages of proceedings as listed in the following table.  There is no case awaiting a fines decision against Ireland, and fines have never been imposed on Ireland in relation to an environmental infringement.</P>
        <P>There are currently three Directives that are outstanding for transposition.  Work is ongoing with a view to completing their transposition at the earliest possible date.  In one case that would have been listed as outstanding, I have made the necessary regulations and these have <Col N="420"/>been formally notified to the Commission, so I would expect the Commission formally to close this case soon.  In the other 25 cases the Commission has raised issues about the implementation and transposition of the Directives listed; in 8 of these cases the European Court of Justice has issued judgements and my Department is working to meet their requirements.</P>
        <P>As indicated in the table nearly all cases are of national application.  Some are also site specific and location information is provided.  Given that the &lsquo;pre court&rsquo; cases are the subject of correspondence which could lead to court proceedings it would not be appropriate to provide more site specific information in relation to these cases.</P>

However, from bilateral contacts, my Department is aware that biodiversity officers are currently employed in Fingal County Council, Clare County Council and Dublin City County Council.  Biodiversity Officers, or indeed Heritage Officers who discharge the biodiversity function in a number of other areas, play an important role in the development and implementation of local biodiversity action plans.  I have provided &euro;300,000 to support the implementation of local biodiversity action plans during 2008.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 287 and 288 together.</P>
        <P>The regeneration of estates is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities and over &euro;120 million has been provided from the Exchequer in 2008 to aid this process.  This is in addition to funding from the private sector and from local authorities&rsquo; own resources.  Public Private Partnerships (PPP) are one of a range of options used by Dublin City Council to renew and regenerate their social housing estates and provide new social and affordable housing in the city.  PPPs are a way of promoting sustainable development through encouraging social, income and tenure mix in an economically efficient way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dublin City Council recently announced that the PPP regeneration projects which it had with Castlethorn/McNamara Construction in St Michael&rsquo;s Estate and O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, and with McNamara Construction on Dominick Street, Convent Lands in Sean McDermott Street, and Infirmary Road will not now go ahead as planned.  The Council is working with its tenants to explore options for regenerating the five areas concerned and  is also to examine all the social, economic and legal implications of the recent announcements, with a view to putting forward alternative proposals so that the process for the regeneration of these areas can proceed.  My Department will be actively engaging with the City Council in relation to alternative proposals for these projects.  It will also be considering the wider implications, if any, for the approach to PPPs generally.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 291 together.</P>
        <P>The Greener Homes Scheme provides support to homeowners to invest in a range of domestic renewable energy heating technologies including solar panels, biomass boilers and stoves and heat pumps.  There has been a strong interest in the scheme since it was launched in March 2006.  On foot of the achievement of the original scheme targets three years ahead of schedule, Phase I of the Greener Homes Scheme was closed on 3 September 2007.  Phase II of the scheme was opened on 1 October 2007 with assistance still provided under the above mentioned headings.</P>
        <P>The objective in Greener Homes Phase II is to consolidate the market, underpinning it with quality standards and training and providing for a long-term future that is not grant dependent.  The aim is to ensure that the market for these products, services and fuels continues to develop strongly in a robust manner and that consumers continue to be guided towards discerning choices.  Continuing the scheme is helping secure a range of objectives including more competitive offerings, revised product standards, improved training standards and stable growth across the renewable heating industry.</P>
        <P>The Greener Homes Scheme will continue to be kept under review, and will continue to evolve in light of the maturing technologies and market developments, including the consideration of additional technologies such as wood log gasifiers.  Wood energy is a sustainable and renewable energy source.  There are however supply chain issues with any new technology and I am cognisant of the issues involved.</P>

As the Deputy will be aware, Ministers do not personally pay toll charges incurred on official travels.  Ministerial cars are driven by members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Such vehicles are exempt from tolls under section 62 of the Roads Act 1993. Accordingly, no cost arises to the Exchequer.</P>

        <QRef>[20529/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no function in relation to oil, diesel or petrol prices.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, <Col N="426"/>liberalised and deregulated.  There is free entry into the market.  Prices at the pump reflect global market price, transportation costs, Euro/Dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.  The Competition Authority is a statutory independent body with a specific role in the enforcement of competition law.  The National Consumer Agency has specific responsibilities for protecting the rights of consumers.  Their function is to ensure that competition works optimally for the benefit of consumers throughout the country.  Ireland&rsquo;s high dependence on imported oil makes us price takers, sensitive to the volatility of the markets and reflecting the combination of world prices and the relative strength of the Euro against the Dollar.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, diesel has been cheaper than petrol in Ireland at the forecourts.  This was due to the fact that international prices for both products were previously in the same range, and excise duty is lower on diesel.  The excise differential in favour of diesel is 7.46 cents.  Figures from the International Energy Agency (IEA) show that the international price of diesel is now higher than the price of petrol.  This is because of increased demand for diesel both within Europe, and in China and other developing economies.  European refineries are currently not able to keep pace with the demand for diesel, which means it must be sourced from further afield, particularly from Russia.  Conversely, the IEA&rsquo;s reports show that US refineries have been producing more barrels of petrol than usual and domestic US stocks have been well above their 5 year range.  High stocks and low US prices are likely to have curbed exports of petrol from Europe to the US, leaving North West European petrol stocks high.  The combination of these market factors has contributed to the rise in diesel prices across Europe relative to petrol.</P>
