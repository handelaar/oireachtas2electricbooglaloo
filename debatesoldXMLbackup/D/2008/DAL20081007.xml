      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together. </P>
        <P>In accordance with the initiative I announced in my 2008 budget speech, an efficiency review of my Department&rsquo;s expenditure and related activities was undertaken earlier this year.  The review identified a number of proposals which, when fully implemented, will result in greater administrative efficiency in my Department and the bodies for which my Department has responsibility.  The review considered those bodies which are in receipt of funding from my Department&rsquo;s Vote, which include the National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, comprising the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, NCPP.</P>
        <P>Other bodies in receipt of funding from the Department&rsquo;s Vote include the Moriarty tribunal, the National Forum on Europe, the Newfoundland and Labrador Business Partnerships and the Active Citizenship Office.</P><Col N="764"/>
        <P>The establishment of NESDO was in itself an effort to capture the efficiency gains of sharing basic support services across three formerly separate entities, namely NESC, NESF and NCPP, while at the same time encouraging the output benefit of increased co-ordination between them in areas of common interest.</P>
        <P>As part of the implementation of the programme of reviews under the value for money and policy review initiative, a comprehensive review of NESDO is nearing completion.  The draft review report is being considered by the steering committee for the review and will be considered by an external reviewer, before being finalised.  The outcome of this review will provide a solid base for the identification of such further efficiencies as may be achieved by NESDO.</P>
        <P>In general, the level of administrative funding provided to the other bodies in receipt of moneys from my Department is small.  Nevertheless, it is my view that every scope for administrative efficiencies must be pursued and this is being done in the context of the overall review of administrative expenditure.  In general, it is the Department&rsquo;s practice to make use of shared administrative facilities and services to reduce administrative overheads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In general, that may be so.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the NESC, NESF and NESDO now all share administrative facilities.  Why has this model not been applied across other agencies?  Deputy Varadkar produced a detailed document about the growth in the number of agencies, sub-agencies and quangos in recent years.  The philosophy mentioned by the Taoiseach does not apply in general because they all have their own administrative locations and so on.  I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Finance has taken an interest in this issue and he has said he will prioritise a number of these next year.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the priorities he is setting out in this regard?  Will there be an end to the duplication and triplication of duties and resources in this area?  Will the Minister of State bring forward his proposals as a priority shortly?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has been asked to examine this issue by the Minister for Finance within the Department of Finance and the public service.  What is informing the exercise generally in terms of the principles to apply relates to the OECD report on the public service and the task force currently drawing up an action plan to implement and sequence the report&rsquo;s recommendations in a way that will bring about greater efficiencies and to address the question raised in the report regarding agencies under the aegis of various Departments.  That work is advanced and will be available shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will be aware that under the Good Friday Agreement, six new North-South bodies were set up.  I am well aware of the sensitivities that applied ten years ago when the Agreement was adopted, signed and voted on by the peoples, North and South, but surely we should be in a position, having moved on to a time of peace and progress, to consider these bodies for all-island status.  Has consideration been given to that by the Government in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Assembly?  Why do we have to have six North-South bodies, given the economic challenge that exists, North and South?  Is this not an area in which the Taoiseach could give leadership and state that, instead of having six separate bodies, we should have all-island entities, reduce the number and increase their effectiveness?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That requires political agreement.  It is important that there is a structured institutional architecture between the North and South in advancing the objectives of the Good Friday Agreement.  In the past, it was suggested co-operation could be considered on a case by case basis, which could well depend on the relative enthusiasm or commitment of the incumbents in office and the relevant Department or agency.  The purpose of insisting on six areas <Col N="765"/>of co-operation and having a structured arrangement was to ensure consistency and continuity.  It was originally envisaged that would evolve into wider areas of co-operation where further structured co-operation could be advanced and agreed.  For example, we do not have a structured co-operative system in the area of energy.  We have witnessed many advancements in this area because of the impetus from Europe regarding competition issues, the Commission for Energy Regulation, which we established, and the setting up of the all-island electricity market.  There has been a great deal of co-operation in this area and this enhances the argument for a structured set up on that basis since substantive co-operation is taking place.</P>
        <P>We should not underestimate the political significance of allowing our respective peoples to see that a system is in place which is working and being maintained and which is not simply subject to an unstructured scenario where one may not get the system in place that one wants to see.  I do not agree with the Deputy that we should coalesce those six areas.  I acknowledge his comments about all-island structures, which could be argued for on a case by case basis.  At present, there are some difficulties.  We must proceed as we are and try to encourage the spirit of the agreement, which was to consider other areas of co-operation and provide a structured basis for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be no division, North or South, in terms of politics or so on, regarding tourism.  The best known landmark in the country is the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway.  As someone who served in the tourism Department, it is my opinion that visitors to the island are visitors to all of Ireland.  In a tightened economic situation, it would be much more effective to have a real marketing proposal for the island of Ireland.  Whether visitors arrive in Belfast, Cork, Dublin or Donegal, they are visitors to the island of Ireland for everything that we have to offer.  Could we not deal with the former sensitivities in this matter and have a real, powerful and effective all-Ireland tourism marketing board, which would not infringe on politics in any way?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That body does not fall within the Department of the Taoiseach, but he may answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Tourism Ireland is an all-island body that provides for the international marketing of the island as a whole.  Our different tourism support agencies within the island could be examined, but one requires political confidence building to achieve advances in that area.  Tourism Ireland is an excellent example of the common sense nature of the all-island approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>In his first reply, the Taoiseach stated something to the effect that a comprehensive review of the National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, is under way, which would lay a solid basis for achieving further efficiencies as might be possible.  It sounds as if NESDO will either be wound up or given responsibility for the functions of other agencies.  Which direction will be taken?</P>
        <P>For some time, it has been speculated that the Government is contemplating an amalgamation of the Combat Poverty Agency, the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission.  What is the Government&rsquo;s position on these agencies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will understand that I cannot anticipate any Government decisions that have not yet been taken in any of these matters.  The aims of the NESDO value for money review is to analyse the output of the grant-in-aid funding provided to NESDO, to determine the impact of the development of public policy in line with the objectives of the Department of the Taoiseach and other relevant public organisations for NESDO and to inform future funding, administration, structural and policy decisions regarding NESDO.  The <Col N="766"/>review is being finalised by the steering group and will be subjected to external examination and come to me as Taoiseach thereafter.  I cannot anticipate its outcome.  This is not to be coy with the Deputy, but to be frank.  There are no decisions as yet.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, NESDO was a way of capturing efficiency gains in respect of the three constituent bodies under its aegis and was a good example of what could be achieved in trying to deal with administrative savings.  The value for money review is part of what one would expect in terms of ensuring taxpayers are getting the maximum benefit from grants-in-aid to all organisations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach respond to the second part of my question concerning the future of the Combat Poverty Agency, the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a slight difficulty in that they do not fall within the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach, as the Deputy well knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach might know something about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>He might have heard something on the grapevine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entirely in his hands then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">He might like to share that information. There is much speculation about these bodies.  I simply asked him the Government&rsquo;s view on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows from his own internal organisational review, about which I have been reading, everyone will be informed at the appropriate time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>He heard it on the grapevine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the recent comment that the board of F&Aacute;S holding a two-day meeting at Mount Juliet recently was inappropriate in the current circumstances, was not the whole story?  It should be just inappropriate full-stop, not just because of recessionary times.  Indeed, in a time of plenty that type of culture should not be given any approval by Government for State agencies and State boards.  Questions Nos. 3 to 6 deal with State boards and, as we are addressing the same entities in the responses to Questions Nos. 1 and 2, what intent does the Taoiseach have to address the culture that has presented itself in the State sector, which tries to emulate what has been unfortunate practice in the private sector for so long?  Surely it is an absolute requirement that the Government make an intervention and that sane and sensible practices are adopted by those entrusted to manage our State boards and agencies, without exception.</P>
        <P>Concerning appointments, did the former Taoiseach make any appointments to State boards in the period between the announcement of his resignation and the resignation?  If so, did he consult with the current Taoiseach in respect of these appointments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to these questions, as the Deputy well knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is, of course.  I beg the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s pardon.  Question No. 6 refers to &ldquo;the names of the persons appointed since May 2008 to State boards and agencies for which his Department is responsible&rdquo;.  Of course it is relevant, that is the period when the former Taoiseach held office.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="767"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The monitor refers to Questions Nos. 3 to 6.  I indicated I was referring to Questions Nos. 1 and 2 and 3 to 6.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in should always check with the referee before looking at the scoreboard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe the Ceann Comhairle should liaise with his camera crews.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should assume the Chair is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Dare I ever doubt it?  We can defer the question on these specific appointments if the Ceann Comhairle wishes.  The monitors can be corrected.  I will rest my question on the first issue raised, namely, a movement towards best practice and acceptable practice by all those entrusted to manage and oversee our State agencies and boards.  What steps is the Taoiseach taking in this area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the OECD study of the public service is to examine how integrated and relevant is the service and the extent to which we can get people to work across organisational boundaries to improve the service to citizens and to examine the question of how we make it more citizen friendly.  The idea behind setting up some of these agencies was to grant a specific remit in terms of the delivery of specific services to the public.  It is timely that we have a review of the issue.  The flexibility required, which spawned some of the establishment of agencies, was in order to overcome the constraints of departmental delivery systems, so that people could get out into the community and deliver services ascribed to the various organisations being set up.</P>
        <P>The next phase of public service reform must examine how existing agencies are governed, the dialogue and accountability arrangements in place between parent Departments and their agencies, whether there is scope for agencies to merge with others and whether there is an ongoing need for the service they provide.  The real issue in respect of agencies is guaranteeing better outcomes for the public.  The task force on the public service will examine that issue and how best to implement the recommendations of the OECD so that we do this in a proper way.  The OECD report indicates that progressing the reform and modernisation agenda for public service lies not solely in changing the institutional architecture or the allocation of responsibilities between Departments, agencies and offices or between different levels of Government but in getting the different parts of the system working differently, with greater focus on collaboration in achieving wider societal goals and in assuring that reforms introduced are appropriately sequenced.  That is the challenge I set for the task force and it will report on the matter shortly.</P>
        <P>With regard to the specific matters, I do not want to discuss individual organisations or circumstances.  Of course there is a need for us to reflect on the fact that taxpayers&rsquo; money must be seen to be spent to the best possible value.  Sometimes certain issues are raised as if they were symptomatic of a wider problem within the public service.  Where there are difficulties and problems these must be addressed and we must see that the public service ethos is prevalent and prominent in respect of how we conduct our business in these agencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the reference the Taoiseach made earlier to the Human Rights Commission and the Good Friday Agreement, will he confirm that the position of the Human Rights Commission is in line with the Good Friday Agreement and our obligations under that Agreement to establish an independent human rights commission?  In the <Col N="768"/>context of the proposed review to which the Taoiseach referred, I put to him the importance of ensuring that our obligation, as voted upon by the people, is maintained in its original form.  A merging, as proposed, of the Human Rights Commission with other bodies could in effect lead to what the eminent and respected parliamentarian from across the water, Dr. Kevin McNamara of the Labour Party, referred to as an undermining of the Good Friday Agreement, were such a proposal to be undertaken.  Having regard to the status of the Human Rights Commission, will the Taoiseach give consideration to that commission being answerable, not to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but to the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is that the Human Rights Commission comes under the ambit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Deputy knows that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>It comes under the direct mandate of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am conscious of the work undertaken by the Taoiseach towards the reaching of that Agreement and the importance of the mandate under that Agreement.  Any tampering or interference with the status of that Agreement could give rise to difficulties of a type not envisaged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach cannot be expected to answer for the Human Rights Commission when it comes under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  That is the problem we have.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad to hear the Taoiseach talking about value for money and we all support him in that.  During the events of last week, however, this House discussed the financial crisis facing the country.  The process agreed to by virtually all sides of the House was accompanied by serious concern expressed about the remuneration packages and bonuses of certain CEOs of the banks.  It was, therefore, with astonishment and disbelief that we heard a story break, within 12 hours, of a &euro;1.4 million bonus given to the top ranks of the Health Service Executive who preside over our health services&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE comes under the Department of Health and Children.</P>

	<P>That is true but it is a State agency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Deputy Reilly cannot&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>With due respect, this matter has infuriated the ordinary people in this country.  Last night the Mater Hospital closed for an hour because it could not cope.  There are people lying on trolleys up and down the length of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss that at the present time. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly has gone away altogether from the issue and is off wandering around the countryside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the review the Taoiseach said is to be undertaken, will that deal only with the abolition of some quangos and the merger of others?  Does he agree that it <Col N="769"/>should also take into account the democratic deficit created by the quangos themselves, by the fact that we transferred power out of this House to such agencies?  The Ministers under whose remit these operate no longer have power or authority to answer in this House, except in the most general sense, for the activities of the agencies that are spending taxpayers&rsquo; money.  Does the Taoiseach agree that to bring back that power here, returning it to the Ministers of the Executive in order that this House can question them about the activities of the quangos, is almost more important that merging those quangos or abolishing them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach only can answer for the State agencies and bodies under the aegis of his own Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>He should reply in respect of his own Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To be helpful, on the question of the OECD&rsquo;s comments on how to deliver a modern public service, it requires flexibility and is about changes of attitude and approach.  The genuine requirement of public accountability also arises.  How does one provide discretion at the appropriate level, while at the same time ensuring criteria are in place to avoid what might be regarded as arbitrary decision making under the guise of the use of discretion?  These are not easy issues in terms of best practice in public administration.  However, in the context of trying to provide services on the ground, there must be a tie-up or collaboration between the health, local education and welfare services.  I refer, for example, to efforts to deal with how one should help disadvantaged pupils in schools, how one ensures that people attend school or how one helps them to do so while well fed and nourished.  Apart from putting a remedial teacher in a classroom, there is a range of attributes that will secure the same outcome.</P>
        <P>What is under discussion is the scenario whereby everyone sticks to the silo system, in which this is one&rsquo;s own job, that is the other person&rsquo;s job and so on.  Consequently, although everyone seeks, with the best of good faith, to provide such services, they are not co-ordinated sufficiently well to achieve the outcomes one would expect, given the resources being input from various public sector sources.  To get down to the nitty gritty, what institutional structure is required to make that happen better than was the case previously?</P>
        <P>The Fitzgerald report is an excellent report in respect of its succinctness.  It comes from a person who has operated at the highest echelons of public administration and with a fair amount of respect from all sides.  For example, he has made the point that although a great deal of money was going into certain areas of Limerick, which was the subject of the report, the cumulative output was not what one would expect, given the resources that were being invested.  This is because a lack of co-ordination will exist unless some overarching principle is in play.  This involves a cultural change in how services are delivered, as well as the institutional and organisational arrangements.  By providing those local agencies in Limerick that were established to pull all that together, we are witnessing a far better outcome for the same level of resources.  In many cases, resources are not at issue.</P>
        <P>This is what the OECD means when it refers to trying to get an integrated public service.  Quite understandably, precedent has built up in various Departments of State over the years.  Arising from this, various types of agencies or public service vehicles have been established to deliver the expanded services that are voted in this House on an annual or continual basis.  However, the problem as I perceive it is that there must be overarching senior management within the public service with an overview of all of that.  We must get in place a structure that delivers the bang for the buck taxpayers are entitled to expect.</P>
        <P>All the time, this argument falls back to Members in respect of the parameters of their debates, for example, less money means fewer services.  However, if the money and services are better integrated, it may not be a resource issue at all.  In some areas of the public service <Col N="770"/>such as, for example, the aforementioned health service, the level of increase in resources, despite agreement by all that it should be provided as a priority, in many instances is bringing improvements to services that Members do not communicate to the public.  Many areas of the health services are working well and have improved under the new structure.  There are other areas which perennially are a problem.  Such problems are structural because of a lack of a tie-up between primary care, acute hospital care and the accident and emergency services.  Members know this to be the case and rather than falling back on the continual arguments in this Chamber, which throw more heat than light on the issue, we must get back out to those communities and tell them that while sufficient resources are being provided, they are not being provided in a sufficiently co-ordinated manner because of the perennial problems that are highlighted continually.  In many cases, best practice models can be seen in various parts of the service, such as the community or acute hospital services. People spoke to respective parties about these issues, where we are not seeing that being translated across the service in a way expected if, for example, it was an industry or best practice issue where greater productivity or better organisational arrangements are evident in the provision of services in one part of the country as against another.</P>
      
        <P>That is the challenge and all of us committed to public service provision must ensure that as we defend our political position, we also recognise that the public confidence must be bolstered in regard to the delivery of these services.  People are saying they are not getting a service in an expected way in return for the amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money they are providing &mdash; it is the taxpayer who provides the money.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We must get back to a consumer and citizen focus and to recognising that service providers, as important representatives and constituents in policy formulation, are not the full picture.  The full picture involves those people awaiting and requiring services and in many cases they are being provided to a far better standard than we give credit for in that we try to portray every aspect of the service as being in crisis management but that is not the case.  At the same time, where we identify best practice we do not translate it across the service sufficiently quickly.  On behalf of citizens, we must address that issue, not just as Government but as Parliament.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>On that topic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow Deputy Stagg to finish first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement is very interesting and I agree with every word but he did not address my question.  My question is whether the Taoiseach will consider changing the rules so that Ministers who have these agencies under their remit will answer to the representatives of the public who are waiting for and needing services and who are getting them in many cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I meant to answer that aspect.  If there is a health service consisting of 140,000 employees, for example, the idea that operational responsibility for every action of the health service should be handled in the House by a Minister is not a sensible management model to adopt.  We must be responsible for policy and where there are systems failures, the democratic mandate of every Member is to come to the House, highlight those issues and have them addressed.</P>
        <P>Real accountability is not about trying to point out that we do not have a perfect system every day of the week, real accountability is about identifying mistakes and putting systems in place so it is less likely they will be repeated in future.  The definition of accountability should <Col N="771"/>take this into account, but too often it becomes an apportioning of blame game and, more important, the apportioning of the political blame game.  This is when everybody knows that regardless of who the incumbent in an office is, they are not responsible for every operational failure in the health service any more than they are responsible for every operational success.</P>
        <P>The overall policy structure and the principle of accountability should be as I have outlined.  Then we can have a better debate, which would be far more collaborative and would bring about the prospect of improvements in the services on the ground, unlike the case currently when too often certain political opportunism takes over, whatever the issue involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo; then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments regarding an incumbent not being responsible for every minutiae of the health service.  That is why we asked for a patient safety authority.  All these Deputies to whom people come with stories of misdiagnosis or other issues can pass them on to an identifiable body to deal with them in a positive fashion and in confidence, without the glare of publicity or the need to resort to litigation.  This saves everybody much time and money and gives people the justice and clarity needed when a loved one or the people themselves have a problem with the health service.</P>
        <P>I disagree with Deputy Stagg on one point.  The problem in our health service and the reason the Mater had to close yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not having a debate on the health service now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>With due respect to the Ceann Comhairle, the Taoiseach stated a few moments ago that this issue is not all about resources and I agree, but resources are relevant.  We do not have enough long-stay beds in this country and the fair deal has not come in.  There were 130 people lying in beds in the Mater a couple of weeks ago waiting for discharge but with nowhere to go.  That is why it has to close down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>On the other side, a primary care strategy promised eight years ago to bring diagnostics to the community but it has not happened.  What have we got?  We have accident and emergency and hospital systems bunged up, where people cannot get out when they have had treatment because there is nowhere to go and people are coming in when they should not have to because they cannot get a diagnosis and treatment in the community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if the Taoiseach wishes to comment but it is completely outside the ambit of the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was making the point that there is another aspect to the delay in implementing policy, namely, that service providers in certain areas have a view.  For example, some time was required before the provision of a primary care centre in the north inner city of Dublin was secured because the matter had to be negotiated.  It is not simply a question of the Government, the HSE or personnel not being prepared to move forward with a new model.  Clearly, if people keep complaining that the model does not work sufficiently well, one has to advocate for the new model.  As I understand it, everybody agrees that this model is a preparedness to develop community services, which involves ensuring that the acute hospital sector does not capture the level of resources it currently captures. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>That cannot be done without funds. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="772"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that a strong lobby and vested interest wishes to retain the current level of resources within the acute hospital sector.  Various members of the Deputy&rsquo;s profession, depending on whether they are on the primary care or acute care side of the line, have a certain view on the matter.  Let us be fair and honest about it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, let us be fair and honest and admit the resources are not available. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a responsibility on everyone not to prevaricate on concluding contracts over numbers of years rather than numbers of months. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Talk about scoring political points, the Taoiseach is trying to blame vested interests. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem with the Deputy is that he shouts people down when he gets a response. </P>

	<P>I do not allow people to twist the facts. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Having listened to the Deputy, I am simply stating, as a former Minister for Health and Children with some knowledge of the reforms that are taking place, that it is time we were prepared to acknowledge that there are service providers&rsquo; interests which also have to be taken into account if we are to make the progress we need to make.  It is not simply a question of the Government or the Opposition not providing sufficient resources. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>From 1 April 2008 to date, two appointments were made to the board of the National Economic and Social Council, with Mr. Tom Parlon of the Construction Industry Federation replacing Mr. Liam Kelleher, the outgoing director general of the CIF, and Ms Siobh&aacute;n Masterson of IBEC replacing Ms Aileen O&rsquo;Donoghue; one appointment was made to the National Economic and Social Forum, with Senator Maria Corrigan replacing Deputy John Curran; and three appointments were made to the council of the National Centre for Partnership and Performance on which Mr. Dermot Curran, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Enterprise, Trade <Col N="773"/>and Employment, replaces Mr. John Walsh, Mr. Brendan Duffy, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Finance replaces Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Connolly, and Ms Mary Connaughton, head of HR development at IBEC, replaces Mr. Gavin Marie.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will appointments by the Taoiseach be made on the basis of merit rather than friendship, as his predecessor outlined in the House?  It is often difficult to get good people to serve on State boards due to the angst they may experience.  Those who wish to do public service are sometimes reluctant to take up positions on State boards.  Will the appointments by the Taoiseach be made on the basis of merit and qualification as distinct from party membership or friendship?</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael Party has published a detailed Bill on public appointments and transparency which would allow for persons to be appointed as chairpersons of State boards or public agencies to come before the relevant Oireachtas committee, not for an interrogation but to outline the reasons they believe they have a contribution to make to public life and the board or agency to which they are to be appointed.  Does the Taoiseach support this concept given that his predecessor stated he would like to involve the House in appointments of that nature and the Minister for Finance only last week indicated it could be useful to give some thought to involving committees of the House in appointments to some boards.  He was, I admit, not referring to all such appointments but to those of chairpersons or chief executives of important boards or agencies.  Does the Taoiseach share the view that it would improve public perception to allow such individuals to make a case in public to an Oireachtas committee by setting out their view of the contribution they could make?  Would the Taoiseach support my party&rsquo;s Bill if we were to move it or does he intend to draft and produce legislation on behalf of the Government which would give rise to the position I have described?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if the Bill has been published, but I have not studied or considered it.  If the Minister for Finance made some comments last week which were for consideration or reflection, that is fine.  I have no problem with such consideration or reflection.</P>
        <P>Appointments to boards are made on the basis of the knowledge, expertise and experience individuals can bring to the work of a board.  Knowing me is not a disadvantage or an advantage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not questioning that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many more people I do not know personally than people I do know whom I have appointed to boards.  One needs a good balance of representatives on boards, which involves not only technical knowledge of the area but also people who are involved in public administration, have a commitment to public service and who should agree to serve out of a sense of public duty rather than any monetary considerations.  From my point of view, all the appointments I have ever made to boards, in whatever capacity I have served, have been on the basis of those who were available and those I considered were best suited in respect of the skills mix that was represented on an existing board at the time.  There are also issues in regard to representation of women on State boards; the gender issue must also be respected.  Many appointments are made on the basis of nomination, by relevant groups, such as the social partners.  Various instances and circumstances apply in different situations, depending on the vacancy and the circumstances in which it was created.</P>
        <P>I agree it is important we get people of good calibre to serve on our State boards.  They are important.  Many of them operate important functions and, in some cases, they are big commercial enterprises.  It is important we get such people to serve on them.  If we were to do what is suggested, it would involve some indication of how &mdash; in anticipation of vacancies arising or in <Col N="774"/>the event of new boards being due to be appointed &mdash; it might be open to relevant committees of the House to bring in existing members or chief executives of boards and ask them what is considered to be the type of people or what areas of expertise the board would benefit from in the context of emerging vacancies.</P>
        <P>In regard to the idea of having to have parliamentary scrutiny before appointment to boards, we would want to be careful we do not compromise the independence of them in the exercise of their function once appointed.  Sometimes, with respect, there can be a partisan debate around those issues which is never helpful.  It provides some populace grandstanding for some.  That can happen on any side of the House by any committee member.  It is important we find a balance between trying to ensure we get the best possible calibre of people available and at the same time do not subject them to a level of political scrutiny, in some senses, that might undermine their ability to carry out their tasks subsequently because of some perhaps unjustified criticism that cannot be withdrawn before the appointment is made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the short time remaining for dealing with this group of questions, I will take one supplementary each from Deputies Gilmore and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and I will see if there is time available then for Deputy Flanagan to ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will make this point before those Deputies ask their questions.  I am not in any way questioning the importance of knowing the Taoiseach or any appointments he has made.  I am turning the point the other way in that I believe it would be in their interest and in the interest of service to public life that persons appointed as chairpersons or chief executives should be able to come before D&aacute;il committees and explain their views as to the contribution they could make.  It would not be an interrogative business but it would add to the status of the way they want to serve public life in that sense.  The Bill has merit from that perspective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Gilmore and the Taoiseach can reply at the end to the group of questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the statement made by the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, who said there is a need to clean-up the process by which people are appointed to public office and that there is a need to end the possibility of putting friends in high places?  Will the Bill which the Green Party brought before the House last March 12 months, which the Labour Party supported, the purpose of which was to provide for an independent, merit-based system of making appointments to State boards, or anything like it, be brought before the House by the Government in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Returning to my earlier question, did the former Taoiseach make any appointments to State boards in the period from the announcement of to the date of his resignation?  Did he consult the current Taoiseach &mdash; who was Taoiseach designate at the time &mdash; on his views regarding any such appointments?</P>
        <P>I have not had the same opportunity as previous speakers to put questions to the Taoiseach.  However, will he note my view that the relevant Oireachtas committees should be charged with scrutinising appointments to State boards?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach engaged in a rather lengthy reply on this question.  I put it to him that in effect he is stating that, all other things being equal, party supporters or members will get the nod ahead of others.  I remind him that the two recent lay vacancies relating to the solicitors&rsquo; disciplinary tribunal were filled not by Fianna F&aacute;il supporters but by <Col N="775"/>two of its councillors.  Does the Taoiseach consider this to be sending out a message in respect of transparency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I do not support the Deputy&rsquo;s contention regarding all things being equal.  I have never approached an issue relating to a State board on that basis.  I do not believe such criteria are necessary or should be used.  If the Deputy wishes to check the position, he may discover that I have appointed far more non-party members than anyone on the benches opposite did when in government.  I do not regard that as the issue.  What is important is whether people are competent, have a level of expertise and are available to serve.  It is not a question of what might be their party affiliations.  I accept that the latter can be a consideration in some respects.  However, the fact that a person supports or is a member of a political party does not disqualify them.  We must be careful not to suggest that if someone is a member of a party, this makes him or her incapable of holding office with integrity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point was made about two local authority members serving on a State board.  Should the fact that these individuals are councillors be held against them?  I do not understand that mentality, particularly when one considers that the people in question are members of our profession.  Every case should be taken on its merits.  If a person has anything for which to answer, he or she should do so.</P>
        <P>We all expect high standards but let us not subscribe to the culture where if a person is member of this profession, at local or any other level, he or she should be disqualified from serving on a board.  I contend that amendments were tabled by Deputy Charles Flanagan&rsquo;s party, in this and the Upper House, which suggested that this proposal should not be adopted as a principle in respect of appointments to State boards.  Let us be consistent in what we are trying to achieve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Consistent all right, particularly in appointing members of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There must be public confidence regarding the appointment of boards and their competency in respect of the way they conduct their affairs.  That is important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no such confidence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many who make contentions to the contrary.  Perhaps the Deputy has a number of particular boards in mind.  I recall an instance that might be regarded as enhancing transparency when, out of a political compromise, a judicial appointments board was put in place.  That happened when I was a member of a previous Government.  The need to appoint the board arose out of a political imperative and not on foot of the merit of the case itself.</P>
        <P>One can put in place all the architecture of transparency and independence one likes and people can have a view on whether it is the most effective or independent way of doing things.  I do not intend to denigrate the relevant board, I am merely making the point that the type of transparent model to which I refer arose out of a political compromise on a completely different issue.</P>
        <P>It is important that people who are appointed should serve out of a sense of public duty.  They should also serve competently and should take their responsibilities seriously.  I take the point that there is a need to ensure that public confidence is upheld in respect of these appointments.  However, I do not agree, without sufficient evidence to the contrary, with suggestions to the effect that people in particular categories are less than fit to be appointed to office.  As <Col N="776"/>is the case with Members of the Oireachtas, let their conduct and record in office dictate whether they are suitable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>All the more reason for Oireachtas scrutiny.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are a number of public bodies that are funded by or come within the ambit of my Department.  These bodies are subject to relevant employment legislation and general Government policy on terms and remuneration of public service employees as detailed in various Department of Finance circulars.</P>
        <P>In the case of the North-South bodies under my Department, An Foras Teanga and Waterways Ireland, the position is that these bodies must comply with fair and proper employment procedures and legislation in both jurisdictions.  For example, they are subject to both the code of practice for governance of State bodies in addition to the combined code on corporate governance, which applies in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>As regards groups which receive funding from my Department, these are subject to the relevant employment legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that we have had nothing but controversy since Waterways Ireland was set up?  First, we had a case of alleged harassment and bullying, an allegation that was upheld and settled and for which the taxpayer had to pay an individual a substantial amount of money.  My colleague, Deputy Dinny McGinley, raised that issue in the D&aacute;il and was provided with information the Minister subsequently had to come back and correct.  The Department did not learn from that mistake.</P>
        <P>Last week we heard of a case taken to the Equality Commission by an individual who did not get the opportunity to apply for a job because the job was not advertised or filled by open competition.  This case too was upheld and the person was found to be justified in the complaint.  Does the Minister accept that in the past we might have got away with that kind of procedure in the South?  One thing we can say for the Unionists and the North is they have standards.  We have been found out in this regard.</P>
        <P>Did the Minister have any involvement in the process in question?  Did he get a report from Waterways Ireland?  Is he happy &mdash; although two cases were successfully brought to commissions and one case is currently going through the High Court &mdash; the procedures in place are working?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Contrary to what has been alleged publicly, I am satisfied that Waterways Ireland is delivering competently on the targets in its business plan and is an effective organisation.  I am happy the body has a written policy on recruitment and promotions and <Col N="777"/>on best practice principles, including fairness and transparency.  I am assured the best public service practice is followed in all its appointments and promotions.</P>
        <P>The Deputy raised an issue with regard to advertising.  When the body was set up, it absorbed the staff that was in the canals and drainage division of the OPW in the South and the staff in the North.  Deputy Ring must accept they had to be absorbed into the new body on the transfer and I presume he does not query that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister condone bullying and does he believe all jobs should be advertised in open competition?  If he does not condone bullying, what has been done in the bullying case?  Has the bully lost his position or been brought in and reprimanded or has he got away with it?  Has the Minister not learned from the first case?  There are procedures in place in Northern Ireland and I am glad of that.  For too long in this jurisdiction, people have got away with certain practices, but they will not in Northern Ireland.  </P>

	<P>Of course posts should be subject to open competition but as I pointed out, when the body was set up the people in the previous organisations had the right of transfer into the new body.  I presume the Deputy does not query that.</P>
        <P>On the matter of standards, there are clearly written policies with regard to recruitment, promotions and best principles.  These have been laid down by the two Ministers, who make all the decisions on Waterways Ireland.  I am happy with the procedures in Waterways Ireland.  Allegations were made and an independent process took place.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the position regarding the cocaine awareness campaign announced by him earlier in 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, the national drugs public awareness campaign, led by the HSE, was launched by my predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, in February last.  The campaign focused on cocaine and young people, highlighting not only the dangers for the individuals who use the drug, but also the damage caused by cocaine related activity in society, activity that is often disproportionately felt in disadvantaged areas.  Apart from raising awareness and providing information, the campaign aimed to get individuals to challenge and change their own attitudes and behaviour and to dispel the myths surrounding drug misuse.</P>
        <P>In research conducted by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, which advises the Government on problem drug use in Ireland, it was found that information campaigns of this nature achieve best results if they are sustained for a period of time and if they have a national and a local dimension.  For this reason, the intention is to continue the campaign for some time and to initiate more local awareness campaigns to dovetail with the message and design of the national campaign run by the HSE.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I have provided funding of &euro;500,000 to the local and regional drugs task forces to run their own locally based campaigns which will highlight the issues raised in the national campaign but focus on issues relating to cocaine use in their own areas.  The task forces are <Col N="778"/>currently working on their individual campaigns and some are working on joint proposals.  Some of the ideas coming forward include cinema and billboard advertising.  It is hoped that all task forces will have their campaigns up and running before the end of the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the common helpline that was initiated at the time, is there any information on the geographical breakdown of the 10,000 hits on that line?  Is there a breakdown of the callers?  Were they users, parents, teachers or community activists?  Can the Minister of State flesh out for us the interest people have in contacting the HSE in this regard.</P>
        <P>Some time ago the death of a person following the use of drugs was very much in the news.  At the time, many people considered the death was related to the use of alcohol with cocaine and co-ethylene.  This drug mix was highlighted as a toxic development when used with alcohol.  Has any further information been brought forward with regard to this or to the helpline?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have information with regard to the breakdown of the numbers calling the helpline.  That information is with the HSE.  With regard to what we refer to as poly drug use, be it alcohol or other drugs, one of the findings from research done after the campaign was there was greater awareness among cocaine users of the heightened risk involved when using other drugs while using cocaine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>A report conducted by the HSE states that 42% of cocaine users did not think taking alcohol with cocaine was any more dangerous than using cocaine on its own.  The report also found there was not total agreement among users on the dangers of addiction.  Some 64% agreed slightly, while others disagreed cocaine was highly addictive.  Some 41% of cocaine users were not concerned at all about the effect of the drug.  </P>
        <P>I have not seen signs of the campaign in my area.  I have not seen posters or billboards up.  How effective is the campaign and is it really hitting the target area?  I am sure the local drugs task forces are doing excellent work, but are sports and community halls and schools being targeted with literature and advertising to try to protect our teenagers?  We must look at alternative areas and highlight the dangers to young people as well as targeting addicts through the task forces.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I acknowledge the figures the Deputy mentioned, but if we look at the figures for both prior to and after the campaign, we see some significant changes with regard to people&rsquo;s perspective.  The figures changed during that period.  I agree with the Deputy that a one-off campaign is not sufficient.  The HSE campaign was public and we are now conducting the local campaign.  However, if we are to conduct campaigns in the future, they will need to be closely aligned and monitored.  I am probably leaving myself open to criticism when I say the local campaign we are currently conducting should have been planned within a closer timeframe.  In respect of advertising, the Road Safety Authority has fostered a shift of minds through its continual promotion of issues.  Particularly with regard to the new national drugs strategy, this area deserves closer attention because we need to maintain momentum.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department operates a range of initiatives, schemes and programmes that support the social and economic development of rural areas and the growth of <Col N="779"/>rural business and enterprise.  Relevant schemes include the rural development programme, the CL&Aacute;R programme, the rural social scheme, the enterprise scheme for non-Gaeltacht offshore islands and the community services programme and rural recreation schemes.</P>
        <P>The Leader element of the Rural Development Programme 2007-13 includes specific measures on rural enterprise development.  The overall aim of the new Leader programme is to improve the quality of life in rural areas and promote the diversification of the rural economy, which I believe is key to achieving sustainable economic growth and stability in rural regions.  The Deputy will be aware that I launched the programme earlier this year and I expect it to be open to applications from local project promoters shortly.  The funding available for the delivery of Leader activities under the rural development programme will amount to &euro;425.4 million, which is almost treble the &euro;150 million made available for the 2000-06 period.  The new programme will also complement the other rural development measures operated by my Department.</P>
        <P>In addition to the schemes and programmes operated directly by my Department, the Deputy will also be aware that responsibility for the creation of employment in Gaeltacht areas rests with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, a body that comes within the ambit of my Department.  The work of this body includes the development of rural enterprises.  Information on assistance provided by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is published in that organisation&rsquo;s annual report and accounts, which under sections 18 and 19 of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Act 1979 are laid annually before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Information is also available on its website at <i>www.udaras.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy should note that the Western Development Commission, WDC, another body that comes within the ambit of my Department, has responsibility for fostering and promoting economic and social development, including rural enterprise and job creation in the western region.  Information on the support provided by the WDC is published in that organisation&rsquo;s annual report and accounts, which are also laid annually before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Information is also available on its website at <i>www.wdc.ie</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Particular concerns have arisen in rural areas regarding job losses.  The announcement by Aer Lingus of 1,500 job cuts will have an effect on the Shannon region, there are concerns in the Limerick region for the future of Dell and today 14 jobs were lost at Knock airport.</P>
        <P>What is the Department&rsquo;s current position in respect of decentralisation?  Has approval to proceed been received from the Minister for Finance and has a site been bought?  When can we expect work to commence on the project?</P>
        <P>Has the Minister entered discussions with his colleagues on fostering new ideas for job creation in rural areas?  Has he held discussions with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources regarding broadband?  The European average for broadband availability is 20% but this country is only at 17%.  Many rural areas cannot access broadband services and I want to know what discussions have been held on addressing that so that employment can be developed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Although the Deputy&rsquo;s supplementary inquiry on decentralisation is at a remove from his original question, I will be benign and supply him with the information he sought.  The Deputy will possibly be aware that 101 of the projected 140 staff have already relocated to Tubercurry.  I understand the OPW is pursuing matters in regard to the purchase of the site and, when these negotiations are complete, the final decision will be subject to the approval of the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>In regard to broadband, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, is proceeding with the national broadband scheme and according to the information <Col N="780"/>I have received from his Department, it is hoped an announcement will be made on the matter within the next month.</P>
        <P>The main issue arising on my agenda in respect of rural jobs is the &euro;425 million being made available under the Leader programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my next question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s last question pertained to this programme, which represents a significant fillip.  The investment by my Department in rural recreation is also creating jobs.  A lot is happening and more is planned.</P>
        <P>The project introduced under the CL&Aacute;R programme to provide three phase electricity to small businesses was a major step in the right direction because many businesses in rural areas found their expansion plans stymied by single phase power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has responsibility for rural employment.  What is his view on the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation policies for transferring jobs from major centres to rural areas?  Why did he allow the closure of 500 rural post offices?  The country now has 1,200 post offices.  How can he stand by while Teagasc closes an office from Crossmolina, a rural area, and reopens it in a town?  How can he accept the closure of rural courthouses proposed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not responsible for all those issues.  The Deputy should pursue them with the relevant line Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister discussing these issues with his colleagues or does he follow a different policy from them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering Minister&rsquo;s questions, not questions for the Government.  I can only speak about my Department&rsquo;s programmes and, as I explained to the Deputy, we have implemented the rural development programme.  We have been closely engaged with the decentralisation programme and have transferred ten out of ten staff to Furbo, 101 out of 140 to Tubercurry, 25 out of 40 to Clifden and, despite a number of delays, are now making progress on Foras na Gaeilge.  We have been creating jobs on the ground.</P>
        <P>The rural development programme is my responsibility.  I do not have general responsibility for rural enterprise, which falls to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, except for those elements addressed by the Leader programme.  I hope to be able to make a decision on the scheme by the end of this month and roll it out in the following months.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may be aware that the process for selecting local action groups to deliver the Leader elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-13 is at an advanced stage.  I expect to announce the selection of the groups to implement the programme and the allocation of funding later this month.  I anticipate the programme will be open to applications from the local action groups for funding shortly thereafter.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="781"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to see the roll-out of the Leader programme.  Last week, I tabled a parliamentary question on Leader companies and was told a new company was being appointed to ensure EU regulations are observed.  The name of this company is Mazars but I would call it a massager because it will receive plenty of State money.  I understood it is now Government policy to get rid of these massagers.  Does the Minister not have sufficient staff in his Department to ensure that Leader companies implement EU regulations?  In regard to jobs, some of these companies will be amalgamated.  Can the Minister guarantee these jobs will be open to competition and, if jobs will be lost, will the companies be amalgamated and the jobs retained even though sufficient work may not be available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>These are all independent companies.  They are not semi-State agencies.  Their boards are appointed in a certain way but the employees of these companies are not employed by the State.  At the end of the day, these are private companies and, therefore, it is incumbent on them to comply with both EU and national law in regard to employment policy.  They raised issues with regard to the cohesion process and bringing together staff in different organisations, and asked for expert advice, which is not available in my Department.  To facilitate the process, we appointed consultants to give advice to these groups to make sure we facilitate them in complying, in their actions, with the law.  The obligation is on them to comply with the law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister used the word &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; in his reply.  When does he expect to announce the programme and provide the funding so that advertising can take place?  It is important because we are losing jobs by the day in rural Ireland.  Anything that can stimulate job creation is important.  This programme should be rolled out.  Already people are asking me and other elected representatives when the programme will be launched, when they can apply and what the scheme is about.  We need to know this now and we need the scheme to be launched immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the Deputy.  I will not go back over what happened.  As the Deputy knows, the cohesion process, which is a rationalisation process that in time will pay dividends, was difficult.  There were delays and an issue was raised in Brussels, on which the European Union, thankfully, upheld the Department&rsquo;s position.  I then found that some of the companies, despite all the time they had been given, had not set up their boards according to the direction of the Department, had not appointed chairpersons and so on.  I had to take firm action at the beginning of the summer to try to get this process to move along.  That seems to have happened.  If I may say so, it is a case of &ldquo;money talks&rdquo;.  I am now hopeful that by the end of this month I will be able to announce the successful bidders.  After that, of course, they must be awarded contracts.  I hope they will be in a position to accept applications for the programme very shortly.</P>
        <P>The good thing is that all of the &euro;425 million is still there.  The fact that the roll-out of the programme has been slightly slower than I anticipated in no way affects the amount of money involved.  It just means more money will be spent over a slightly contracted period.</P>

        <Quest> the provisions he will make in the new national drugs strategy to support and assist communities and families who are affected by drug abuse, particularly grandparents who are caring for their grandchildren as a result of their own children being drug addicts and unable for the responsibilities of parenthood; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst><Col N="782"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Support for families affected by drug misuse is a key priority of the current national drugs strategy and I expect it will continue to be prioritised under the new strategy which is currently being developed.  As the Deputy knows only too well, problem drug use can have a devastating effect on the family and it is particularly important to have appropriate, accessible and timely services in place to help these families deal with the problems they face.  In this context, my Department provides annual funding to support the development of the family support network, FSN, for families affected by problem drug use.  This has facilitated the development of the network as a national organisation, thereby ensuring a more co-ordinated approach to the issue of family support within the drugs strategy.  It has also allowed the existing FSN to be established on a much firmer and more organised footing, which has facilitated the co-ordinated development of local family support groups around the country, with ongoing opportunities for networking among them.  In addition, links and partnerships between the families of problem drug users and others involved in the implementation of the drugs strategy have improved.</P>
        <P>A number of family support projects are also being supported through the local and regional drugs task forces, including through the emerging needs fund.  The services provided include support for parents, spouses and partners and assistance for children of problem drug users.  Families receive support from both specific projects aimed at families and more generic services such as community drugs teams.</P>
        <P>The role of the family was emphasised by the working group on drugs rehabilitation, which made specific recommendations regarding the role of families in the rehabilitation process.  The Deputy should also note that the National Advisory Committee on Drugs published a study, The Experiences of Families Seeking Support in Coping with Heroin Use, which stresses the need to value the role of the family in treatment, rehabilitation and recovery.  In the context of the findings of the NACD Report, the Family Support Agency and the Family Resource Centres have started to put in place links with the FSN in order to provide assistance and guidance where needed, along with the provision of funding to the FSN to allow further development of their organisation.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">During the consultation process undertaken in respect of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, particularly in the series of public meetings around the country, the work taking place under the umbrella of family support was highly praised, although it was felt that enhanced resources and support are required in this area.  The issue of support for family members, including elderly grandparents, who are caring for the children of other family members who are incapable of discharging their responsibilities due to problem drug use, was also raised.  I fully expect that this, along with other family support issues which were raised, will be addressed during the deliberations of the steering group which is currently developing the new strategy.  Their work will be ongoing over the coming months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>That sounds very good, but grandparents are the ones who must pick up the pieces when they become the primary carers and educators of children whose parents have been caught up in addiction.  At the weekend I spent some time at the Irish Bishops&rsquo; Conference on alcohol and drug abuse in parishes and communities.  I noted that many of the people who spoke were grandparents and parents.  Many of these mentioned the difficulties of accessing any kind of programme to help them deal with the challenges of bringing up their grandchildren.  They find they are being sent from one agency to another.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that this is dealt with in the new national drugs strategy.</P><Col N="783"/>
        <P>The Minister named some of the relevant agencies.  Some of the people I spoke to at the weekend did not have a clue what these agencies were.  These are the people who are at the heart of all this confusion.  I ask the Minister to accept there is real concern out there among families, particularly grandparents, and ensure this is taken into account in the new national drugs strategy.  These people should be dealt with fairly and the agencies made available to them so that they are not sent from one agency to another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I address the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I want to clarify that at the moment there are quite a number of family support projects.  Around 120 such projects are being run by local drugs task forces, while the regional drugs task forces are running 50 projects that have been identified as providing primarily family support.  During the public consultation period for the new national drugs strategy, the issue raised by the Deputy came through loud and clear, with regard to both family support and grandparents who are primary carers.  As the Deputy knows, the steering group, which consists of representatives of the key statutory, community and voluntary interests, is going through the deliberations.  I have no doubt that the specific issues of family support and grandparents are being considered for the new strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate what the Minister is saying.  The goal of ensuring people know what services are available should be included in the national drugs strategy, as they do not seem to know at the moment.  That was quite obvious to anybody who was at the conference at the weekend.  Parents and grandparents cannot identify the groups that could provide support even in their own areas.  That should be a focus of the national drugs strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy.  During the public consultation process it was found that the availability of services seemed to vary radically around the country.  In some parts of Dublin services are more accessible and better established, while in other parts of the country there is clearly a deficit.  I acknowledge and agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s point.</P>

	<P Just="Left">During the consultative phase for the new national drugs strategy, I, along with members of the steering group, met representatives of the Department of Education and Science to discuss the issue of early school leaving.  That Department is also represented on the steering group charged with developing the new strategy and will be centrally involved in the group&rsquo;s deliberations with regard to the prevention and awareness pillar.</P>
        <P>Addressing early school leaving is also a central pillar of the actions aimed at children set out in Towards 2016.  A number of mainstream actions were developed by the Department of Education and Science over the lifetime of the previous national development plan and are being further developed under Towards 2016.  Among these are the work of the National Education Welfare Board, the National Educational Psychological Service and the home school liaison schemes, and actions under DEIS and the Traveller education strategy.</P><Col N="784"/>
        <P>Under the aegis of my own Department, Pobal and the partnership companies have been developing initiatives to tackle early school leaving from a community perspective through community-based youth initiatives and services for the unemployed measures under the local development social inclusion programme.  Community-based initiatives in this area also form part of RAPID education programmes to address, among other things, inter-generational disadvantage.</P>
        <P>In this context, the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v recently launched the education-themed strategy under the RAPID programme.  Under this strategy, each RAPID area will be requested to develop a local strategy that will focus on working with local service providers and programmes on the educational needs of RAPID residents with the aim of improving educational outcomes at primary and post-primary level, increasing participation in further and third level education and improving links and communication between education authorities and providers and local RAPID structures.</P>
        <P>The steering group for the new drugs strategy is fully aware of the strong correlation between early school leaving and the early onset of problem drug use.  They also recognise that dealing with early school leaving is now a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s wider social inclusion policy and that community initiatives are being developed as outlined above.  Therefore, a key question for consideration by the steering group will be how best to identify actions under a new strategy that will complement and add value to the other initiatives in place to deal with this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>A report published in August showed that children who left school at an early age and particularly before doing their junior or leaving certificate examinations were more at risk of taking drugs.  Over the summer months I was appalled to see that the Department of Education and Science had made cutbacks in the school completion programme which targets children who leave school early and affects approximately 25,000 children.  The National Educational Welfare Board can no longer deal with children who do not attend school for 59 days.  It can only deal with children who miss 60 days or more because of under-funding and lack of staff.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister of State had discussions with the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that there will be no more cutbacks in these programmes that affect the underprivileged in society?  What will he do regarding the national drugs strategy?  Will he provide funding to try to help keep young people at school?  It is very important that this programme is kept up.  Whatever hope we have, if we do not deal with them at an early age, we will have no hope if they leave the school system uneducated.  They will go out into the world and, naturally, they will take drugs.  What will the Minister of State do about that?  The Minister of State will shortly announce a national drugs strategy.  I hope it will have funding to deal with this issue and to educate children in the schools about the effect of drugs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that early school leaving correlates to those who engage in drug taking, as has been clearly demonstrated.  While one can argue figures in whatever way one likes, in recent years on a national level most of the figures indicate that participation rates in second level education in particular have improved.  I do not want to go into them in great detail.  While that might not have improved as much as we would like, the quarterly national household survey showed that in 2001, some 16.1% of people had not completed leaving certificate examinations.  That had reduced to 14.3% in 2006, which indicates the situation is improving.</P><Col N="785"/>
        <P>The Deputy asked specifically what my Department would do to keep children in school.  Separate from the Department of Education and Science, most of the projects we run are community-based projects through the task forces aimed at disadvantaged areas where the incidence and the risk are greater.  That will continue to be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously boredom is the biggest problem for children who leave school early.  They then move on to experiment with drugs, etc., and then get caught in the net of drugs misuse.  The Minister of State and his predecessor would agree with me regarding the alternatives including sport and recreation which we need to develop.  Any examination of those who leave school early would show that the children are not involved in useful activity with their peers.  In future, I hope we will see drop-in centres etc., being created in those areas so that these children will have some place to go.  If their parents are working, the children are at home on their own and boredom sets in.  Is funding available for drop-in centres, particularly in RAPID areas?  What is the Minister of State doing to ensure the involvement of children in some form of recreation to ensure their minds are kept active and avoid boredom leading them to experiment with drugs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that activity for young people is very important.  Very many sports facilities have been created under the sports capital programme in recent years.  In other areas we have the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund providing additional facilities.  If I have seen a weakness at all, it is as follows.  In recent years we have provided a considerable amount of sporting activity which is fine for people who are that way inclined.  However, the deficit has been in alternative social and recreational activities.</P>
        <P>In recent years we have started to embark on issues like youth caf&eacute;s.  While some of those are funded through the people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund and others, they are a new model.  We need to ascertain how to have a youth caf&eacute; that has real impact and with which people can associate.  In my relatively short period in this position, I have visited a number of them and they are all doing different things in different ways.  I recently visited the Gaf youth caf&eacute; in Galway which is outstanding in terms of what it is achieving.  Rather than simply providing more youth caf&eacute;s or more facilities, we need to focus not just on the facility or staff, but on what it is that makes it successful.  I agree absolutely with the Deputy that those sorts of initiatives on the social and recreational side, in addition to what has already happened on the sporting side, are the way to go.  Young people need alternative distractions to keep them from engaging in drugs misuse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>In my constituency of Dublin South Central, particularly the inner city parts of it, 29% of people left school before doing junior certificate examinations.  My past experience was as a voluntary youth worker in a community.  When children leave school at a young age, they hang around during the day and this continues into the night time.  In the evening time many youth and outreach workers in facilities in the area do not stay after 6 p.m. or 7 p.m., which has become a major problem.  They stay until it is time to clock out at 7 p.m. after which young people stand around.  This continues until the early hours of the morning and can create other problems for residents in the area.  My main concern is that there should be no cutback in the school completion programme.  It is an area on which we need to focus and give it as much funding and help as possible. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no votes in the drugs strategy and it is not a major political issue.  Would we not be better off with one Minister who deals with the areas of health, education and justice?  The Department of Education and Science deals with one aspect, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform deals with another part of it, while the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs deals with another part.  Would it not <Col N="786"/>be possible to introduce one agency to deal with all?  If the Minister of State were such a Minister, he would not allow the abolition of the school completion programme, which is important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s final question is probably the most unusual way to ask for my resignation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>We could make the Minister of State Minister for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be very difficult for the national drugs strategy to fall under the remit of any one Department.  We talk about health, rehabilitation and treatment, which is one very clear area.  Earlier I answered a question on providing additional recreational and sporting facilities.  It is specifically because of its diverse nature that we need somebody co-ordinating it rather than having one specialist Department with a lead role.  It is based on a number of very clear and specific pillars, including the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I believe we need another Department and another Minister &mdash; it need not necessarily be me and if the Deputy wants to get rid of me, that is fine.  Other than the key agencies that are delivering specifics in the areas of health, education, etc., it needs an overall co-ordinating role, otherwise, some of the very relevant aspects the Deputy seeks would be overlooked.  They would not be seen as relevant and would not be in the pecking order.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Deputy Byrne spoke about centres closing in the evenings, which I have witnessed in certain areas.  It has never been the practice, nor will it ever be the case, that every facility will be able to operate at all times and every club and organisation would have full-time paid staff.  We need to go back to where we came from, which is the ordinary volunteerism in our community and people being involved with young people in youth clubs.  I grew up in an era, as I am sure Deputy Byrne did, in which I did not know a single paid youth worker or sports officer &mdash; they did not exist.  While we have introduced them and they are great, the whole area of volunteering is still as relevant today and we all have a role to play in that regard.  We cannot have our young people constantly looked after and facilities provided without our input as parents.  It would be awful to think of sending my children to a football match if I were not prepared to drive them or go and help.  Parents have a role to play as volunteers as much as anything else.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has a mandate in relation to communities, be they urban, rural, Gaeltacht or island communities.  Many of our programmes and schemes focus on communities, particularly on those that are vulnerable, disadvantages or under threat.  As well as communities that can be defined in terms of geographic location, the Department supports those that are defined on the basis of a common focus on a particular issue.  While these programmes do not specifically provide grants to groups involved in the care of older persons to provide social activities, the following are some initiatives through which my Department provides support for and facilitates these groups and organisations in their activity.</P><Col N="787"/>
        <P>Under the scheme to support national organisations, my Department provides multi-annual funding to a number of national groups towards core costs associated with the provision of services including services for older people.  The following organisations were among those granted multi-annual finding for the period 2008 to 2010: Age Action Ireland Limited &mdash; &euro;53,000 per annum; Irish Senior Citizens Parliament  &mdash; &euro;100,000 per annum; Active Retirement Ireland &mdash; &euro;93,000 per annum; the Older Women&rsquo;s Network &mdash; &euro;150,000 per annum; and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland &mdash; &euro;106,000 per annum.</P>
        <P>Under a joint CL&Aacute;R-HSE health measure, which I recently announced, funding is provided for various health projects, including the development, refurbishment and improvement of health centres, and the upgrading, refurbishment and equipping of day centres for older people.</P>
        <P>Under the RAPID programme, funding is provided to support small-scale projects identified locally by the area implementation teams in each of the RAPID areas.  Under the health sector co-fund, my Department and the Department of Health and Children provide funding through the Health Service Executive, to support small-scale health and community projects in RAPID areas.  The 2008-09 scheme, for which funding of some &euro;4.6 million is being provided, will focus on services and facilities for older people, namely, those over 65 years.  The purpose of the scheme is to enhance and provide facilities that will enable older people to live independent lives.  The health leverage scheme will assist with the implementation of projects as identified by the health sub-groups &mdash; operating under the health strategic theme &mdash; and endorsed by the RAPID area implementation team.</P>
   
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P el="0" Just="Left">While the rural social scheme, RSS, does not give direct grant aid to the types of groups referred to by the Deputy, it does provide support to a number of community groups nationally that are involved in activities such as meals on wheels, visiting the elderly and rural transport schemes.  Through this work the RSS plays a significant role in providing real and tangible support to communities.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding, on a pilot basis in seven areas around the country, for the evening rural transport scheme.  Funding of &euro;500,000 was pledged for this one-year pilot initiative.  The scheme, administered by Pobal and operated on the ground by the Department of Transport by way of local transport providers, has proven very successful, and has been particularly welcomed by many older persons who use the service.  Reports from the Department of Transport indicate that in excess of 60% of the people availing of the service are free travel pass holders, thus indicating the value of the scheme to older persons in the context of providing them with access to a wider range of social activities in their localities.</P>
        <P>The programme of supports for local community and voluntary groups is designed to enable community facilities to be developed to enable greater use by people of all abilities.  In addition to funding for the refurbishment of community centres and community owned facilities, the programme provides supports for equipping these centres and providing training to volunteers, staff and members of the communities.</P>
        <P>My Department also implements the community support for older people scheme.  This scheme does not provide for social activities directly but addresses their home security needs.  The scheme covers the costs of socially monitored alarms, external security lighting and a range of household security affording the older person some degree of personal security to attend and participate in social activities.</P>
        <P>Grants are available from the Sports Council fund for the promotion of sport and physical activities among older people.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="788"/>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for this reply.  Obviously, this is a very important question, given the age profile of the population.  Looking at the figure of &euro;53,000 for Age Action Ireland, I am reminded that last week was Age Action Week and in my area a very active group provided all types of entertainment for the senior citizens.  Ultimately, the figure of &euro;53,000 does not equate to &euro;2,000 per county and it is very small relative to what is needed.  However, I take the point made by the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, on volunteerism.  That law has ultimately emerged and the ESB has been a significant sponsor in this regard. </P>
        <P>The Minister talks about safety etc., but we must ensure that senior citizens in rural areas are protected.  On that aspect, what is being put in place to ensure this happens?  I recently tabled a question to the Minister of Transport who told me there were no waivers for the rural transport initiative.  That is very narrow-minded.  It is not right as it seems to defeat the original purpose of the rural transport initiative, which was to allow people to travel to the various towns and interlink with social activities in these areas so that they were not prisoners in their homes.  I ask the Minister to look at that.</P>
        <P>It is possible to increase funding to make it attractive for the many volunteers that are willing to help.  However, the initiative must be driven by the Department to ensure it happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The money for the groups, Age Action Ireland and Irish Senior Citizens Parliament, is for the core central office.  I do not believe this is an issue that can be driven in the communities around the country by putting money through a core central office.  I am not against the existence of a core central office, but all that money goes to that office.  We get the moneys to the communities through the various schemes we operate, for example, the rural social scheme.  Much of the work done by the rural social scheme involves going into people&rsquo;s houses, providing transport services &mdash; many of the community buses are driven by people on the scheme.  That is a very efficient way to get the services to where the people are, by going directly to the people with the service. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, the pilot evening transport service is in seven areas.  Funding of &euro;500,000 was provided for that on a one-year basis.  That will have to be evaluated.  The word on the ground is that it is good, but we will have to get some objective measure on how well that programme is working and we will consider that.  There is, of course, the community support for older people, CSOP, scheme, which provides locks and various things for the elderly.  That scheme is operated by the Department.  There is also the community services programme.</P>
        <P>Each community is much better off by having access to schemes directly and tailoring those to its particular needs than by having one central template administered by a specific body.  My experience in my community with the delivery of services to older people and in other rural and urban communities I visit is that they are accessing schemes such as the community services programme, the rural social scheme etc. and making very good use of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spoke about the evening rural transport scheme and said he would do an evaluation.  Does he expect to roll out that scheme nationally?  Deputy Wall raised the question of funding and I agree with him.  I agree with the Minister on setting up agencies to distribute moneys.  Small amounts of money work very well, as for example in north Mayo with the funding for the wheelchair bus.  That has done a great deal for people in wheelchairs there because there is no public transport in north Mayo.  That is the type of initiative that is needed rather than giving money to big agencies, which can take months to distribute it.  That does not work.  I ask the Minister to look at the smaller cases to ensure they get an opportunity, and keep it simple.  These days, the Government makes everything difficult, but it is the simple measures that work. </P><Col N="789"/>
        <P>Has the Minister made representation to the Minister for Health and Children, the Taoiseach and the rest of his Government colleagues to ensure that the medical card for the over 70s is retained?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.  It appears today I am meant to be the whole Government wrapped in one, but I will let that pass.  It was a good try. </P>
        <P>The Deputy is absolutely right.  He and I have long agreed that the simpler the money trail from central Government and the more flexibility there is on the ground, the better the service.  In all the changes we have made in terms, for example, of the cohesion process, that is exactly what we are talking about.  Let us keep the bureaucracy slim and the frontline services strong.  Certainly, in all the discussions that have taken place, I have emphasised that.  Take the CL&Aacute;R programme, for example, and the rural social scheme, I am trying to simplify the community services programme and make it more streamlined.  I cannot understand why the rural social scheme has a much slimmer bureaucracy attached to it than the community services programme.  I discussed that with the officials and have asked why, if one scheme can be administered for 2,500 people, with large overheads, the other scheme cannot be administered for an equivalent number of people.  I agree with the Deputy.  That is something I have certainly been working on, and I will continue to do.   I know I will have his support in trying to deliver moneys in the simplest manner possible to local groups.</P>
        <P>If we take a scheme such as the community service programme, that was not specifically set up for older people but for any service the community decided it needed, and often that is the best way to proceed.  In that way, the service for older people is often provided, even though the scheme is not exclusively set up for that purpose.  We often provide walkways and so on.  Too often we are over-prescriptive in centralising schemes rather than allowing communities to make use of particular aspects of programmes for their members, as required.</P>

        <QRef>[33517/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Dial-to-Stop Drug Dealing Campaign was officially launched last week on 30 September.  The initiative involves a number of local and regional campaigns, which will be run through the mechanism of the local and regional drugs task forces.  The campaigns are being designed to encourage people to provide any information they may have on drug dealing &mdash; anonymously if required &mdash; through a confidential telephone line.  This information will then be forwarded to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for appropriate follow-up action.  Under Phase 1, five local campaigns will be launched on the following dates: Dublin north east LDTF on 8 October; Tallaght LDTF on 9 October; Blanchardstown LDTF on 17 October; south west RDTF on 20 October &mdash; date to be confirmed; and north inner city LDTF on 28 October &mdash; date to be confirmed.</P><Col N="790"/>
        <P>Each local campaign has been tailored to the requirements of each area as identified by the drugs task force, working closely with local communities.  The input and co-operation of local communities is essential to maximise the effect of the campaign in their areas.  Each task force has identified the most suitable advertising method for its community and this will be done in a variety of ways, for example, by household door drops, posters in retail outlets and pubs etc.  The leaflets and explanatory information will also be available in schools, community centres, public areas and sports clubs.</P>
        <P>Campaigns in the remaining task force areas will be rolled out over the coming months.  In addition to providing further information, which will aid the Garda&rsquo;s efforts in tackling drug dealing in local areas, it is expected that campaigns will have significant added value in promoting greater links between the community and the Garda and in promoting drug awareness at community level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the initiative.  My primary concern relates to the security of the caller.  In recent times, computers, laptops and so on have been stolen all over the place.  The confidential telephone line is of major significance to this initiative if it is to function properly and be a success, which everyone wants.  I congratulate the Garda on its recent efforts in this area.  However, the security of the caller is important and I hope that will be highlighted at every opportunity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My other concern relates to the literature I received.  I absolutely agree with the Minister of State regarding the National Roads Authority and the programme it is running on television.  Protection of the family must be highlighted and that is not encompassed by the literature.  Perhaps the Minister of State will examine this in conjunction with his officials and public relations people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I assure the Deputy the security of the caller is absolutely paramount and that is why the system is organised so that a call from a member of the public goes directly to an independent call centre and not the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Callers do not have to furnish their names or addresses nor do they have to disclose their identity.  Reports will be drawn up by the call centre and they will be passed on to the Garda national drugs unit, which will deal with them centrally or through local drugs units.  However, it is critically important that members of the public have confidence that their identity will not be revealed.  Prior to launching the campaign, a pilot project was undertaken two years ago in Blanchardstown.  Significant violence, intimidation and fear are associated with drugs and drug dealing and quite often people in the community have information and know what is happening but do not feel comfortable and safe about reporting it.</P>
        <P>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about family protection and so on.  However, I have one clear, simple message.  If a person is living in a community and has information about drug dealing, which he or she feels may be useful to the Garda, we guarantee them their identity will remain anonymous.  In its own right, it may not be enough but it may assist the Garda, which obtains information from a variety of sources.  I appeal to people to use the telephone number and to deal with the Garda.  The Deputy is correct that the key factor in ensuring the campaign is a success will be that individual callers are absolutely assured of anonymity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the timeframe.  If this pilot scheme works, will the Minister of State roll it out all over the country?  The most important aspect of this is to get it into churches and schools to ensure people know about it.  As Deputy Wall said, the primary issue is security in order that people know when they make a call, their name will not be revealed because we are dealing with dangerous thugs and vicious people.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="791"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a national scheme given the pilot scheme was undertaken previously.  The scheme will run for approximately nine months and this is the first of three phases.  One of the reasons it is being rolled out in phases is to prevent a situation where, if the floodgates open, the Garda could be unable to deal with the number of calls.  However, this is a national scheme, which will be implemented through the local drugs task forces.  This first phase is being launched and phases two and three will run over a nine-month period.</P>

    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, the Fine Gael Party supported the action taken by Government in defending our economy and maintaining the banking system.  Has the Government approved the scheme?  The Taoiseach has been briefed by the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the institutions named in the guarantee.  Arising from the briefings and the information provided, has the Government calculated the property-related bad debt in the <Col N="792"/>institutions involved?  Does the Taoiseach know the scale of this?  Will he give an assurance that the level of property-related bad debt poses no threat to the solvency of the institutions in question?  It is perfectly obvious that significant sums are being moved from other institutions to those named in the guarantee, which is not yet in place because it has not been approved by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  When will it be introduced in the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The scheme has not been approved by Government.  It is at an advanced stage with work being done on it by the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  The preparation of the framework for the scheme to give effect to the guarantee is at an advanced stage.  The objective is to enable the terms and conditions of the guarantee to be prepared in accordance with the objectives of the legislation.  The Government is anxious to enable this process to proceed and be completed, including the consideration of draft schemes by the House, as soon as possible.  I cannot say exactly when these will be finalised.  There will be a need for discussion between the authorities and the EU Commission to ensure the scheme meets State aids and competition requirements, which is important.  This is an evolving situation.</P>
        <P>With regard to question of the provisions in the banks themselves, what we did last week related to the need to provide confidence in the market as we dealt with capital outflows from Irish credit institutions to the extent that we were advised it had reached the stage where the Government needed to act and, on that basis and on that advice, we made the decisions we made.  The question of how lending practice proceeds from hereon in relates to the work of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank in dealing with the overall financial stability of the system.  The legislation considered by the House last week provides options in that regard.</P>
        <P>Clearly, the issue dealt with last week was the liquidity of the Irish financial system and the need to improve liquidity where global financial markets had dried up to a large extent.  The position has not dramatically improved in a global sense and the issue still remains.  We are not in any way out of the woods regarding this matter.  The banks and credit institutions must continue to do their work in terms of conducting their business and taking account of the new realities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, there are a number of problems.  My party supports the action taken by the Government, but it is important we know the attached conditions.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has not responded to my question on whether the extent of bad property debt known to the Government, as outlined by the banks, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, will impact on the solvency of banks.  Will he assure the House that the extent of the debt will not impact on the solvency of any of the institutions?  What is the position regarding institutions beyond the named six?  While the guarantee is not in place, my understanding is that there is fluid movement to the institutions named in it.</P>
        <P>It is not a Central Bank or Financial Regulator scheme.  Rather, it is a Government scheme underwritten by the taxpayer to the extent of &euro;400 billion, between &euro;200,000 and &euro;250,000 per worker.  In the interests of the taxpayer and the Government, it is important we know to what we are signing up.  Banks are daily in a position to indicate the loans they consider to be bad debts.  Given the risk associated with bad property debt and loans in a number of institutions, a different guarantee scheme in each case will be required.  When the guarantee scheme is before the House for approval, will it reflect the difficulty and range associated with bad property debt in each institution?  For bank or financial institution X, a particular kind of scheme may be required while the scheme for another institution, one with a greater risk attached to <Col N="793"/>its property loans and debts, may be more robust, rigid and regulated.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the position?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the drawing up of the framework for the schemes to give effect to the guarantees provided for in the legislation and to answer a previous question that I may not have answered, the Minister for Finance has already made it clear that applications from the subsidiaries of parent bodies incorporated and regulated outside this jurisdiction for inclusion in the guarantee scheme will be considered where the subsidiaries have substantial engagement in the economy on a retail basis, subject to their meeting the terms and conditions of the scheme.  No more than in the case of the six named institutions covered by the initial Government announcement, our authorities will need to be satisfied that the necessary terms and conditions are met in each case.  Each applying organisation will also need to decide whether it wishes to participate in the guarantee scheme when the full terms of the scheme are considered by it.</P>
        <P>We have already made it clear, both domestically and in our communications with other EU member states and EU authorities, that the guarantee scheme is designed to ensure financial stability.  It is not intended to provide a basis for predatory activity based on an unfair competitive advantage, which has been made clear to all relevant credit institutions in Ireland and will be reflected in the terms of the scheme.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out that the Minister for Finance is reflecting on the issues raised with him in his finalisation of the detailed scheme.  As Deputy Kenny stated, the question of what terms and conditions will apply to individual credit institutions will be determined by the criteria set out therein.  They will not be exactly the same in every case.  The idea is to provide a guarantee scheme that reflects the commercial realities of the situation.  The purpose of providing the scheme is to try to ensure we protect the interests of the economy and the taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Since our last Leaders&rsquo; Questions last Wednesday, there have been a number of significant developments in the economy.  Disturbing and bad Exchequer figures have been published and, today, the ESRI&rsquo;s quarterly review was published.  It told us the country will be in recession this and next year to a higher degree than previously predicted.  The review also predicts that unemployment will rise to 8% in 2009.  The live register figures have been published and show that almost 80,000 more people are on it than at this time last year.  Yesterday, the recently privatised Aer Lingus announced it is to add another 1,500 people to the live register.</P>
        <P>When the D&aacute;il resumed after the summer break, I asked the Taoiseach whether he could identify any initiative taken by the Government to deal with the problem of rising unemployment.  At the time, he could not.  I have read the Government amendment to be tabled to the Labour Party motion for tonight&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; debate, but I cannot find in it any new Government initiative to deal with the problem of unemployment.  What new initiative, if any, is the Government planning to deal with the increasingly serious problem of growing unemployment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware we are preparing a budget for next week.  All of these issues are being considered with some degree of detail as to how we can, on the one hand, provide the necessary changes in public finances to ensure we arrest the rate of increase in public expenditure seen in recent years in different economic circumstances and, on the other hand, provide a means by which we can in the coming years ensure we address the imbalance currently taking place.</P><Col N="794"/>
        <P>It is a question of trying to ensure we provide a means by which the country can continue to provide more investment and employment.  As the Deputy pointed out, this is taking place in a more difficult economic environment, in which there have been 70,000 job losses in the past 12 months compared to more than 640,000 created in the past ten years.</P>
        <P>We must put measures in place to ensure that those who become unemployed are given effective employment services and training supports to assist their return to employment as soon as possible.  We are acting to help newly redundant workers.  They are now being referred immediately to F&Aacute;S instead of waiting for three months on the live register, as was the case previously.  F&Aacute;S will be providing a range of certified, short, flexible programmes designed to upskill redundant workers.  A number of programmes are already in place, the frequency and range of which will be expanded during the coming months.  Through various agencies, we will continue the training and upskilling of the workforce in line with the national skills strategy.  We must acknowledge the substantial support given to community employment schemes, which give people employment experience and assist in their return to the open labour market.  These are positives in dealing with the immediate reality for those who become unemployed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is also a need to examine inward investment.  Last month, the CEO of IDA Ireland told the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment how inward investment is ahead of where it was in September 2007 despite the difficulties we are facing.  Equally, indigenous industry is ahead.  Despite the difficult background against which we are operating, there are proactive measures in terms of employment supports and wider enterprise support policies to try to maximise opportunities for employment as they arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>All of that is an &ldquo;as you were&rdquo;.  It is a recitation of the measures, schemes and steps already in place.  What those who have been losing their jobs, many of whom the Taoiseach and I meet, are asking is when are they likely to find work and what steps is the Government taking to source and encourage new employment for them.  They are wondering for how long they will be out of work.  They have suddenly dropped to a situation where they are on social welfare, with substantial household bills to meet and large mortgages.  In the past few days my colleague, Deputy Shortall, has highlighted the extent to which people now have recourse to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, mortgage interest relief and other measures they never thought they would have to access.  We know what has been happening in construction for some time but it is also happening in services that have been supplying the construction industry and professions associated with it.  Young professionals &mdash; solicitors, architects and engineers &mdash; are losing their jobs and finding themselves out of work with a large mortgage as they start their lives.</P>
        <P>The questions they ask are when they will get a job, how long they will be out of work for and how long the Government plans on leaving them on social welfare.  The scale of what has happened over the past 12 months in terms of people losing jobs has not been fully grasped by the Government.  A debate will be held tonight on foot of the Labour Party motion but the self-congratulatory, business as usual amendment that the Government tabled is not the response that these people were seeking.  We need to hear that new initiatives are being contemplated and will be taken to get people back to work and provide hope for those who find themselves in a new situation, one they never anticipated and are finding increasingly difficult to cope with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing self-congratulatory about this or any other Government amendment.  It acknowledges that unemployment has increased from 4.5% to 6.3% this year.  The Central Bank and others, as the Deputy points out, indicate that next year we will have <Col N="795"/>great difficulty in creating growth in the economy, that there is a wider downturn in the world economy and that this open economy is not immune from those developments.  It is acknowledged that they are hitting us hard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the meantime we must provide for investment and continue with significant investment in the Irish economy.  In the coming year, despite the difficult budgetary situation we face, we will continue to prioritise the areas that will give an economic return more quickly than other projects, such as major investment in a public capital programme, which is very significant.  We have seen that significant investment in the past seven or eight years.  A sum of &euro;2.3 billion was spent in schools between 2000 and 2006.  There is a commitment for &euro;4.5 billion in the current development plan.  Some 40,000 people are in new primary schools that were built in this period in developing areas, with 45,000 in schools that were refurbished or had classrooms added.  That can continue and therefore there will be a certain degree of offset from the public capital programme for the decline in private sector activity, particularly in the construction business.  That will not totally offset it but we will do all we can, within the resources available to the State, to continue with the capital investment programme that will, in large proportions, remain even with prioritisation that will be necessary in view of the fact that by the end of this year tax revenues will be down by an estimated &euro;6.5 billion compared to last year.  That involves difficulties.</P>
        <P>We must examine our capital programmes, expenditure programmes and tax base to see how we can chart a way forward in the new situation in which we find ourselves.  So long as the global financial and equity markets are in turbulence, we are seeing &mdash; everyone acknowledges and understands it &mdash; the impact it is having on the real economy in terms of business sentiment and business confidence.  These are issues that every country must deal with, including this one, and we intend to do so to the best of our ability.</P>
        <P>It is not a question of business as usual, it is a question of using enterprise supports to identify companies in Ireland that can grow jobs &mdash; some are doing this.  IDA Ireland has been successful in getting investment of over &euro;2.3 billion in the first nine months of 2008, ahead of where it was this time last year.  That is a fair achievement but that is not to say that it will continue unless we continue to work at it and bring forward policies to show that Ireland is open for business, that there is another story to tell in addition to the very difficult situation on the operational day to day side.</P>
        <P>We will begin to address all those issues in the budget as announced by the Minister for Finance when he sets out the budgetary framework.  We will seek, in the first instance, to stabilise the situation and then, in coming years, to see the ways we can address expenditure and grow revenue.  In the meantime we will continue with a significant investment in our public capital programme that will build up the country when the upturn comes.  We will make investments to ensure Ireland is better placed then than now in terms of capital infrastructure and taking up the opportunities that will arise.  That is the challenge and no one suggests it is easy, that there is a quick solution or that anyone has a monopoly on wisdom on how to do it.  Those significant realities must be faced by the Government and the Oireachtas as we consider the budget and the Finance Bill.  In that way, and in no other way, we will chart a way forward.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Is cinnte gur bris ollmh&oacute;r &eacute; a bh&aacute;s d&aacute; chlann.  Bh&iacute; S&eacute;amus an-d&iacute;lis ar fad d&oacute;ibh.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil siad anseo sa Teach linn inniu.  Cuirim mo chomhbhr&oacute;n agus mo chuid taca&iacute;ochta in i&uacute;l d&aacute; ch&eacute;ile Ann, d&aacute; chlann Shay, Daire, Aoife, Breffn&iacute;, S&iacute;ne agus &Eacute;anna, d&aacute; chlann clainne, Calum agus TJ, d&aacute; dhearth&aacute;ireacha, Joe, &Eacute;amon agus Terry agus d&aacute; dheirfi&uacute;r Carmel, chomh maith lena mhuintir agus a ch&aacute;irde ar fad.</P>
        <P>Today we pay tribute to S&eacute;amus Brennan, an exceptional figure in Irish public life.  Across four decades he was at the cutting edge of politics on this island.  His achievements were many and were of enormous consequence.  A man of quiet influence, exuding calm and restless energy, he was driven by a deep desire to serve our country.  He helped shape a more modern, confident and ambitious Ireland.  In the three months since S&eacute;amus Brennan left us, many sincere and well deserved tributes have been paid to him.  I am pleased his family can be with us today to hear the high regard in which he was held by this House.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus graced these corridors for many years and had friends and admirers on all sides of the political spectrum.  Every one of us in politics can take inspiration from his proud career of public service and his immense contribution to our nation&rsquo;s welfare.  His untimely passing, at the age of 60, has been deeply felt across the country.  S&eacute;amus Brennan was a servant of the people.  He will long be remembered in this House and beyond as a brilliant political strategist, a dedicated constituency Deputy, a reforming Minister and a very popular colleague.  He is greatly missed by us all.</P>
        <P>As leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, the party S&eacute;amus loved and served so loyally, I know how deeply felt his passing has been among all sections of our organisation, our parliamentary party, our national executive, in every cumann and in his constituency.  S&eacute;amus Brennan was the quintessential Fianna F&aacute;il organisation person and, dating to his tenure as party general secretary, had a great network of connections within the organisation across the length and breadth of the country.  Throughout his long career, he built up a great knowledge of our party and the personalities that shape it locally and nationally.  He had an enduring respect for the ordinary members of Fianna F&aacute;il for the time and dedication they unselfishly give to politics.  That respect was deeply reciprocated.  Mixed with the sadness that permeated through the ranks of our party on S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s passing, is a real sense of respect and gratitude to a man who did so much to advance the cause of Ireland and her people.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus Brennan&rsquo;s politics were nurtured at a young age and he had deep roots in our party organisation.  His father had been a prominent Fianna F&aacute;il activist and director of elections in Galway.  S&eacute;amus became active in Fianna F&aacute;il as a student and first came to national prominence when he was appointed general secretary of the party in the mid-1970s.  He was the youngest person to hold that office and it was Jack Lynch who made the inspired decision to appoint him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week I spoke in University College Cork at a conference which examined the legacy and achievements of Jack Lynch.  S&eacute;amus Brennan is, of course, indelibly linked to Jack Lynch&rsquo;s greatest electoral triumph.  He deployed the full reservoir of his talents, his great enthusiasm, unrivalled organisational skills and keen political acumen in his role as general secretary.  For S&eacute;amus, the practice of electoral politics was a talent he was born with and when he was given the great responsibility at a young age to plan our party&rsquo;s next phase of development, that talent was put to its fullest use.  He introduced to the election machine modern methods of campaigning, policy formulation and electioneering and played a hugely significant part in our winning the biggest majority in the history of the State at the general election in 1977.</P><Col N="797"/>
        <P>It was Jack Lynch also who appointed S&eacute;amus Brennan to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1977 and set in train a distinguished career in representative politics of which our country has been a major beneficiary.  In 1981 S&eacute;amus successfully contested his first general election and was elected in nine successive elections by the people of Dublin South, frequently topping the poll.  His great commitment to his constituents and to public service made him a formidable vote-gatherer and a great asset to our party.  S&eacute;amus Brennan had keen political acumen and understood better than most the importance of communicating a political message.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a Minister, S&eacute;amus Brennan was a committed public servant in the cause of Ireland.  He was a practical Cabinet colleague who thrived on bringing forward proposed solutions to the challenges his country faced.  He was an able and capable administrator in each of the offices of State that he held.  He first served as Minister of State with responsibility for trade in 1987 before being appointed Minister for Tourism and Transport by Charles Haughey in 1989.  In a long and distinguished ministerial career, he also held ministerial portfolios in education, communications, transport and social and family affairs.  He served with great distinction as Government Chief Whip from 1997 to 2002 and played a significant role in ensuring that Administration completed its full term.  In this role in particular his natural talent for conciliation, accommodation and managing competing pressures served him and the Government of the day very well indeed.</P>
        <P>Throughout his career he consistently showed a deep-seated respect for the views of others.  He understood that persuasion in politics brings unity of purpose and that coercion and conflict can have no place in a civilised society.  He had a practical common sense approach and saw politics as the art of solving problems, not of magnifying them.  He focused on accomplishing tasks and getting the job on hand done.</P>
        <P>At the core of his political philosophy was his belief that a strong economy geared toward maximising employment was the best means by which wider social objectives could be achieved.  As a Minister, his achievements were numerous and of lasting effect.  He established the Forum on Small Business and negotiated significant welfare increases for the most vulnerable in society.  He published a Green Paper on education which placed special emphasis on giving priority to disadvantaged students.  He brought forward many new initiatives in air passenger services.</P>
        <P>I served with S&eacute;amus in the Governments of Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern.  I knew him to be a reforming Minister with a strategic mind and a good grasp of public policy.  Ultimately, he believed in doing the right thing by the country and in using his objective political skills to bring the people with us.  S&eacute;amus played a significant role in shaping the Ireland in which we live today.  I wish to acknowledge also his key role in the negotiations that led to the formation of the current Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party-Progressive Democrat Government with the support of Independent Deputies.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus Brennan was a man of great courtesy.  He faced his illness with considerable dignity and fortitude and never complained.  He continued to work for his constituents in spite of his declining health.  He was a man of commitment, of great insight and of deep patriotism. Ag tabhairt &oacute;r&aacute;id adhlacadh Sh&eacute;amuis dom, d&uacute;irt m&eacute; gur mac d&iacute;lis do chuid cathair na dtreabh ab ea &eacute; &mdash; fear ina raibh an pholaita&iacute;ocht go smior ann.

	<P>Ba mhaith liom cuidi&uacute; leis an r&uacute;n comhbhr&oacute;in at&aacute; molta ag an <?oasys _ch ?>dTaoiseach as ucht b&aacute;is S&eacute;amus &Oacute; Braon&aacute;in.  T&aacute; s&eacute; oiri&uacute;nach go bhfuil a bhean ch&eacute;ile, &Aacute;ine, agus a seisear chlainne anseo sa D&aacute;il inniu.  I outlined the achievements of the late S&eacute;amus <Col N="798"/>Brennan when we spoke in this House following his untimely death.  One of the nice things about this Parliament is that tribute is paid to fallen warriors.  It is a very Irish thing to do.</P>
        <P>I will not outline again the political achievements that are the legacy of S&eacute;amus Brennan, except to say that in my experience over the years he was somebody who was always exceptionally approachable.  He had an extraordinarily warm personality and was never afraid to seek out public representatives in public places, irrespective of the party for which they were elected or of none, in order to make that connection and to show respect for the person whom voters had selected through the ballot box.</P>
        <P Just="Left">S&eacute;amus and I might have been formidable opponents in politics over the years but I would like to thank his widow, Ann, for her courtesy and personal hospitality when I visited Finsbury Park, the Brennan home.  It was nice for a politician to be in the kitchen, to see where the late Minister would have had his breakfast and spoken with his family about issues of political importance and the day&rsquo;s events.  It gave a flavour of that family and, in this case, of Fianna F&aacute;il Cabinet representation.  I say this even though I came under some personal pressure.  When I left the house I was corralled on the street by an over-enthusiastic constituent who had a particular gripe that he wanted to voice to me, vociferously and at length.  In a way that only the wife of a politician could handle and understand Ann despatched from her kitchen a member of her entourage to deal with the matter and I thank her for that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People sometimes assume that Ministers should not be visited by serious illness.  S&eacute;amus Brennan understood that his death was imminent.  We spoke about that, as I have mentioned before.  When this happens to a family, as it has done in many cases in this House, people believe and know it will happen but find it so strange nonetheless.  As the Taoiseach pointed out, S&eacute;amus Brennan bore his illness with great courage and dignity and was an example to anybody else who has a similar terminal illness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In his capacity as public representative, he was an example to anybody who aspires to serve in politics. This was evident in the way he put his priorities, in how he looked after his constituents and tended to their needs as best he could.  He demonstrated the theory of good democratic politics by being able to reflect those concerns, anxieties and difficulties and by sitting at the Cabinet table and having them reflected in legislation.</P>
        <P>Shortly before he died, in the foreword of the booklet for the Bealtaine festival which dealt with elderly people, he wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The vibrant 21st century Ireland we now enjoy has been built on the dedication, sacrifice and vision of generations who are now growing older.  But that is the very reason why older voices and a lifetime&rsquo;s experience have still so much to offer in enriching the arts for all of us to enjoy.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">He had a real feeling for a vein of public life in Ireland that was highly accurate and typical of him.  I will conclude by recalling that a number of years ago, I stood with him in Brennan&rsquo;s Yard in Galway.  It was part of his family connection and he told me it was where he was from, where he began and was what he was.  In commiserating with the Taoiseach and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on the loss of a stalwart member and to Ann Brennan and her family, I note the quiet voice of Galway and Dublin South has been stilled.  However, his spirit and legacy is there for all to see.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Bh&iacute; deis agam cheana c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; anseo faoi Sh&eacute;amus &Oacute; Braon&aacute;in, d&iacute;reach i ndiaidh a bh&aacute;is.  Is mian liom &oacute;m&oacute;s a thabhairt d&oacute; ar&iacute;s, go h&aacute;irithe os rud &eacute; go bhfuil a bhean ch&eacute;ile agus a chlann i l&aacute;thair inniu.</P><Col N="799"/>
        <P>S&eacute;amus Brennan was a hugely significant figure in Irish politics.  He first emerged on the political scene when Jack Lynch had the courage to appoint such a young man as general secretary of Fianna F&aacute;il.  It proved to be an inspired choice as S&eacute;amus Brennan turned out to be an energetic and innovative general secretary, who piloted the modernisation of the Fianna F&aacute;il organisation.  The modernisation and reform of the Fianna F&aacute;il organisation at that time is one reason for the electoral endurance of Fianna F&aacute;il over the last quarter century.</P>
        <P>It was inevitable that such a talented political figure would wish to seek election himself and it was a surprise neither when he stood for the D&aacute;il in Dublin South in 1981 nor when he was elected.  He served with distinction in a wide range of portfolios at both senior and junior ministerial level.  He threw himself into whatever post he held with great enthusiasm.  While he endured some ups and downs as Fianna F&aacute;il leaders came and went, he always managed to hold on and bounce back.  S&eacute;amus Brennan was a man with strong ideas and definite views.  Although the Labour Party sometimes disagreed with those views, he always was prepared to discuss them, listen to alternative viewpoints and to have a calm and rational discussion.</P>
        <P>Modern politics can be a rough and sometimes brutal business but there was never a nasty word or phrase from S&eacute;amus Brennan.  He was the essential political gentleman.  He was a long-serving Government Chief Whip, which is never the easiest of jobs, and often, particularly in the circumstances in which he served, is an especially difficult one.  It was in this capacity that the Opposition had most dealings with him.  All those in the Labour Party who dealt with S&eacute;amus Brennan as Minister and as Whip found him to be a man of exceptional courtesy and consideration.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus was particularly dedicated to the people of Dublin South, who rewarded that dedication by returning him at election after election with a huge vote.  It was a remarkable achievement to have been elected for Dublin South in nine successive general elections and I cannot recall any occasion when he was regarded as being in electoral trouble.  S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s constituency and mine are neighbours and our paths regularly crossed.  I recall telling the House on a previous occasion of a time when I inherited some election workers from him.  I had the opposite experience on the day of his funeral because as I left the church, I met some people I had not seen for a while and to whom I had given assistance at various times, such as getting them housed in Ballyogan, Ballyboden and various places in S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s constituency.  While they were delighted to see me at the funeral, they made it clear to me that their allegiance had shifted solidly to S&eacute;amus in their new constituency.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus and I both are from Galway and we often discussed matters relating to Galway together, such as Galway hurling, football, people or politics.  The last time I met S&eacute;amus socially was at an event in NUIG, at which the university gave him an award of which he was very proud.  He endured his illness with characteristic courage and dignity and on behalf of the Labour Party, I wish to extend my sympathies to Ann, their children and to all his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.

	<P>It seems to me that I grew up with S&eacute;amus Brennan.  I remember in the 1970s watching &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; and seeing him appear on it, almost like a character from an American movie like &ldquo;All the President&rsquo;s Men&rdquo;.  He had the collar, tie, sideburns and hair to go with modern times and modern politics.  I grew into political consciousness during the election of 1977, when all the razzmatazz and colour came from some of S&eacute;amus Brennan&rsquo;s thinking.</P>
        <P>I remember growing up and seeing him appear on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; in the 1980s.  It seemed to me as though he was one of the central characters in the tossing around outside the gates of Leinster House, as people came and went with great dilemmas as to what course of action or direction they would take regarding party loyalties.  I recall Deputy John Gormley telling <Col N="800"/>me in the 1990s, as he worked in opposition with S&eacute;amus Brennan as the Whip when the Green Party first came into the D&aacute;il as a party, of what an honourable man and easy person he was to work with.</P>
        <P>I only came to know S&eacute;amus Brennan face to face in the election of 2002, when I learned a lesson or two about some of those skills and political communication.  He produced a leaflet during that election that demonstrated all his expertise and brilliance in political communication.  It consisted of a satellite picture of the constituency showing every house in such detail that one could see one&rsquo;s own house.  Dots on the map marked everything that had been done by the Administration with which S&eacute;amus had been involved for the previous five years and it constituted a brilliant piece of political communication because it was personal, simple and highly effective.</P>
        <P>He had a highly effective team around him at all times.  As an Opposition spokesperson, one would meet Bobby Holland, Frank Lahiffe or others at constituency meetings and one often would be obliged to take a step backwards as the healthy rivalry within the Fianna F&aacute;il camp left little space for opposition.  However, he himself, at all times, was an utter gentleman to deal with.  I was an Opposition spokesperson engaged in the chess game of trying to catch him out as a Minister.  However, this was not easy and he rarely was caught out.  While he was gentlemanly and accurate, he also was a superb politician in terms of maintaining calm and intelligence in the midst of whatever frantic questioning was thrown at him.</P>
        <P>I saw him in recent years on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; as a Minister and in Cabinet, where he showed an incredible calm collected wisdom, even in what must have been incredibly difficult times for him as his illness progressed.  He will be a huge loss to Fianna F&aacute;il and also I believe will be a loss to the Government in turbulent times as all could benefit from such calm confidence and ability.  Above all else, his loss must be terrible for his family.  I remember that on starting out at that 2002 election, I told myself that as I have known S&eacute;amus Brennan for 30 years on television, he must be about to retire.  I recall looking at his date of birth in <i>Nealon&rsquo;s Guide</i> and getting a shock on learning he still was a young man.  His premature loss must be truly terrible for his family and our sympathies in the Green Party are with them today.</P>

On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in representatives in the Houses of the Oireachtas, I wish to extend our sympathy to the wife and family of the late S&eacute;amus Brennan.  May he rest in peace.  Like other speakers, my first experience of S&eacute;amus took place 11 years ago, when I became the first and sole Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy to participate in the modern D&aacute;il.  During my five years of solitary responsibility, I had many occasions on which to engage with S&eacute;amus as Chief Whip.  He always was courteous, affable and highly importantly, always a man of his word.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also important to state he was a facilitator.  Part of his role as Chief Whip was to deal with a number of Deputies from smaller parties of the time and Independents, and he regularly faced the questions, challenges and issues we brought forward.  At all times he approached these matters &mdash; some were challenges and others were new issues arising from the new make-up of the 28th D&aacute;il &mdash; with a &ldquo;can do&rdquo; point of view.  I always appreciated that.  There was never a direct rejection or a &ldquo;No&rdquo; but rather a &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we can do&rdquo;.  As a lone representative of my party over those years, I appreciated that and I wish to record my thanks to him for the way he approached each of the matters I raised.</P>
        <P>I extend our sympathy to An Taoiseach and members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, which has lost a very valued and much-appreciated colleague.  I also extend sympathy to all of S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s family and extended family.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>I join the Taoiseach and other party representatives in expressing my sympathy to Ann Brennan and her family &mdash; Daire, Sine, Aoife, Breffni, Shay and &Eacute;anna.</P>
        <P>The death of S&eacute;amus Brennan on 9 July saddened us all.  The death of a young man, aged just 60, who had only retired from Cabinet two months earlier, was something none of us was quite ready for.  In the three months since his death, it is still hard to believe he is not among us.  When we returned after the summer break, one would have imagined seeing S&eacute;amus Brennan again because he had been in this House for the past 31 years.</P>
        <P>I first got to know S&eacute;amus Brennan when I was a very young student in Trinity College.  He was very encouraging to young people.  When I was around 21 he said to me that I should aspire to being a candidate in the upcoming election in 1977.  Needless to say that was not top of my agenda and nor did I think it was even a possibility.  In 1977, he called me and left a message &mdash; this was before the mobile phone era &mdash; and when I rang him he told me I was to run in Dublin South-East.</P>
        <P>For somebody who, like Deputy Gilmore and S&eacute;amus Brennan, had west of Ireland origins but had grown up in west Dublin, Dublin South-East was a foreign territory.  I asked him where it was and he told me it took in Donnybrook, Ballsbridge and Goatstown.  I said I did not know anybody there and nobody would vote for me.  He said he and his wife would vote for me so I had at least two votes.  Off I went with my two votes &mdash; in the end I think I got 1,599, not even making 1,600.</P>
        <P>Since then I was very friendly with S&eacute;amus.  Right from the start he and Ann were a formidable political pair.  There were two politicians in that house and part of S&eacute;amus Brennan&rsquo;s success was the enormous political insight, talent and skill of his wife.  The story recalled by Deputy Kenny about when he was being politically assaulted in Finsbury Park shows that only somebody like Ann Brennan would have the wherewithal to come to the Deputy&rsquo;s rescue.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is often said that death is not the greatest loss &mdash; the greatest loss is what dies inside us as we live.  For the Brennan family, their loss is absolutely immense.  As S&eacute;amus went through his illness he was partly in denial but more than anything else, he was determined to get better.  He did not become a victim to his illness.  As he sat around the Cabinet table with his colleagues we could occasionally observe that he was not well, but he was as determined and focused as ever.  He made the usual sensible contributions to a variety of issues, not just those which affected his Department.</P>
        <P>When S&eacute;amus went from an economic Ministry to social welfare, many wondered how he would cope.  He was passionate about the economy and had a significant interest in economic matters, particularly those related to transport.  He took on the cause of the less well-off in our society with a passion and commitment that was truly remarkable.  It was hard to believe he had not spent his life in that Department.  He gave everything to every job he had.</P>
        <P>Above all else, he will be remembered for the Luas.  I remember when we were in the Seanad sometime between 1977 and 1979, he spoke about opening the Harcourt Street line.  I admit I thought it was a daft notion.  I know in the intervening years there were many detractors and opponents when the project was in planning and under construction but today it is a treasure.  It is ironic yet fitting that he should be buried in the shadow of the bridge in Dundrum, in St. Nahi&rsquo;s cemetery.  S&eacute;amus could not have wished for more.</P>
        <P>Aside from the Luas and transport issues being a permanent memory to him, he was a great political organiser.  I remember when he went to America for the Carter and Ford election contest in 1976 and came back with all the razzmatazz, such as the song &ldquo;Your Kind of Country&rdquo;, t-shirts and so on.  Many of us wore them at the time, believe it or not.  I wonder what he would bring back if he was in America today, observing the contest between Obama and Biden <Col N="802"/>on one side and McCain and Palin on the other.  He would probably e-mail hockey clubs looking for a supermum or send a personalised message to &ldquo;Joe Six-Pack&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus was not just a political machine and he had a great personal touch.  I remember just before the last election one of my advisers, who lives in Dublin South, got a wonderful personal message thanking him for all his work for the Government and wishing him and his wife all the best.  S&eacute;amus did not ask for a vote.  We were impressed because we knew S&eacute;amus must have at least suspected he would not get the number one vote but he did not ask for any vote.  He got a very high preference as a result.  About two days later somebody else who works for me received a different personal message.  That was a not a political machine at work; there was a unique personal touch in it.</P>
        <P>Many people have spoken about his dignity and calmness.  He never used personal invective in political debate as he did not think it had any role in the political process.  That is the reason he genuinely got on so well with everybody in persuading people.</P>
        <P>I remarked very early in my career on his capacity to get great publicity for what were sometimes very minor stories.  It was not unusual to pick up a Sunday broadsheet with a headline about something that did not seem, in the grand scheme of things, to be worthy but S&eacute;amus was a master at communicating a message, either directly or indirectly through the print media.  He was a very formidable political opponent.</P>
        <P>Ann and the family are deeply grateful for the significant support received from S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s doctors, particularly his general practitioner, Dr. Michael Meehan, Dr. Fennelly and his team and Dr. Frank Sullivan.  I know Ann would like this mentioned because both she and S&eacute;amus were eternally grateful for the wonderful care that he received.</P>
        <P>They say true dignity is not gained by place nor lost when honours are withdrawn.  S&eacute;amus Brennan had dignity, calmness, friendship and a huge pride in his family.  Notwithstanding how busy he was, his family brought him great pride and he gave much time to them.  As each of his children grew up, he was immensely proud of their achievements.</P>
        <P>He is a huge loss to Ann and her family, as well as to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  He was deeply committed to Fianna F&aacute;il and as I stated here on the morning of his passing, I know this because I tried to get him to leave on a couple of occasions without any success.  He is a great loss because he had great insights into how people thought, how things might work and how to sell political messages.  That is why he was so popular not just in his own constituency, but throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I rise to pay tribute to my constituency colleague, S&eacute;amus Brennan, with the feeling still of disbelief that a man central to national and party politics, and with whom I worked so closely for so many years, is no longer with us.  I extend my deepest sympathy to Ann, Shay, Daire, Aoife, Breffni, Sine and &Eacute;anna.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus and I were part and parcel of each other&rsquo;s lives for almost 30 years.  I was a newly-elected Fianna F&aacute;il councillor when S&eacute;amus first arrived to run and get elected in the 1981 general election in Dublin South.  At the time, it was a crowded constituency on the Fianna F&aacute;il side.  Colleagues such as the late Niall Andrews, the late Ruair&iacute; Brugha and S&iacute;le de Valera, who later returned to County Clare, were all active and involved.  S&eacute;amus Brennan was a true professional who was greatly respected and loved by his constituents.  The fact that he was always known to them as S&eacute;amus speaks for itself.</P>
        <P>Dublin South is not a constituency for the faint-hearted and over the years its electorate dealt a cruel blow to many high profile names.  As general secretary of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, <Col N="803"/>S&eacute;amus Brennan showed considerable organisational and communications skills which he brought to bear working diligently and meticulously for his constituents.</P>
        <P>Constituency rivalries among party colleagues are part and parcel of folklore in this House.  One former colleague from this side, Mr. Michael Smith who represented Tipperary North, often compared his rivalry with his colleague, Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Kennedy, as like playing ground hurling without the sliotar.  While we may not have as many sliotars or hurleys in Dublin South, S&eacute;amus and I campaigned hard.  As the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said we competed for every vote at election time while at all times respecting each other.  Other speakers referred to S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s courtesy.  He was always courteous to my supporters and me and when the votes were counted and the results emerged, we got on with working together and representing our constituency.</P>
        <P>In analysing how S&eacute;amus and I always secured a decent vote throughout the past 21 years, it is clear we had much in common, even though we had different ideological perspectives at times.  We were both Galway men who worked hard, took nothing for granted and had unflinching support from immediate and extended family and friends.  I acknowledge the tremendous support S&eacute;amus had from his frontline team of Mary Browne, Frank Lahiffe and Bobby Holland.  There are many cross-family friendships on both the Brennan and Kitt sides.</P>
        <P>Canvassing from door to door, my canvass team became adept at recognising who would secure the number one vote.  The words, &ldquo;We will look after S&eacute;amus and yourself, Tom&rdquo;, meant another number one for S&eacute;amus.  I often joked with S&eacute;amus that one always knew there was no vote for either of us when the fellow with folded arms in the doorway of a house shouted the words, &ldquo;Best of luck, anyway&rdquo;, as I made my exit along his driveway.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus Brennan left us at a young age and was only one year older than my late father when he died in politics in the mid-1970s.  S&eacute;amus had much still to give to political life.  His family can be proud of his many achievements in government, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and his constituency, having started his political life at such an early age.  As the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated, S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s final resting place is in St. Nahi&rsquo;s Cemetery, Dundrum, in the shadows of the magnificent Luas bridge.  S&eacute;amus was rightly proud of his role in bringing the Luas to Dundrum and south Dublin and that achievement is a legacy of his approach to politics, which was about getting things done and making a difference.</P>
        <P>The death of S&eacute;amus Brennan is a huge loss to his family and the country.  He is missed in a special way, as I have been reminded many times in recent weeks and months, by his constituents in Dublin South.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, express my sympathy to S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s wife, Ann, his children and his extended family.  While it is always heartbreaking to lose a close family member, it is particularly tragic to lose so suddenly someone so young and in the prime of his life.  Although S&eacute;amus was sick for a long time, the end came too quickly.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus gave virtually all his adult life to public service and was reaching the stage in life when he could reasonably look forward to having more time to spend with his family, enjoying his grandchildren, playing golf and enjoying personal time which is not available to Cabinet members or anybody involved in political life.  That he was not afforded those years is a tragedy and must be a source of huge regret and sadness to his family.</P>
        <P>The last time I saw S&eacute;amus was a few weeks before he died when he visited Dundrum town centre to support the Taoiseach who was canvassing for the Lisbon treaty referendum.  I will never forget the strain on his face that day.  Clearly, the day was taking a huge toll on him and costing him an enormous effort.  Although it was heartbreaking to see him, at the same time it was a measure of the man and his sense of loyalty to the Taoiseach, his party and the country, <Col N="804"/>as well as the many Fianna F&aacute;il supporters who were present on the day, that he would turn up for what must have been his final public occasion.</P>
        <P>Much has been said about S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s political career on the national stage as a Minister who held many portfolios, a household name and an adept and polished television performer.  I knew him best as a constituency colleague and for virtually all my time in politics he was the political colossus in Dublin South.  As we all know, he was not a big man but he had stature in the constituency.  Through his actions and in his demeanour, his constituents on whose behalf he worked tirelessly knew he was on their side.  No meeting was too small and no topic too insignificant for him to bother about.  He followed up every problem relentlessly.  It was a source of jest in Dublin South that one should be wary of contacting S&eacute;amus because when one&rsquo;s name entered his database, it was never removed.  As the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, noted, one was assured of a lifetime of correspondence.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s election canvassing machine was legendary and moved inexorably across the constituency.  It was feared by the rest of us in much the same way as a panzer division must have been feared.  The Brennan team was a sight to behold and instantly recognisable by the presence of his beautiful, red-head daughters who turned out in election after election to support their dad.  Every time we met on the hustings it was obvious how proud they were of their father, how devoted they were to him and how proud he was of them.</P>
        <P>I do not know if the Brennan team will march again in Dublin South but if not, they will be missed for their colourful presence.  From childhood on and in successive elections, S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s children provided living testimony to the filial devotion all public representatives need to succeed.  At constituency level, S&eacute;amus was a formidable, awesome and frustrating adversary at public meetings because his manner was so non-confrontational, reasonable and self-deprecating that he completely disarmed his critics.  No matter how irate the constituent, he managed to bring peace where there was disharmony.  It was a sobering experience to observe how he trumped the rest of us at public meetings.  If he could not promise to meet the demands of those present, he promised the next best thing, namely, a meeting with the Minister in Leinster House.  This always went down well as all was forgiven and people left the meeting quietly.  The rest of us could not compete with him.</P>
        <P>People liked and respected S&eacute;amus because he respected them.  Many people from all parties expressed genuine sadness at his untimely demise and everybody spoke of the dignity he maintained to the end as well as the gentlemanly manner he displayed in all his dealings with friends and foe.  S&eacute;amus is missed in Leinster House, in the Government and in the constituency, but the real sadness is felt by Ann and the Brennan family as they try to come to terms with the great loss they have experienced.  I offer them my heartfelt sympathy.</P>

	<P>I wish to be associated with all the tributes that have been paid.  In particular, as I have previously done, I express my sympathy to Ann, Shay, Daire, Aoife, Sine, Breffni, &Eacute;anna and the extended Brennan family.  While today must be a sad day for the family, I hope it is also a proud day.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus and I entered the D&aacute;il on the same day in 1981, which now seems like an entirely different age.  Dublin South was represented at the time by S&eacute;amus and me, the late Niall Andrews, the late John Kelly and Nuala Fennell.  To some extent, it is strange that I find myself here while S&eacute;amus is no longer with us.</P>
        <P>Often we say things about those who have passed on which are not completely sincere, but everything that has been said about S&eacute;amus today is true and reflects S&eacute;amus as a man, a politician and a constituency colleague.</P><Col N="805"/>
        <P>Over the years when we locked horns or trailed around the constituency from meeting to meeting after each other, I cannot recall a single incident or event, be it at a public meeting, at election time or even in this House, when there was a political charge across the House or a cross word expressed by S&eacute;amus in my direction.  I hope, in the context of my conduct, I behaved similarly towards him.</P>
        <P>As a constituency rival, he was a completely trustworthy individual.  If he told one something about an issue, and from his perspective as a Minister, it was always true.  He never set out to mislead or embarrass those from different parties who were on platforms with him.  He had a unique capacity, when delivering bad news, either at a public meeting or to a group he met in this House, to leave them with a ray of hope that whatever cause they were championing would ultimately be successful.  That said something about his capacity as a politician.  On occasions in the context of Dublin South he had to deliver bad news, be it about a new school or a school extension, but he always assured people he was still fighting for them.  The fight was continued and frequently as the years passed the project that appeared hopeless was ultimately delivered.  I like to think that my giving him some grief in this House on occasions contributed to him, as a Minister, being able to put pressure on colleagues to do things that were necessary for people in south Dublin.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus and I on occasion shared constituents who had problems, which I am sure is no different from what happens in other constituencies.  On the odd occasion we had discussions about individuals who seemed to have a need to visit myself and S&eacute;amus, and also probably Deputies Tom Kitt and Olivia Mitchell in recent years.  My one regret is that I never checked out with him one individual who felt the need to visit my constituency clinic on a regular basis in the late 1980s and early 1990s to report the number of public light bulbs that had given up the ghost in Dublin South and needed replacing.  After the first two or three visits I thought he was trying to be helpful, but as the visits strayed into months, he seemed to feel the need to visit every street in the Rathfarnham area to identify a light bulb that was dysfunctional.  This resulted in correspondence to this gentleman assuring him the matter was being followed up, with correspondence back from the county council assuring me the bulb would be replaced.  Sadly, I never checked with S&eacute;amus whether he had the same light bulb problem.  There were other constituents like that whom we shared on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus was a soft-spoken individual, whether it was in this House or at meetings, but he was authoritative.  He had a way about him that reassured people.  He took that approach in this House and with the media and, as a consequence, people developed enormous affection for him.</P>
        <P>He also had a great capacity to read elections and not only to organise them.  S&eacute;amus used to know the likely outcome of a general election two or three weeks before it was called and had a pretty accurate view of it at least a week before polling day.  In the 2007 general election when he was obviously unwell but still striving to get elected, we managed to stand beside each other outside Rathfarnham Church one Sunday morning as people exited from it.  We stood side by side shaking hands with and greeting people, both hoping we would get their electoral support.  I still remember that as the last person exited and we both moved off to meet again about ten minutes later outside another church gate, S&eacute;amus stopped to say to me, &ldquo;Alan, I&rsquo;ve done the sums; I&rsquo;ve no doubt you&rsquo;re going to get elected.&rdquo;  There is no politician in this House who believes he will be elected until the last vote has been counted.  My wife said to me, &ldquo;S&eacute;amus is never wrong about elections.&rdquo;  She found that took the pressure off during the last few days of that campaign.</P><Col N="806"/>
        <P>It is fair to say that in this House on occasions the hard word passes across the benches far too frequently.  In the case of S&eacute;amus that never occurred.  He is a great loss to this House and to Dublin South.  I wish his family well.  I wish Ann well.  May he rest in peace.</P>

	<P>I seek to move the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the threat to students and their parents posed by the Government&rsquo;s decision to make substantial increases in registration charges for third level courses, which will create a barrier to access, and is nothing less than the introduction of fees by stealth.</P>

	<P>I was going to ask the Taoiseach if the explosives Bill would be introduced next week, but perhaps I will not do so.  In view of the fact that the guarantee for the financial institutions has not yet been approved by the Government, does the Taoiseach expect it to be laid before the House on Thursday or will that happen next week?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify the position on the proposed referendum on children&rsquo;s rights, particularly in the context of statutory rape?  I understand the Government will not be making a report to the relevant committee but that the members of Fianna F&aacute;il who serve on the committee will do so.  I do not know whether their report will be made on behalf of their entire party.  Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to have the committee complete its work or is he intent on following through on the commitment in the programme for Government regarding holding a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The position on the second matter to which the Deputy refers is to see whether a consensus can emerge from the committee on the best way to proceed.  Fianna F&aacute;il members on the committee have brought forward a substantial submission in an attempt to assist in that effort to build a consensus.  However, as the Leader of the Opposition stated, the Government has not yet come to a conclusion on the matter and is waiting to see whether the committee can arrive at an agreed way forward.</P>
        <P>The scheme relating to the financial guarantee will be brought before the House as soon as possible and practicable.  Deputy Kenny will be aware that the Minister for Finance is attending an ECOFIN meeting today, that he attended a Eurogroup meeting and that he met the EU Competition Commissioner last night.  The Minister had a very constructive meeting with the Commissioner.  What he is doing is informing the preparation, which is at an advanced stage, of the scheme and the framework being drafted.  Based on the briefing issued on foot of these meetings, an effort is being made to examine ways we can assist in dealing with any queries the European Commission may wish to raise in order to address all of the matters outstanding.</P><Col N="808"/>
        <P>Institutions outside the six named banks may wish to make applications to be covered under the scheme.  We will give consideration to those applications but we cannot reach conclusions in respect of them until we identify the terms and conditions that will apply to such institutions and then discover whether they wish to proceed on the basis of agreeing to those terms and conditions.  The situation is evolving.  We are trying to obtain and provide a complete picture.</P>

	<P>Hopefully.  I will be meeting the Minister for Finance on his return in order to obtain an update briefing on where matters stand regarding the preparation of the scheme.  I understand preparation of the scheme has been ongoing over the weekend.  Developments have been made as a result of the meetings that took place.  An attempt is being made to finalise the scheme in a way that it will, if possible, satisfy everyone.  That is what we are trying to do.  I will probably be in a better position tomorrow to indicate what might be the likely timeline.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When the legislation was debated last week, the Minister for Finance informed Members that the scheme would be brought before the House this week.  It appears from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply that matters are beginning to drift.  When does the Taoiseach expect the scheme to be finalised and brought before the House?  Have any of the financial institutions concerned been involved in the discussions taking place on the content of the scheme?  When it is brought forward by the Government, will the scheme be open to amendment by the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>What is being considered is bringing forward the scheme and laying it before the Houses of the Oireachtas for discussion in order that people might give their views on it.  I will be obliged to discuss with the Minister for Finance what will be the exact mechanics of the process.  I am aware that he sought to provide an assurance that the scheme would be brought before the House this week.  However, we want to get it right and deal with any emerging issues.  As the Deputy is aware, this is an evolving situation.  Many meetings took place in Europe at the weekend, the Eurogroup met last night and ECOFIN met today.  The Minister is returning home from these meetings this evening and I will discuss the matter with him at that stage.  I will be in a position tomorrow morning to update the House on precisely where matters stand.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister is introducing the scheme which was the subject of the Labour Party&rsquo;s first amendment on Committee Stage.  However, a difficulty arises.  Will the Opposition be briefed on a regular basis, particularly if implementation of the scheme is delayed?  There are a number of serious and pressing questions.  For example, has the Financial Regulator yet been empowered to increase supervision in respect of the applicant banks?  Is there any protection for the economy in respect of the flow of &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; and other assets into this jurisdiction from those seeking to avail of the guarantee?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the first instance, the Minister for Finance must be given an opportunity to brief me and the Government on the up-to-date position.  We will then be obliged to take account of the various emerging and evolving issues.  It is important that we get this matter right.  In getting it right we must take into account whatever views are expressed at various fora.  We must also show our co-operative spirit and make efforts to see if we can, to the greatest extent possible, address any concerns or issues being raised.  The Government must give careful consideration to these matters.  When they have been considered, we will proceed to finalising the terms and conditions of the scheme.  The best I can do at this stage is to say I will be discussing the matter with the Minister later this evening.  I will be in a better position to deal more comprehensively with the issue tomorrow morning.  At this point, I can only provide Members with the information I have to hand.</P>

This new policy is to involve a comprehensive <Col N="812"/>review of service delivery, manpower planning and training and the regulation of the dental profession in Ireland.  It will make wide-ranging recommendations on oral health policy for the next ten years.  It was originally envisaged that the policy would be finalised by the middle of this year, but the timeline has been extended, at least to the end of the year, given the complexity and range of issues involved and to facilitate the widest possible consultation with the various stakeholders.  It is envisaged that the policy will make clear recommendations on the need for a new regulatory regime for the profession in Ireland, the establishment of a new dental council and the development of a new dentists Bill to give effect to these changes.  For these reasons, the dental Bill will not be taken until that policy input is assessed and agreed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill 2008.  I welcome the legislation which is overdue.  We have introduced legislation to impose independent regulatory supervision in many areas and it is only right that we do the same in the legal services sector.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the appointment of a legal services ombudsman by the Government.  I warmly welcome the stipulation that the person appointed may not be a practising barrister or solicitor.  Similar provisions have been put in place in England and other jurisdictions.  I am glad that the initial appointment will be made for a period of six years.  While the appointment is renewable, it has to be reviewed at the end of six years.  This stipulation which has been applied throughout the public sector helps to increase people&rsquo;s awareness of their responsibilities because they can and will be moved on if they do not perform adequately.</P>
        <P>The functions of the ombudsman will be to receive and investigate the handling of complaints by the Law Society or the Bar Council, review the procedures of both bodies for dealing with complaints, assess the adequacy of the admission policies of the Law Society and the Bar Council to the professions of solicitor and barrister, respectively, and promote awareness among members of the public of matters pertaining to the procedures of these bodies for addressing complaints.</P>
        <P>I will concentrate my comments on solicitors rather than barristers because, in my experience as a public representative, I have received more complaints about the former.  People are more likely to engage a solicitor than a barrister.</P>
        <P>Complaints can be made on grounds of inadequate service, excessive fees or misconduct.  A claim must be made within five years of the occurrence of the problem.  A complaint can be made directly to the Law Society or the solicitor&rsquo;s disciplinary tribunal.  If the complainant is not satisfied with the way the complaint is addressed, he or she can bring the matter to the independent adjudicator who, while not connected to the legal profession, is appointed by the Law Society.  This reveals a flaw in the current system in that there is a connection between the adjudicator and the Law Society.  This legislation will remove that flaw by transferring these functions to the legal services ombudsman.</P>
        <P>I have never accepted the way in which the profession is regulated because, in my experience, complaints have not been taken seriously enough.  People have approached me about particular <Col N="816"/>solicitors or cases after experiencing difficulties in finding alternative solicitors to pursue their grievances.  The Law Society has stated it cannot deal with complaints of negligence but that if, for example, a solicitor has failed to process a case, draw up or serve documents or take out probate to a will in a timely manner with the result that the client has suffered a loss, a court action may be taken.  It has further stated it maintains on its website a list of solicitors who are prepared to take on cases of negligence.  However, it has been my experience that people have found it difficult to hire a solicitor to pursue such cases.</P>
        <P>When an investigation was commenced by the Law Society, it was often of an innocuous nature or insufficiently robust.  I acknowledge that matters may have changed in the light of the high profile cases involving solicitors being struck off the register.  Allegations are being taken more seriously because of the damage wrought to the profession by these cases.</P>
        <P>A good friend of mine was fond of asking the question: &ldquo;Who guards the guardians?&rdquo;  That question was first put by Plato to Socrates and the answer was that they would guard themselves against themselves.  That is the answer on which we have relied in this and many other areas but the situation is now changing in regard to the legal profession.</P>
        <P>In the context of our discussions on amalgamating State agencies, I am concerned that we might be creating another layer of bureaucracy in the legal services ombudsman.  Perhaps the functions could be placed within the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman through the establishment of a legal services division.  However, section 19 of the Bill provides that the Law Society and the Bar Council will each be responsible for 10% of the costs, with the balance to be met by either body based on the caseload involved.  This would seem to suggest the legislation is Exchequer-neutral.  If that were the case I would not have a problem with the setting up of a separate office.  That is something the Minister might clarify when he speaks later.  The Minister might also clarify whether this legislation gives us the power to force these bodies to make payments and what we can do to make sure they pay.</P>
     
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I wonder how large the office of the legal services ombudsman will be.  For example, the Office of the Legal Services Ombudsman for England and Wales consists of 25 people.  How long will it have to deal with a particular complaint?  Should we include an aspiration that, in the absence of certain difficulties or problems, a report should be furnished within four, six or eight months?  I have no hang-up about the particular time, but a timescale should be specified.  We have one, for instance, for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is supposed to make a decision within a four-month period, although we all know it never does.  Perhaps something could be stitched into the legislation to tighten things up so we do not find ourselves waiting years for a report from this office.</P>
        <P>Judges do not appear to be any part of this Bill.  I am often concerned about the conduct of some judges.  I am aware of the separation of powers of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary, which we must be careful to maintain.  However, I wonder whether the legal services ombudsman could have a role to play in this regard.  My biggest gripe is the inconsistency of sentencing.  A District Court judge in Waterford could make a decision on a particular case, and the same case could be going on before another judge in Donegal, but the two sentences could be totally at variance with one another.  This is part of the reason victims of crime are not happy with what is happening within our courts system.  I wonder whether the legal services ombudsman could act as a vehicle for complaints they may have.  There could be a role for this new office in the creation of a database of sentencing, which might let us see what different judges are doing in different parts of the country.  I assume this is not something that is being done by anybody at present.  This information would be useful to all of us.  I remember a judge saying that at the end of the day judges must implement the will of the Oireachtas.  I do not think this is happening at present.  This might serve to make them a little more accountable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill 2008.  In light of recent events it is topical, relevant and above all good for citizens, taxpayers and consumers.  We need the right calibre of person for the job, which is a very important position.  It is not acceptable, as we have seen in recent times, for some bankers, solicitors and others in the legal profession to damage the integrity of their position.  This legislation, as far as I am concerned, is about justice, fair play and equality.  These are the issues that must be at the heart of the Bill.</P>
        <P>In recent years the State has been damaged by sleaze and corruption in all aspects of Irish life.  Politics, business, the church and the legal profession have all been seriously damaged and we should admit this to the public.  The public want change and they want action, but above all they want reform.  This Bill is part of the agenda of reform.  Members of the legal profession, many of whom I meet regularly, are embarrassed by and ashamed of the activities of some of their own members.  This is at the heart of the debate today.  I urge the Minister to put the boot into rogue solicitors and bad practice in the legal profession.  This is something that people of integrity who work in the legal profession, particularly those with great records on human rights and citizens&rsquo; rights, are calling out for.  They want support and they want this legislation to deal with the issue.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish on a statutory basis the office of the legal services ombudsman to oversee the handling of complaints by the Bar Council and the Law Society, review the procedures for same and report annually on the adequacy of the admissions policies of both professions.  Section 4 provides for the establishment of the office of legal services ombudsman.  Section 5 stipulates that the legal services ombudsman shall be appointed by the Government and that the person appointed shall be suitably qualified, and provides for the classes of person not eligible for appointment as ombudsman.  This is a sensible section.  I urge the Government to ensure that the right calibre of person is appointed to this position.</P>
        <P>Section 6 sets the period of office at a maximum of six years, allows re-appointment for a second or subsequent term and provides for the manner in which the ombudsman may resign from office.  It also provides for the circumstances in which the Government may remove the ombudsman from office as well as the circumstances in which a person ceases to hold the office of legal services ombudsman.  Section 7 provides for terms and conditions relating to remuneration of the ombudsman.</P>
        <P>I welcome section 8, which is a strong section.  It restricts the ombudsman from engaging in other paid employment unless approved by the Minister.  This is a sensible measure because the ombudsman must focus on his or her job in the interests of consumers, taxpayers and, above all, citizens.  Section 8 ensures that the person chosen will focus on his or her position.  Section 9 provides that the functions of the legal services ombudsman are to receive and investigate complaints about the handling by the Law Society and the Bar Council of complaints made to them by clients of barristers and solicitors, to ensure that such complaints are dealt with fairly, effectively and efficiently by the two professional bodies, to assess the adequacy of <Col N="818"/>their admissions policies and to promote public awareness of the complaints procedures of the two bodies.  This is also important.  We must protect the interest of clients and citizens.</P>
        <P>Section 10 stipulates that the ombudsman shall be independent in the performance of the functions of the office.  This is an important section, because the independence of the ombudsman is a key aspect of the legislation.  As an Independent Member of the Oireachtas I must point out that in the upcoming budget it is important that the Government focuses on certain issues.  There should be no cuts in areas such as cystic fibrosis, disabilities or health.  I mention these because I want to put down a marker in this debate for the broader discussion about the budget in next few days.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides for the ombudsman to appoint staff and set their terms and conditions of employment, subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance and following consultation with the Bar Council and the Law Society.  The ombudsman may, subject to the consent of the Minister, engage the services of advisers or consultants and may also authorise members of the staff to perform certain functions.  I urge caution on section 11 when dealing with the area of consultants, on which the public is demanding action.  We do not want to see any more waste of public money on the employment of consultants.  I urge the people directly involved, including the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is present, to be wary of this section.  We need to be very conscious of cost and ensure we do not waste money.  It is the priority of the State for the next six to 12 months that money be well spent.</P>
        <P>Section 12 provides for the Minister to advance to the ombudsman out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas amounts as the Minister may determine, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, for the purposes of performing his or her functions.  The Minister for Finance has a significant input into this section also.  Section 13 provides for financial accounting and audit matters including presentation of audited accounts to the Minister and their laying before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This section is important as it deals with the accounting and auditing issue.  Section 13 delivers on the issue of accountability.</P>
        <P>Sections 14 and 15 provide for various reports to be made by the ombudsman, including an annual report to the Minister on the performance of the functions of the office, a report to the Minister within two years of being appointed on the effectiveness of the office and the adequacy of its functions, special reports on matters of particular gravity or in other exceptional circumstances and an annual report to the Minister on the adequacy of the admissions policies of the legal professions.  Each of these reports shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published.  Sections 14 and 15 are key.  However, presenting the report to the Minister within two years of appointment may be too long and could be reduced.</P>
        <P>Sections 16 provides for the appearance of the ombudsman before a committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann regarding its accounts and such matters as its efficiency and any other matter raised in a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This section is important as it zooms in on accountability.  In recent days with the financial crisis and the major rows in the United States, I have been very impressed with its Congress committees that have hauled in some of these bankers, particularly those involved in Lehman Brothers, to give account to the representatives of the people.  An Oireachtas committee has a role to play in this issue.</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the Bill dealing with complaints and reviews gets to the heart of the matter.  Sections 21 and 22 provide for the making and investigation of complaints.  A complaint may be made to the ombudsman concerning the handling by the Bar Council of Ireland or the Law Society of Ireland of a complaint against a barrister or solicitor.  A complaint may also be made to the ombudsman about a decision of the Law Society of Ireland to make or refuse a grant from the Law Society of Ireland&rsquo;s compensation fund.  Complaints to the ombudsman must be made <Col N="819"/>within six months of the determination of the related complaint by the relevant body.  The circumstances in which a person is not entitled to make a complaint are also provided for.  We need to focus on the issue of complaints and ensure our citizens and taxpayers are at the heart of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the debate and the legislation.  This is an opportunity to bring justice, equality and fair play into the justice system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an unanswerable case for the early introduction of the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill.  The case in favour of the Bill is open and shut.  I say that as somebody who, like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, practised for many years as a solicitor.  I say so on behalf of more than 95% of the solicitors and barristers who try to give a decent honourable service to their clients.  I also say it on behalf of that 95% or more who are utterly appalled by the way the reputation of the legal profession is being tarnished by some rogue lawyers and in particular by the recent high-profile cases involving enormous amounts of money.  Those 95% plus want to see those practices stamped out.  I do not intend to comment on those high profile cases except to say I want to see due process taking place.  I am not making any presumptions about them getting their just deserts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Looking at the broader issue, it is important for those who want to give a decent honourable service as lawyers as well as for the general public to whom they provide the service.  We have a system where justice is done and seen to be done from the point of view of any complaints arising from giving or perhaps more usually not giving that service.  What is expected of lawyers in this day and age?  I have just finished reading the book, <i>Jasper Wolfe of Skibbereen</i>, about the founder of my firm.  In his time not only did he need to show competence and honesty, but he also needed to show complete bravery and courage.  He was appointed crown solicitor after 1916 and his first job in that role was to represent the crown at the inquest into the murder of the lord mayor of Cork, Tom&aacute;s McCurtain.  He did it because he had to do it &mdash; it was his job.  After the verdict of wilful murder against Lloyd George and Lord French, the lord lieutenant, was brought in, Jasper Wolfe for his pains was sentenced to death by the IRA.  For various reasons he was able to deal with that matter.</P>
        <P>In the past people like him needed to deal with more than the ordinary service to their clients and needed to show great courage and bravery in doing their job.  That courage and bravery was recognised by the people of Cork West who returned him at the head of the poll to this House in the 1920s.  While we do not expect that type of courage and bravery nowadays from our lawyers, we expect competence and honesty.  We need a system in place that holds to account those who are not up to the mark.  Those who try to do the job properly are diminished by the actions of a few &mdash; the bad apples in the barrel.  This is why I so strongly support the Bill.</P>
        <P>Having said that, we should not ignore that there is a system of dealing with complaints currently in place.  It is not as though we are inventing a completely new system.  I note the annual report of the Law Society of Ireland disciplinary tribunal for 2007 has just been published.  It indicates strong action is being taken against a number of solicitors against whom complaints were made.  That tribunal consists of 30 members including 20 members of the legal profession and ten laypeople.  Despite the work of that tribunal, which seems at this stage to be effective, there is a need for a totally independent oversight body that is statutorily underpinned and that will have the kinds of powers mentioned in the Bill.  I want to see the Bill in place because the ombudsman system has proved itself over the years.</P>
        <P>The system originally came from the Nordic countries.  It has served us well, particularly because of the high calibre of the people who have served as Ombudsmen, going back to Mr. <Col N="820"/>Michael Mills, followed by Mr. Kevin Murphy and now, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly.  It has been a very effective system.</P>
        <P>I want to make one point in the context of how the ombudsman system has developed.  We have a plethora of ombudsmen, some of them women&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Most of them are women. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Exactly.  All of them are doing a good job, but while not questioning whether we need them all, is there not some way these offices might be better co-ordinated?  I say this in the context of the examination that should be underway as regards the need for the 1,000 or so State bodies we have.  I am not proposing the abolition of any of the ombudsman offices as they exist.  I understand they are all doing a good job, but nonetheless, there are quite a few.  The original Office of the Ombudsman was set up in 1980 on foot of complaints against Departments and some State bodies.  There is also a Pensions Ombudsman, an Ombudsman for Children, a Financial Services Ombudsman dealing with the credit institutions, and an Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  In more recent times we have set up the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and there is also the Press Ombudsman.  In the context of setting up yet another ombudsman&rsquo;s office, there may be a case for an overall look at the system, to discern whether efficiencies might be achieved, perhaps by some co-ordination of resources.  I think in particular of office facilities and administrative back-up.  Is there some efficient manner we can ensure the various ombudsman offices can work better together for the future?  Obviously, this would have to be carefully teased out, but I see some possibilities there for greater efficiency.</P>
        <P>One can anticipate that any incumbent Ombudsman will argue he or she is doing a good job, and I am not disputing that.  Recently, I saw the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces had very few staff and was operating out of highly unsuitable offices.  Perhaps that Ombudsman might be able to work out of one of the other offices, perhaps under the wing of the main Ombudsman.  It is certainly worth examining.</P>
        <P>Another issue I want to focus on is parliamentary oversight.  The Bill provides for the report of the legal services ombudsman to be laid before the Oireachtas and to be fully considered, presumably by a committee of the House.  Now that we, as Members of the Oireachtas, are looking at the affairs of the legal profession, perhaps it might be apposite for us, also, to look at our situation in the context of the operation of the system here.  Do we genuinely have a system in the Oireachtas whereby proper and full consideration is given to reports of the type mentioned in this Bill?  Is it merely for the record that these reports will be laid before the House or are we going to be able to make a continuing input into the system by having them properly examined and debated?  I question that and believe it is probably time for us in this Parliament to look within ourselves and decide whether reform is necessary here, so Members of the Oireachtas may provide a better system to the general public in dealing not just with reports from people such as the Ombudsman, but otherwise.</P>
        <P>Overall, this Bill is needed.  It is part of a process of reform we have to encourage and was recommended by the Competition Authority.  Experience in other countries, particularly in England and Wales, has shown that the Ombudsman system has a positive effect from the viewpoint of engendering more confidence among the general public in dealing with lawyers and in providing a more acceptable complaints system.  I am delighted to see the Bill, and I want it to be in operation as soon as possible.  As far as the legal services ombudsman is concerned, roll on the Bill and let us have it in operation within the coming months, if we can.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="821"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Deputies from the far side of the House for their contributions.  I shall follow on from what Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe said in his first few words, as a practising solicitor for more than 20 years, before and during my time in this House.  I want to echo Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s words as regards the abhorrence that 95% of the solicitors&rsquo; profession have for some of the revelations that have taken place in recent times.  This is not to say it did not happen over the years.  During my time in full-time practice, I was always aware that among the general public the solicitors&rsquo; profession, which I knew more about, but indeed barristers, too, was self-regulatory.  When a complaint was made it was very difficult to get closure, but we have moved on a long way from then.  The Law Society and the Bar Council, as the representative bodies of their respective professions, because of the general public outcry and the fact that in general society is much more transparent, have made a strong effort to ensure justice is not only seen to be done, but actually done.  Clearly, that is something all Members of this House welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Deputies for their broad welcome for this Bill and the support they have given it.  As regards the comments Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe has made about the plethora of ombudspersons, there is some justification for looking at this.  This is why the Government is reviewing the question of getting some synergies among some of the bodies with similar remits.  In this instance, however, particularly given that the office of the legal services ombudsman will be funded by a levy from the profession, it is difficult, quite apart from its remit, to see how it might be subsumed into some other office.  Nonetheless, I acknowledge and concur with the sentiments expressed by a number of Deputies on the positive contributions made by the various incumbents of Ombudsman offices in this State.  I have used them during my career as a public representative and sometimes encouraged constituents to do so on occasions when I could not obtain definite answers to their queries.  A number of Deputies expressed the view that the ombudsman should not be a practising member of the legal profession.  Section 5 specifically excludes practising barristers and solicitors from appointment as ombudsman, while also providing that the Government satisfies itself that the person appointed has appropriate experience, qualifications, training and expertise.</P>
        <P>The legislation gives the ombudsman a broad set of functions and powers.  Deputies were concerned to ensure the Bill would not be toothless and that it would contain adequate power of investigation and enforcement.  I draw attention to the general functions and powers of the ombudsman provided for in section 9, which include receiving and investigating complaints, reviewing the procedures of the Bar Council and the Law Society for dealing with complaints made to them by clients of barristers and solicitors, assessing the adequacy of the admissions policies of both professional bodies and promoting public awareness of their complaints procedures.</P>
        <P>Part 4 contains the substantive provisions relating to the ombudsman&rsquo;s functions in respect of complaints and reviews.  He or she will have an array of powers in the investigation of complaints, including to conduct investigations under section 22, to require persons to provide information and to attend before the ombudsman under section 26, to issue directions or make recommendations to the Law Society or Bar Council under section 27 and to enforce directions through the High Court under section 30.  In particular, with regard to complaints against solicitors, on completion of an investigation the ombudsman may direct the Law Society to make an application to the solicitors&rsquo; disciplinary tribunal for an inquiry into alleged misconduct.  In the event of a finding of misconduct, the tribunal may refer its findings and recommendations to the President of the High Court.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenneally raised the issue of the power of the Minister to ensure the Law Society or Bar Council do not default on the payment of the levy to cover the cost of the ombudsman&rsquo;s office.  I refer him to section 20(1), which gives the Minister the power to make regulations to <Col N="822"/>ensure payment is made by both bodies.  The subsection provides for rules on the collection and recovery of the levy, including the rate of interest on amounts not paid when due.  An opportunity is provided for the Minister to intervene if both bodies do not make the levy available.</P>
        <P>In addition to his or her powers of investigation of individual complaints, the ombudsman has important general review powers under section 32, which enable him or her to review the procedures of the Bar Council and Law Society for dealing with client complaints.  These include powers to examine the compliance of barristers and solicitors with complaints procedures, such random complaints as the ombudsman considers appropriate, the effectiveness of the two professional bodies&rsquo; procedures, the time taken to complete investigations and complaints relating to particular matters as the ombudsman considers appropriate.  Arising from such a review, the ombudsman may make written recommendations to the Bar Council and Law Society to improve their complaints investigation procedures and the co-operation of barristers and solicitors with them.  If he or she is not satisfied with the response, the ombudsman may direct that the recommendations be implemented and such directions may be enforced through the High Court.</P>
        <P>Section 14 is also an important provision in that it gives the ombudsman the power to submit reports to the Minister on issues that, because of their gravity or other exceptional circumstances, should be the subject of a special report.  If these functions and powers prove inadequate, section 14 provides that, within two years of the date of appointment, the ombudsman may submit to the Minister a report on the effectiveness of the office and the adequacy of the functions of the office.  The legislation, therefore, affords an early opportunity for change if the ombudsman feels he or she does not have the requisite powers.</P>
        <P>I have noted Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s suggestion that the ombudsman should produce a customer charter.  Section 23 provides that he or she may establish and publish procedures on the receipt and investigation of complaints and, in that context, he or she could issue a customer&rsquo;s charter.</P>
        <P>Deputies Flanagan and &Oacute; Snodaigh queried the need under section 25 for the ombudsman&rsquo;s investigations to be conducted in private.  Because many of these matters are sensitive and owing to the personal or private nature of legal services provided by lawyers to clients I consider, having examined the issue, that it is appropriate that investigations carried out by the ombudsman be conducted in private.</P>
        <P>A number of Deputies commented on the levy provisions.  The 2006 legislation provided for the costs of the office of the ombudsman to be met entirely by the Law Society and the Bar Council.  The levy provisions in the 2006 Bill apportioned the cost of the office of the ombudsman between the Law Society and the Bar Council by reference to the respective numbers of practising solicitors and barristers.  This would have imposed a disproportionately high charge on the Bar Council in view of the low numbers of complaints made against barristers.  In drafting this legislation, the levy provisions were reviewed to take account of this disproportionate charge with a view to putting in place a fairer charging arrangement.</P>
        <P>Section 19 of the legislation provides that the costs of the office of the ombudsman be recouped by way of an annual charge on the Law Society and Bar Council.  The annual charge will be calculated by reference to the respective numbers of complaints made to the ombudsman relating to solicitors and barristers subject to a minimum charge on each body of at least 10% of the total annual cost.  The minimum charge takes account of the costs of carrying out functions additional to investigating individual complaints, including reviewing the complaints mechanisms and the admissions policies of the two bodies.  As a result of these changes, the <Col N="823"/>annual charge will be apportioned between the two professional bodies in a manner that reflects the workload of the ombudsman.  This brings more proportionality to the levy provisions.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised recent cases, which are before the courts, concerning misuse of property title deeds.  Generally solicitors were given the opportunity over the years to provide letters of undertaking, as Deputy Flanagan will be aware from his practice.  Such letters are no more than a promise by a solicitor to provide the necessary documentation and anybody who abuses this facility should be brought to justice and censured for breaking the trust they are given in this respect.  We are putting significant reform in place, which will ensure solicitors, in particular, are punished if they break that trust in closing transactions on the basis of letters of undertaking.</P>
        <P>Not surprisingly, several Deputies raised the issue of legal costs.  A legal costs Bill is included in the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, which was published on 23 September 2008.  Work is under way in my Department on preparing the scheme of the Bill, which will provide for reform of the manner in which disputed legal costs are assessed.  It will also provide for significant improvements in the quality and quantity of the information that a solicitor is required to provide to clients and the manner in which it is supplied.  A further objective is to ensure the litigant has a central role to play in controlling his or her legal costs.  This will be a new system for assessment of legal costs, which provides information to the public on the law and on a client&rsquo;s entitlements relating to his or her costs.</P>
        <P>Deputies Rabbitte and Flanagan raised the issue of the so-called &ldquo;solicitor&rsquo;s lien&rdquo;, an established right under common law, whereby a solicitor may retain a client&rsquo;s file pending payment from the client.  The Competition Authority viewed this as an unnecessary restriction on switching of solicitors by clients and recommended legislating to extinguish this common law right.  The policy underpinning the existence of the lien has been approved by the courts here and in England and Wales.  As the law stands, two remedies are open to an aggrieved client.  He or she may either apply to court to have the lien set aside or complain to the Law Society, which may set aside the lien pursuant to section 8 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994.  In addition, the society has in place a practice notice since 1996 dealing with the law and recommended practice in this area.  I understand that such disputes are invariably resolved without recourse to the courts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the event of the lien being extinguished, it is inevitable that some clients would be required to make full or partial payment for legal services in advance in circumstances in which it does not occur at present.  While it is legitimate that solicitors will not allow a file out of their possession until they have their costs paid, they take on business without advance payment.  As Deputy Charlie Flanagan would concur, were we to extinguish the lien, solicitors would demand payment up front before proceeding.  This would cause unnecessary difficulty for clients who may not be able to afford advance payment.  We have considered the matter and the best way to deal with it would be to leave the situation as is, particularly given the censure provided for in section 8 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act.  The Law Society may set aside a lien in circumstances of dispute.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh raised the issue of the difficulty in engaging a solicitor to act against another solicitor.  While this was the case when I started out, particularly in a small geographic area, and because of the perceived difficulty, the Law Society set up a panel of solicitors who would be available in such circumstances.  I am aware of cases taken against solicitors by panel solicitors, an arrangement that has worked well.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy of reform of the legal professions is reflected in the enactment this year of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which provides for a number of reforms of regulatory matters in respect of solicitors, including providing for a majority of lay member<Col N="824"/>ship on the Law Society&rsquo;s regulatory committees, the publication this year of the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill and the commitment to publish a legal costs Bill.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that policy is to ensure the highest standards and best practice are maintained by both legal professions.  I commend the D&aacute;il and Members on both sides of the House for their good contributions.  I hope the Bill passes as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to debate this important legislation.  We must reflect on the value of elections and democracy.  It is also important to reflect on the broad debate of recent weeks on public servants and their integrity and quality of work.</P>
        <P>While many people complain about politics and democracy, the system works.  If people do not like their politicians, they can vote them out.  At times, it is a tough and competitive business and it needs to change, but we should reflect on its importance in our parliamentary democracy.  It should never be a question of money, a situation in other countries that concerns me.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is &ldquo;to revise D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies, to provide for the number of members to be elected for such constituencies, to amend the law relating to the Constituency Commission and to provide alternative procedures for nomination of non-party candidates at European Parliament and local elections&rdquo;.  Section 3 provides that the number of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann after the next dissolution will remain at the current figure of 166, as recommended by the commission.  I disagree with section 3, as we should not box ourselves into the low figure of 166.  There is no reason not to expand to 168 Deputies, particularly given the increase in the population and the pressures placed on Ministers and Deputies, particularly backbenchers.  Many Deputies are afraid to say that section 3 should be amended to allow for 168 Members.</P>
        <P>Section 8 &ldquo;provides for the European Parliament constituencies, and the number of members to be elected from Ireland, by substituting a new Third Schedule to the European Parliament Elections Act 1997&rdquo;.  It provides, in a context of 12 representatives from Ireland in the European Parliament, for a reduction of a seat in the Dublin constituency and the transfer of the population of counties Longford and Westmeath from the east constituency to the north-west constituency.</P>
        <P>Section 8 is provocative and we should focus the debate on Ireland&rsquo;s 12 representatives.  I am not happy with that number or with the reduction of one seat in the Dublin area.  This city is expanding and its population is increasing, but we are to lose a seat.  All Deputies should try <Col N="825"/>to defend our current numbers.  If we are serious about democracy, we should consider making changes to section 8.</P>
        <P>Section 10 amends the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 by substituting new sections 12, 13 and 13A for the existing sections.  These sections cover the nomination of non-party candidates at European Parliament elections, bringing the procedures into line with those enacted for D&aacute;il elections in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2007.  The new sections provide for two alternative mechanisms to regulate the nomination of European Parliament candidates who are not in possession of a certificate of political affiliation confirming that he or she is a candidate of a political party registered in the Register of Political Parties.  These alternatives, one of which must be complied with before the expiration of the time for receiving nominations, include assents requiring the completion of statutory declarations by 60 assentors registered as European electors in the relevant European constituency, which may be witnessed by one of five categories &mdash; a Commissioner for Oaths, a peace commissioner, a notary public, a garda or a local authority official &mdash; and the candidate or someone on his or her behalf lodging a deposit of &euro;1,800 with the returning officer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People who wish to put themselves forward for public office must be conscious of these issues, particularly in terms of finances.  It is important not to place barriers in front of those who genuinely wish to attain public office.  This was evident during the recent debate on the Lisbon treaty, when issues of democracy that concern us all arose.  As Deputies know, I voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but I have always stood for a democratic and peaceful Europe.  We should reflect on the concerns people had about the treaty.  If those on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side are serious about democracy, they must respect the result.  One is either a democrat or one is not.</P>
        <P>What people saw in the Lisbon treaty was an obligation on member states to increase their military capacity.  Article 28.3 states: &ldquo;Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities&rdquo;.  This matter arose during the debate on Europe, which is relevant to this legislation.  Many people asked me why we did not include a section in the Lisbon treaty stating we would improve our health and disability capabilities.  This is a legitimate concern.  Many women raised this with me in public debates in Artane, Marino, Donnycarney and Coolock.</P>
        <P>Dealing with the population size could also be a power grab by major states for control of the new Union.  By basing EU law-making primarily on population size, the Lisbon treaty would double Germany&rsquo;s say on the EU Council of Ministers from 8% to 17%, France from 8% to 13% and Britain and Italy from 8% to 12%.  On the basis of population, Ireland&rsquo;s voting weight would be more than halved to 1%.  Article 17(5) referred to the idea of removing any Irish voice from the Commission, the body with a monopoly on proposing EU laws, for five years out of 15 years but this was dismissed at the time.</P>
        <P>These issues are relevant to European constituencies and the debate on Europe.  Let us have a sensible, practical, unemotional debate on Europe.  Let us stop labelling people or taking them out personally.  People want to know the facts.  The reality is that 53.4% voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; and 46.6% voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  In my constituency, 49.5% voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; and 50.6% voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, a majority of 376 with a turnout of 61%.  I had to accept that most people in my constituency voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and I respect that verdict.  All I ask is to respect the broader verdict of those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the national stage.</P>
        <P>The treaty required all EU member states to ratify it.  It cannot be implemented, no matter what the other 26 states do.  Let us consider the reality that one can vote to change the rules of a club but it does not mean one is out of the club.  We must challenge this.  One option is a clear and legally binding statement on the treaty concerning tax, foreign policy and neutrality.  A hard look at reforms when dealing with new commissioners is needed.</P><Col N="826"/>
        <P>The EU could make a positive statement about the role of its citizens in Europe.  Mr. Beno&icirc;t Keane, the EU lawyer and chair of the Brussels branch of the Institute of International and European Affairs stated this.  Voters have raised legitimate concerns and we must deal with these.  I call on the Government to listen carefully, particularly those on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side.  I raise this because it is relevant and applies to the European section.</P>
        <P>Section 14 of the legislation amends the schedule to the Electoral Act 1997 &ldquo;to provide that necessary travelling and other expenses incurred by a candidate or an assentor in meeting the assentor requirements, and the amount of any deposit paid, shall not be regarded as an election expense for the election concerned&rdquo;.  I welcome this, which is sensible.  Section 15 amends the Local Elections Regulations 1995 by inserting articles 11 to 20 in substitution for the existing ones.  The term &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; is negative and people should be allowed to put the term <?oasys _ch ?>&ldquo;independent&rdquo; on the ballot paper if they wish.  This is a democratic wish.</P>
        <P>One can see the influence of independents in the US election, where both candidates are examining the swing voters and the independent vote.  We should recognise this in Ireland rather than using the term &ldquo;non-party&rdquo;.  When going for election I leave that section blank rather than use the negative term &ldquo;non-party&rdquo;.  I also reject the term &ldquo;non-national&rdquo; because everyone has a nationality from somewhere and I urge Members to use the term &ldquo;foreign nationals&rdquo; when referring to people from other countries.  It is not a question of being politically correct but of being respectful towards those of different countries, with different languages, religions and faiths.  Let us enjoy difference rather than finding ways to divide ourselves.</P>
        <P>I refer to section 15:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(i) by way of assents requiring the completion of statutory declarations by 15 assentors registered as electors in the relevant local electoral area which may be witnessed by one of 5 categories: a Commissioner for Oaths, a Peace Commissioner, a Notary Public, a Garda or a local authority official; or</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(ii) by way of the candidate, or someone on his or her behalf, lodging a deposit of &euro;100 (in the case of the election of members of a county or city council) or &euro;50 (in the case of any other election).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">We should seriously examine this.  The sums of money are small and one needs this small sum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dublin North-Central is a three seat constituency and has 75,206 registered voters, meaning there are 25,092 registered voters per Deputy.  Many years ago, the figure was in the region of 20,000 and may have increased by 5,000 extra per Deputy.  People often dismiss this and tell me to get on with life and to stop whinging but the reality is that if there are 75,206 registered voters and 10% of this figure contacts a constituency office in a year, that amounts to 7,500 voters.  I remind those outside politics, the smart alec, cynical brigade, that this is a reality for many legislators in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann when dealing with proposed constituencies, the number of seats, the population per Deputy and the variance from national representations.  The Dublin North-Central constituency is reduced by 1.76% but we still have 25,000 voters per Deputy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The overall aim of the Bill is to modernise and update electoral law, which is sensible.  The objective of the Bill is to revise D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies and provide for the number of members to be elected for such constituencies in accordance with the report of the Constituency Commission 2007, as stated in Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill.  The Bill amends the law relating to the constituency revision process, having regard to the High Court judgment arising from the Murphy <i>v.</i> McGrath cases.  This is an issue that the former Deputy for Kildare North, Catherine Murphy, raised.  We brought it to the High Court and I was honoured to be <Col N="827"/>part of the challenge to ensure we have democracy, fair play and respect for citizens in this country.  I wish my former colleague, Catherine Murphy, well.  I believe she is running in the local elections.</P>
        <P>The legislation provides an alternative statutory mechanism to regulate the nomination of non-party candidates at European Parliament and local elections, in line with those elected in D&aacute;il elections under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2007.  What concerns me is that the term &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; is used.  This is negative and we should not be afraid to use the word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;.  Sections 3 and 4 of Parts V and VI refer to the nomination of non-party candidates at the European and local elections.  It is important to revisit this section.</P>
        <P>Referring to the summary of the 2007 Constituency Commission recommendations, the commission pointed out the arguments for and against the total number of seats: &ldquo;However, after detailed consideration, we decided not to recommend any change because we were satisfied that the present level of membership allowed for a reasonable arrangement of constituencies in accordance with the relevant constitutional provisions and our terms of reference&rdquo;.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The commission notes the population at the 2006 census of 4,239,848.  On this basis total D&aacute;il membership could be fixed at any number between 141 and 211.  I never saw that figure before I was pushing for 168 Deputies in the D&aacute;il.  However, the statutory terms of reference limited the commission to the range of 164-168 seats.  The number of Members has increased over time but has stood at 166 since 1980, a level determined on the basis of the 1979 population of 3 million.  In respect of the 2006 population, the increase is 871,000 or 25.9% more than in 1979, making the national average population per Deputy 25,541 compared to 20,000 in 1979.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I wish to share time with Deputies Joan Burton and Arthur Morgan.</P>
        <P>My Labour Party colleagues and I note with concern the considerable growth in unemployment.  Our motion sets out the current situation, encompassing the hardship that confronts so many of our constituents, their families and individuals across the country.  We advocate a number of new and novel solutions and ask the Government to take note of them because we put them forward in a constructive way.  I emphasise that.  They should be pursued vigorously to address the problems outlined in the motion.</P>
        <P>Judging from its amendment, this Government has learned nothing.  It offers no new initiative but purveys old solutions dressed up and labelled in new bottles.  That is no way to address our current economic problems which present us with unemployment figures of over 240,000.  Colleagues will note that this number would fill Croke Park three times over on All-Ireland day, at full capacity.  That is the dimension of the problem that confronts us.</P>
        <P>The apathy and complacency of the Government have undermined and embellished every proposal we have brought to the House.  This reinforces the public sense that there is a deeply embedded apathy and possibly an inability at the core of Government concerning how to confront these issues.  Government has had it so good for so long that its members do not know they are complacent and apathetic.  It is time that this Government addressed the problem in a strong and vigorous way, bringing forward new and innovative ideas.  Today my party leader asked the Taoiseach about this issue and received the usual bland reply.  The Taoiseach says he is bringing forward a budget six weeks early but that is no way to address a problem.  It is merely window dressing.</P><Col N="829"/>
        <P>As we discuss this motion, the world economy is entering the greatest crisis it has faced since the Great Depression.  For several years perceptive economists who are independent of business, as is my accountant colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, have predicted the current crisis and have suggested ways of mitigating its effects.  They have been ignored by Governments, including our own, who prefer to listen to economists employed as cheerleaders by banks.  Those ones tried to persuade us the boom would last forever.</P>
        <P>Like other small open economies Ireland is particularly vulnerable to the vagaries of the world economy.  However, some decisions taken by the present Government and its predecessors, now entering a 12th year in power, have increased rather than reduced our vulnerability.  It was clear the export-led boom generated by inward investment was coming to an end by 2002 and that from then on we were becoming more and more dependent on construction.  There is an old saying that people do not grow rich by taking in one another&rsquo;s washing.  It is also true that building and selling houses to one another is not a sustainable basis for economic growth.  That is as true as the nose on one&rsquo;s face.</P>
        <P>It was also clear by the late 1990s that the construction industry no longer needed the plethora of incentives put in place to encourage activity in the 1980s.  Instead of getting rid of these schemes, however, more were added.  As Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach finally got around to scrapping these schemes last year, just as construction was beginning to decline.  We now have a glut of often poorly constructed houses and apartments in areas not served with public transport and without services, sometimes even without footpaths.  At the same time there are 40,000 people on local authority waiting lists.  We saw the cancellation of vital urban renewal schemes such as St. Michael&rsquo;s Mansions and O&rsquo;Devanney Gardens.  Private developers withdrew from the public private partnerships which the Government believed to be the solution to all public expenditure problems.  My colleagues, Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Joan Burton, have been to the forefront in exposing this myth.</P>
        <P>As one of the most open economies in the world, Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity depends on producing and selling goods and services for export at competitive prices.  While we have continued to attract inward investment over the past five years in high-tech industries we have lost thousands of jobs in lower skilled manufacturing and many of the workers who lost those jobs are being consigned to long-term unemployment.  Our major concern is that this country will revert to having institutionalised or structural unemployment, thereby aping what happened here in the 1980s.  In the first eight months of this year over 23,500 people were made redundant, a 36% increase on the same period in 2007.  Many of their jobs were in manufacturing, some of it relatively high-tech.</P>
        <P>The Government has tried to gloss over the level of redundancies and boasts of its job creation record but we must examine the kinds of jobs that have been created.  We have doubled our workforce over the past 20 years but the Government does not care to admit how many of the jobs created are in low-skilled work.  Approximately one tenth of the labour force, 200,000 workers, now earn less than &euro;10 per hour.  With bankers and their incomes in the news at the moment we might reflect on the fact that some top bank executives receive &euro;1,500 per hour while 1 million people earn less than &euro;15.50 per hour.  That is the dimension of the situation and it is what ordinary people in the streets are asking about now.  The majority of those who take up these low-paid jobs have lower secondary education, or less.  Deputy Burton has been a strong advocate in this area.  It is a shocking failure of our educational training system that at the height of the boom we had to rely on immigrant skilled labour to fill so many jobs when so many of our young people were leaving the school system without educational qualifications or skills.</P><Col N="830"/>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has warned that up to 65,400 construction workers may lose their jobs by the end of 2009.  I would like to hear some proposals from F&Aacute;S on how it will provide these redundant workers with new skills.  I am disappointed that F&Aacute;S has not been very effective in retraining workers who are made redundant.  In some cases, indeed, a F&Aacute;S training course does not seem to greatly enhance employment prospects.  In addition to auditing the financial controls of that organisation the Government should examine some recent decisions of F&Aacute;S which were probably prompted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  There was, for example, a crazy decision to reduce the pension budget by &euro;10 million this year and by an additional &euro;27 million next year.  We must look at these decisions of Government.</P>
        <P>There is a jobs club in Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary which works as a committee.  However, F&Aacute;S states that jobs clubs are failing to provide participants for courses when in fact it is the responsibility of F&Aacute;S to do this.  This is in that organisation&rsquo;s contract, referred to in the agreement.  The jobs club in Carrick-on-Suir was proposed for closure in January 2008.  How can the Government agree to the closure of a jobs club in an area where local unemployment increased by 30%, from 972 in January 2008 to 1,319 in August 2008?  That is an increase of 44% signing on between August 2007 and August 2008.  The downward trend in the national economic cycle is hitting Carrick-on-Suir disproportionately, as seen in current figures from the Central Statistics Office.  A jobs club is now more essential than ever in order to contain rising unemployment.  It gives hope and inspiration to many who have nobody else to turn to and enjoys a high profile in the area.  All major building activity in that area has ceased and many young people in the 18-30 age group have had to emigrate to avoid a bleak future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State to intervene with F&Aacute;S and ensure this jobs club is not closed.  That would be another retrograde step.  At the very time when such clubs are needed, F&Aacute;S declares they should be closed.  I have opposed that.  The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment met representatives from the club and they received all-party support.  They had a meeting with the Minister of State at the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kelleher, and as a result the evil day has been postponed.  We will pursue this matter and we want more radical innovative solutions from F&Aacute;S.  We do not want lame old solutions such as the closure of places that are of immense importance at this point in the economic cycle.</P>
        <P>We must adopt a more proactive training programme for redundant workers and for new entrants to the labour force.  The cap on the VTOS scheme must be lifted at once and institutes of technology must be given further resources to enable them increase the number of places they provide.  Because of declining numbers of school leavers some of the ITs will have spare capacity which could be used for training and retraining workers.</P>
        <P>The time which must elapse before an unemployed person is entitled to the back to education allowance should be shortened or eliminated.  The Minister states this allowance is awarded if a worker gets statutory redundancy but what about those who do not receive statutory redundancy, who are simply laid off?  We should encourage people to return to education and not have any limitation on the scheme.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, is not here because she knows well that she was the person who introduced these restrictions on eligibility and the conditions for participation.</P>
        <P>She had a part in the savage 16 cuts, of which this was one.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>We now are reaping the whirlwind.  The Minister is not present to face the music but has sent in the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade <Col N="831"/>and Employment, Deputy Devins, who was not party to that decision.  It would surprise me were he party to it.</P>
        <P>In Sweden, a worker made redundant is immediately entitled to a training place or further education.  Ireland still has a Victorian attitude to the unemployed, whereby they must be made suffer a period of deprivation before being entitled to enhance their employment prospects.  It is time to move into the 21st century.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Government acted with great alacrity to prop up the banks.  It stayed up several nights to do so and Members also were so obliged.  My Labour Party colleagues and I do not see a similar sense of urgency in dealing with the rapidly rising level of unemployment.  Unless effective action is taken quickly, we may soon have unemployment levels similar to those of the 1980s.  In rural areas of my constituency, as well as those of Deputies Sherlock and Kathleen Lynch, most non-agricultural employment is in the construction industry, in which large numbers of jobs are being lost weekly.</P>
        <P>One must accept that at least in the short run, construction employment must be sustained.  This is the reason the Labour Party has come forward with positive proposals.  It is not carping or giving out and the party leader and deputy leader, who is spokesperson for finance, have costed the proposals.  One third of the expenditure involved would be recouped through taxation.  Moreover, the human benefit that would accrue as a result of Labour&rsquo;s proposals, the uplift that would be provided for the construction industry and the resultant availability of competitive tendering certainly would lead to significant savings for the Exchequer in the long run.  On any cost benefit analysis, the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposals are positive.  I do not wish to hear any more suggestions from the right wing media that the Labour Party merely carps and is negative.  It has brought forward its proposals without the benefit of the mandarins in the Department of Finance or anywhere else.  We worked hard on it with our limited resources,  tabled it on the floor of this Chamber and published it for the people to consider.  That has been acknowledged by some of those journalists and others involved.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party proposes that the Government should embark immediately on a school building programme, which is needed in every constituency, every county and every bloody town we go to.  The Loreto Convent in Mullingar needs refurbishment work to begin and a new 1,000-pupil community college in Athlone is required, to be rid of a completely inadequate old school that was built in the 1970s.  While I can give several further examples, such as Loch an Ghair national school, Sonna national school and Ballynacarrigy national school, I wish to retain a national focus in this regard.  The Labour Party wishes to provide proper accommodation for the 40,000 children who are in prefab classrooms at present.  Every September witnesses the pitiful spectacle of children, for whom no classroom is available, being accommodated in prefabs, halls or GAA clubs.  For real progress to be achieved in school building, it must be taken out of the hands of the Department of Education and Science, which seems incapable of projecting how many children need schools, much less building the schools quickly and efficiently.</P>
        <P>The Government also must ensure that sites for schools are acquired quickly and in good time.  A shocking situation obtains whereby builders of new housing developments are allowed to charge the Department the housing value of the land, thus greatly increasing the cost of building schools.  It should be a requirement of all planning permissions for large housing developments that sites be provided at the original value of the land, not only for schools but for other social amenities.  Many schools built in the 1970s and 1980s are poorly insulated and have high heating costs, much of the money for which must be raised by parents and volunteers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I hear the Government or its friends in the Construction Industry Federation &mdash; dear friends they are &mdash; boasting about how many housing units have been constructed, the phrase, <Col N="832"/>&ldquo;never mind the quality, feel the width&rdquo; comes to mind.  Despite the belated introduction of building regulations, much of the housing built over the past decade is of poor quality and is not up to standard.  I read in a newspaper recently of a builder who shamelessly boasted of his wealth and who revealed that on one development, he made 50% profit.  In no other developed country do builders make such profits because they are required to build to much higher standards, particularly in respect of insulation.  A national insulation scheme, which has been proposed by the Labour Party spokesperson and leader on behalf of the party, would go some way towards reducing energy bills for individual households, as well as reducing Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions and frightening dependence on imported oil.  The building industry should have been paying for such measures at the time.  However, were one to indicate that a levy was required, Members should imagine the squealing from Mr. Parlon and others.  Telephone calls would be made in the middle of the night to stress how difficult is the present position. The boom of the last decade has allowed the Government to ignore structural problems in the labour market that now have re-emerged.  We have become almost wholly dependent on foreign-owned industry to generate exports and for the building industry to provide local jobs in rural areas.  Many more sustainable jobs in local communities must be generated and while county enterprise boards have been effective in such job creation, they are hampered by limitations on the types of enterprises they may assist and on the number of jobs such enterprises may create.  The boards&rsquo; measure 1 budgets in respect of capital and employment and feasibility studies are inadequate.  The demand for budgets from new and expanding business far exceeds available funds.  Were further funding available, undoubtedly it would result in a greater number of business development opportunities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the development of the small business sector.  Enterprise boards operate what are known as measure 2 budgets to directly and indirectly support all sectors of small business, including retail, services, manufacturing, construction, health care and transport.  The primary focus of this budget is to increase business skills and acumen through training, mentoring and marketing programmes.  Investment in such skills leads to better management of business, which in turn leads to growth in job creation across all sectors.  Demand for mentoring and information technology support programmes is very high and has a positive and immediate effect on business growth.  However, budget constraints mean that county enterprise boards cannot meet the demand and such supports are not available on a year-round basis, thus hindering the growth of the small business sector when it is most needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has imposed quotas in this regard.  County enterprise boards are restricted in the allocation of their measure 1 budget.  A maximum of 25% and 10% of such a budget can go towards employment grants and feasibility study grants, respectively.  Moreover, 30% of grants awarded must be repaid.  These quotas are not conducive to small business developments and county enterprise boards should be allowed to facilitate customers&rsquo; needs and should not be restricted by being obliged to meet quotas.</P>
        <P>I refer to the issue of refundable aid.  All recipients of grant aid must repay to the enterprise board 30% of the grants received.  This reduces the attractiveness of the grant received and increases the level of administration for the client.  The level of bureaucracy and regulation is strangling enterprise and must be removed.  The issue of having a nanny state and widespread paternalism must be tackled and a root and branch review must be undertaken in this regard.</P>
        <P>County and city enterprise boards cannot provide direct financial assistance to any business employing more than ten employees.  I have toured the country with Deputy English and some of the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues, such as Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe, and this has created a critical gap in the level of service provision for businesses with ten or more employees serving the domestic market as no agency has official responsibility for their development.  Enterprise <Col N="833"/>Ireland deals with exporters, while IDA Ireland, under Barry O&rsquo;Leary, is doing an excellent job, with 18 or 19 projects in the pipeline.  IDA Ireland has worked hard to do this and I salute it.  I also salute Frank Ryan of Enterprise Ireland, which has done a great job.  The county enterprise boards also have done a good job.  However there is a chasm between the agencies and I ask that this be reviewed.  It is important because there are no opportunities for businesses falling within this category to receive financial support towards their expansion and development.</P>
        <P>The small business forum has recommended that the enterprise boards should be the first stop shop for all small business needs and should take primary responsibility for information dissemination.  This has not yet been implemented.  A single source to obtain business legislation, start-up information, training, advice, mentoring and finance would be highly useful to all new business owners and would use the expertise contained in enterprise boards to maximum effect.  In changing economic times, enterprise boards should be in a position to offer higher levels of grant aid to businesses that offer high potential in new growth areas, such as the alternative energy, information technology, health management and scientific development sectors.  At present, county enterprise boards can offer no additional incentives to those who display enthusiasm or initiative in such areas.</P>
        <P>These limitations should be removed and the county enterprise boards must be given more resources and enabled to co-operate with F&Aacute;S and the institutes of technology more effectively.  Ireland still has many opportunities to develop sustainable and environmentally friendly rural enterprises that are not available to other developed countries.  The county enterprise boards are well placed to exploit these opportunities.</P>
        <P>Therefore the Labour Party has brought before the House another imaginative initiative in this regard.  It proposes loosening the rope, removing levels of bureaucracy, streamlining administration and permitting county enterprise boards to fill the gap that exists between Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  This is particularly crucial in the newer areas to ensure that opportunities are provided in this regard.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has much surplus land nationwide in sites of five and seven acres and many people want small incubator units.  It is wonderful to be able to roll out the red carpet when 200 to 250 jobs are brought in.  Everyone is delighted with that and I salute the Minister of State&rsquo;s efforts in this regard.  I heard him speak at the Small Firms Association and I carefully considered his speech. The Minister of State knows, on reflection, that small is beautiful.  We must start thinking small and realise that three, five, seven and ten-unit jobs are critical to the country.  This is particularly true in rural areas, where the sustainability of the rural fabric of the community is of vital importance.</P>
        <P>We in the Labour Party will give a voice to that community because it is critical to sustain the rural fabric by ensuring people get an opportunity to work in their own environment.  The idea is environmentally friendly and carbon neutral, so it will serve in the reduction of carbon footprints.  There are so many positives that we see it as a no-brainer.  We call on the Government to withdraw its amendment and support the Labour Party motion.  It is positive in terms of ensuring that people get an opportunity to return to gainful employment as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy William Penrose, on putting forward this motion.  It is obvious from the events of the last week, month and year that the tectonic plates of the Irish economy are moving.  Today&rsquo;s quarterly economic commentary from the ESRI forecasts a deeper downturn, which really indicates that a job strategy for the short and medium term is needed urgently from the Government.  The ESRI expects that next year the rate of unemployment will grow to 8%.  As has been said before, we have been losing jobs at the rate of 300 a week since the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, took office.</P><Col N="834"/>
        <P>The Celtic tiger period is over and we are entering a new phase where the scourge of unemployment is once more stalking the land, showing no respect to the city, town, village or, as Deputy Penrose has said, the rural countryside.  We have seen large numbers of young men become unemployed.  Some may well emigrate or go for a year or two to the United States, New Zealand or Australia.  In other cases, immigrants who came here to work in the construction industry may well return home.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, we are facing into a position we have not seen since the late 1980s and early 1990s, where sustained unemployment is becoming the norm for significant groups of people.  It would be a tragedy if the Government, which has worked so hard to rescue distressed bankers, did not feel some concern about the distress of families and individuals who are facing unemployment.</P>
        <P>Whether this is a long recession or a relatively short period through which we can transit to a more mature and solid &mdash; if modest &mdash; rate of economic growth and prosperity depends on how the Government deals with the current position.  Handled badly, particularly in next week&rsquo;s budget, and if too much activity is sucked from the economy, the Government will turn a recession into a depression.  The modest and careful proposals by the Labour Party aim to put people back to work through retraining and reskilling, and they are critical for tens of thousands of families in every village and town across the country.</P>
        <P>The Government has rightly sought to address the banking crisis, but dealing with that crisis must not become the Government&rsquo;s excuse for avoiding the unemployment crisis.  The Government has threatened a dire budget next week and all indications are that the brunt of a difficult budget will be borne by middle class families and working people.  It is their husbands, wives, children, sisters and brothers who are becoming redundant or unemployed.</P>
        <P>Labour&rsquo;s proposals are important in directing people back to employment.  They are achievable within the reduced resources now available.  It is really important that the Government takes this in &mdash; if it takes too much advice from the bankers it will concentrate on the high finance sector of the economy rather than jobs in all the different manifestations, as highlighted by Deputy Penrose.  In particular, there are high-tech jobs in pharmaceuticals and IT, but there are also the small, medium and large indigenous local enterprises on which we must focus again.</P>
        <P>We must be particularly aware of the number of young men leaving the construction industry, with many from rural areas now going back to farming even though they are unlikely to earn a proper income.  A strategy by the Government for dealing with that is absolutely essential.</P>
        <P>We heard last night of the threat of 1,500 redundancies in Aer Lingus, with many of them in Dublin, the mid-west and possibly some in Cork.  This is devastating.  When Aer Lingus and other large companies restructured before, people were given notice.  Dublin West is in many ways the home of restructuring.  Other jobs and avenues were available before, but in a recession there will not be other jobs.  That will make life, as we approach Christmas, so hard for so many families.</P>
        <P>I will mention some particular issues.  One thing we asked of the Government in the debate on banking last week was to consider the issue of distress.  In the context of the banking crisis, the lack of liquidity has a direct and congruent impact on the capacity of firms to continue to get overdrafts or actually pay and employ people.  On its own, the banking crisis is clearly of enormous significance but its significance to the real economy, consisting of firms employing people and others who are self-employed, is perhaps even more important.  This is what caused the significant level of difficulty in the United States.  If the Government does not connect the cause of the banking crisis and its impact that could lead to massive unemployment in this country, its analysis and capacity to create a strategy to get us out of this will be limited.</P><Col N="835"/>
        <P>On Committee Stage in last week&rsquo;s debate, we tabled amendment No. 19<i>a</i>, which indicated the six banks in the system &mdash; as well as the eight others now mentioned as queuing for the guarantee scheme &mdash; should produce a scheme for people in distress as a result of unemployment and who are in danger of losing their houses through an incapacity to pay a mortgage for a certain time.  The courts opened yesterday and Start Mortgages, ACC and various other banks lined up to take people in, charging them not just the arrears of mortgages, but horrendous penalties and legals fees.  This is exploitation of distress at an extreme level.  The Minister of State should know that in Islamic countries, banks are not allowed, under Islamic law known as <i>riba</i>, to inflict distress on innocent people who are the victims of an economic downturn without seeking to give them a mechanism by which they can salvage their position over a period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will mention another issue regarding this week&rsquo;s budget.  Many people becoming unemployed were self-employed in the construction sector and were working on certs.  These people and possibly their partners have been working.  If these people lose their jobs and the partner is working either full-time or part-time, they will go down to being a single income family.  In this case, they will lose their income and have to wait a long period to qualify for a social welfare payment or mortgage interest relief support from the community welfare officer.  They will also suffer a penalty of between approximately &euro;2,000 and &euro;6,000 because in tax terms they will move from being a double income family with double income allowances to being a single income family and subject to the hammer of individualisation introduced by Charlie McCreevy to force both parents out to work.</P>
        <P>Given these changing circumstances and the loss of the breadwinner&rsquo;s job in families where the man works in the construction sector and the woman probably works in paid employment, I ask the Minister to have regard to what individualisation will do to such families.  The impact may not be felt this year because these families will, I hope, have some taxable income for both spouses but it will be felt next year when they will receive limited social welfare payments because they have been self-employed and a whammy of a tax penalty by means of extra taxes of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;6,000.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Labour Party for sharing time with me this evening and on many other occasions recently, and commend Deputy Penrose and his colleagues for tabling this important motion.  </P>
        <P>Much of the discussion in the lead-up to budget 2009 has centred short-sightedly on the need for cuts to public spending and a stimulus package for the plummeting property market.  The crucial area of job creation and enterprise has been overlooked as the main means of rebuilding our struggling economy.  With unemployment at its highest levels in a decade and certain to increase next year, the Government&rsquo;s options for raising revenue will continue to be seriously curtailed unless a strategy can be put in place to put more people in employment, thereby increasing direct revenue returns and lessening the drain on public resources through social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>While every sector is being hit by job losses &mdash; as the motion correctly points out, announcements of redundancies in the manufacturing sector have become depressingly frequent &mdash; the construction sector has been worst affected.  It is important to analyse how this sector managed to attract such large numbers of young people, particularly men, and was allowed to develop to the extent it did.  In the ten-year period up to 2007, employee numbers in the industry soared from fewer than 100,000 to 260,000.  At its peak, construction accounted for almost one quarter of all economic activity and much of the increase was driven by tax reliefs and property incentives offered by the Government.</P><Col N="836"/>
        <P Just="Left">The gross mutability of the construction sector allowed the Government, the heads of industry and the banks to profit from people getting themselves into debt to own a home.  The aforementioned looked on as thousands of young people left their schooling prematurely to join what was at best a precarious industry to avail of opportunities which everyone involved knew could not last.  In a reply to a recent parliamentary question, I was informed that approximately 50% of those who lost their jobs in construction in the past two years were aged under 25 years and a large percentage of them did not have a leaving certificate.</P>
        <P>Another problem faced by those suffering the downturn in construction appears to be the large numbers who were forced into becoming C2 certificate holders, that is, self-employed, by employers who wished to avoid making basic payments on their behalf.  In highlighting this phenomenon at the time, I stated it would cause problems later and, unfortunately, it appears that I was correct.  I have been contacted by a number of constituents who have realised they do not have the basic PRSI levels required to avail of social welfare payments now that they are out of work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is essential that we help those who are becoming unemployed in the construction sector.  A specific back to education scheme for construction sector workers aged under 25 must be introduced and the State must provide training and upskilling courses for alternative industries to construction through F&Aacute;S and third level institutions.  It is also vital that retraining is provided in the area of construction to allow workers to continue in the energy saving and renewable energy sectors.</P>
        <P>The predicament of C2 workers must be addressed.  One initiative could be to allow stamps for the previous five years to be considered for welfare payments, rather than the two-year criterion currently applied.  It is also essential that next year the Government frontloads infrastructure projects which can employ workers from the construction sector and increase our competitiveness, including transport, schools, creches, social housing and hospital building.</P>
        <P>As indicated, the loss of jobs extends beyond construction.  Our manufacturing sector has been hard pressed for a number of years.  Last Friday, I listened with interest at an ISME conference as employers explained to a representative from a major bank how they had felt ignored by the banking sector in recent years.  They described how tough it was to get start-up loans or loans for equipment and expansion and how the banks did not want to know them unless they were dealing in property.  Unfortunately, we are all paying the price for the Government&rsquo;s love affair with property and speculators.</P>
        <P>This does not mean, however, that we do not have the potential to turn around the economic crisis and start creating jobs as opposed to losing them.  My party colleagues and I have highlighted in particular our underperforming indigenous export market.  A report published by Forf&aacute;s in 2006 showed that foreign-owned firms were responsible for 90.2% of exports from this State in that year.  The value of these exports, which include manufacturing and internationally-traded services, amounted to &euro;96.4 billion whereas the total value of exports of Irish-owned manufacturing and internationally-traded services firms amounted to only &euro;10.5 billion.  This area is crying out for Government intervention and stimulation.</P>
        <P>The Government can take a number of initiatives to support the export market and stimulate jobs in the manufacturing sector.  These include: helping Irish producers to access export markets outside the United States and Britain, for example, by providing language and local regulation supports; increasing the use of Irish embassies to access local market knowledge and management personnel; and increasing training of sales personnel with a good mix of industry background and technical knowledge.</P><Col N="837"/>
        <P>Community employment schemes are another area of importance.  These schemes are offered to unemployed workers at a marginally higher rate of payment than basic unemployment benefit.  They can be useful for the community in terms of the service they provide, and to the individual by keeping him or her in work mode and offering new training.  In seeking an increase in the number of CE schemes in the months ahead as the unemployment rate rises, I add a note of caution.  Many of those who are losing their jobs have children in expensive child care facilities which they can no longer afford.  Those entering community employment schemes will, therefore, require child care.  More community-based child care places must be provided as a matter of urgency because the lack of affordable child care is one of the principal obstacles facing those who are seeking employment.  Child care frequently costs the equivalent of a mortgage and families cannot afford to pay for it.  I hope the Government will take serious action to tackle this problem in the months ahead.</P>
        <P>With all the furore surrounding the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act passed in the House last week, the people who are suffering most in these times of turmoil, namely, those who have lost their jobs or are on the of losing their jobs, are largely ignored.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in were out first thing on Tuesday morning last calling for the Government to introduce a similar package of emergency measures to protect this group of people from home repossessions, and throughout last week we called on the Government to examine the issue of job losses.</P>
        <P>This week, however, the headlines have changed as media reports focus on the budget deficit figure and what cuts will have to be made in next week&rsquo;s budget to manage the economy.  If a decision can be made to secure a sector that benefited handsomely from the boom and was the cause of its own threatened demise &mdash; although I accept the necessity of the Government&rsquo;s decision of last week &mdash; it would be morally reprehensible not to invest the same effort and energy in solving unemployment and the problems faced by those who have become unemployed.  I hope the Government takes due consideration of this fact before it formulates any cuts in social welfare next week or makes any decisions that could in any way affect the likelihood of jobs being made available next year, for example, by cutting infrastructure projects.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the remainder of the debate and hope the House will pass this laudable motion.  I commend Deputy Penrose and his colleagues for placing it before the House.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I welcome this debate and, in particular, this opportunity for the Government to set out how and why it is well placed to meet the challenges that face Ireland and that face most other major western economies as a result of today&rsquo;s difficult global economic climate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I begin by acknowledging the unwelcome increase in the numbers on the live register.  As a small open economy, Ireland is vulnerable to the fallout from the current economic turbulence, particularly the recent and ongoing severe fluctuations on the world&rsquo;s stock markets.  The turbulence has affected major banks and businesses across the globe, including those here at home.  This day last week we introduced legislation in this House aimed at addressing the difficulties affecting our own banking sector.  In my contribution to the debate, I pointed out that the importance of maintaining liquidity within the Irish banking sector was not only key to the ongoing ability of our banks to do business but also to our small, medium and large enterprises.  Their ability to get and retain credit impacts directly on the ability of their businesses to survive and therefore keep their employees in a job.  The decision we took in the House last week was not an easy one but it is one that has ensured we are not debating a significantly more serious set of circumstances in the House this evening.  That said, our actions last week are of little comfort to any individual or family directly affected by the loss of employment or income during the past number of months.  It will take further difficult decisions by this Government in the coming weeks to make secure their futures and to ensure we return to stable economic <Col N="839"/>and job growth in the short to medium term.  In bringing forward its budget by six weeks, the Government has made it clear that we are determined to make those necessary decisions.</P>
        <P>During the past two decades we have witnessed an unprecedented and extraordinary economic performance in the Irish economy.  This performance has seen living standards raised to a level that would have been unimaginable a generation ago.  It was a period which, as at the end of the second quarter of 2008, saw an additional 600,000 people in employment, reflecting a rise of more than 40% compared to the same period ten years ago.</P>
        <P>This has resulted in the creation of the first generation of Irish people who have experienced the opportunity to work and build a prosperous future in their own country.  It has happened because this Government has embraced the opportunity of creating a confident, dynamic and highly skilled workforce capable of competing in the international economy.  As a result, success has been built and sustained and today we have an economy of which we can be proud and an employment market well placed to meet and tackle the current economic challenges.</P>
        <P>In a global knowledge-based economy we must increasingly recognise human talent and creativity as a key resource and the principal sustainable source of competitive advantage.  Given the particular global turbulence-related challenges we face today, how we unlock and further expand this talent and creativity in our workplaces has become an even more crucial issue.</P>
        <P>Against this background, I first want to turn to the measures the Government is putting in place to ensure that those who become unemployed are provided with effective employment services and training supports to help them to return to employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">F&Aacute;S, as the national training and employment authority, provides a range of proactive job-related services, supports and programmes to assist individuals to remain in and return to the labour market.  The agency also promotes workforce development by upgrading the competencies and qualifications of individuals and by providing and facilitating targeted training programmes and services to both employers and employees.  F&Aacute;S is working closely with the Department of Social and Family Affairs so they can together respond quickly to the rising live register numbers.  For example, F&Aacute;S, together with the local employment services provided by area-based partnerships, is currently gearing up its employment services to provide increased capacity for expected increased referrals from the live register.  In addition, F&Aacute;S will provide a range of certified, short, flexible, modular programmes designed to upskill redundant workers in order that they can enhance their prospect of securing employment.  A number of programmes are already in place and the frequency and range of these will be expanded over the coming months.  A range of actions are also being implemented by F&Aacute;S for those affected by the construction slowdown, including focusing on providing retraining opportunities for redundant construction workers in emerging areas within the construction sector.  This will include retraining in the following areas of activity &mdash; the installation of sustainable technologies, environmental activity, and compliance and regulatory work.  F&Aacute;S will also assist individuals in any way it can in seeking employment abroad in construction in other EU countries.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has a specific policy in place to deal with redundancies and-or company closures.  It offers a tailored approach, as early as possible, to the workers affected with a view to assisting them to access alternative employment.  This applies to workers in all sectors, including construction.  F&Aacute;S has a fast track redundancy notification system in place with my Department to ensure a speedy and appropriate response is provided to redundant workers.  Each response is tailored on a case-by-case basis.  As part of the consultation process in the case of company closures and major redundancies, F&Aacute;S establishes the scale of the redundancies, the skills profile of the employees affected, the number of years&rsquo; experience of the employees, their level of education and any other information deemed relevant to the particular case in question.</P><Col N="840"/>
        <P>In addressing the issue of redundancies, F&Aacute;S liaises with other relevant agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the city and county enterprise boards and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It also works closely with the agencies to identify and support individuals who wish to start their own businesses.  There is also active engagement with the unemployed after three months on the live register to assist them to progress towards employment, training or active labour market programmes.</P>
        <P>I referred to the actions F&Aacute;S is carrying out in regard to retraining those formerly employed in the construction sector.  We are all aware there has been a significant downturn in construction-related activity since the start of this year.  The construction sector is currently undergoing a major structural change.  Resulting from this structural change there has been a significant increase in the numbers of people within the construction sector who have been made redundant and also a corresponding increase in the number of apprentices being made redundant.  To respond to these challenges we have instructed F&Aacute;S, as the national training and employment authority, to place a particular focus on providing support and retraining opportunities to construction workers and apprentices who have been made redundant.</P>
        <P>A recent F&Aacute;S report while recognising that the fall in construction sector employment can be attributed to the downturn in the house-building sector also states that this fall will be partially offset by an expansion in other subsectors of the construction sector, including those such as housing repairs and maintenance, general contracting and civil engineering.  Since its publication, F&Aacute;S has begun the process of implementing the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  As part of this process F&Aacute;S, in addition to the usual supports it provides to redundant workers, has established a training fund to enable it provide a timely response to identified training-retraining needs for low skilled and redundant craft workers from the construction sector.  It is intended that this will enable individuals to secure a speedy return to work or, where this cannot be secured, to provide relevant upskilling opportunities in order that job seekers can secure employment in alternative sectors.  F&Aacute;S is currently focusing on providing retraining opportunities for redundant construction workers in emerging areas such as the installation of energy efficient and renewable technologies within that sector.</P>
        <P>In regard to redundant apprentices, my Department and F&Aacute;S have been actively examining this issue and have put in place a series of actions to facilitate redundant apprentices in completing their studies.  These include redundant apprentices being allowed to progress to their next off-the-job phase of training without having to do the next on-the-job phase.  F&Aacute;S has also established a register of redundant workers by trade in order to identify these people at the earliest possible point in time and we have prioritised the need to locate an employer to sponsor the completion of the apprentices&rsquo; off-the-job training.  In addition to these initiatives the traditional employment support services provided by F&Aacute;S are available to apprentices who have been made redundant.</P>
        <P>My Department and F&Aacute;S will continue to monitor the trends and activities in the industry and will work with all the relevant stakeholders to ensure timely and satisfactory responses to assist redundant construction workers and apprentices to secure alternative employment whether in the construction sector or another area of the economy.</P>
        <P>Further help for those who have become distanced from the labour market for some time and who are seeking to re-enter it is provided by the community employment scheme, CE.  CE is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed-term basis.  The programme helps unemployed people to progress <Col N="841"/>to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and assists them in developing both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>The Government is investing &euro;377 million this year in CE with a view to maintaining overall numbers on F&Aacute;S schemes at 2007 levels.  There are currently 22,400 people employed on CE schemes nationally.   In delivering these places, F&Aacute;S operates flexibly in the management of this allocation in order to maximise progression to the labour market, while also facilitating the support of community services.</P>
        <P>I will now deal with the importance of skills and human capital development for our competitiveness.  The continuing development of Ireland&rsquo;s education and training systems will be key to maintaining and sustaining our economic success.  That success is, now more than ever, dependent on our continued ability to produce individuals who possess the necessary skills and qualifications to succeed in this era of change.</P>
        <P>We must ensure that our education and training systems continue to harness the collective skills and talents of our workforce.  We must ensure that our systems meet the changing needs of our society from an economic and social perspective.  In short, we must continue to invest in the development of our greatest asset, namely, our people.  It is of paramount importance to continue to focus attention on developing the skills of our population in order that members of the labour force can consistently adapt and upgrade their skills to meet emerging opportunities and challenges.</P>
        <P>We must encourage greater participation in lifelong learning by facilitating and motivating people to increase their skill levels and qualifications.  It is no longer the case that learning should be seen as something that is complete once a person finishes his or her initial formal education.  We must all look to continue our skills development throughout our working lives.  Lifelong learning is key to our continued success.  It is also vital in ensuring that we remain one of the world&rsquo;s leading knowledge economies.  That is why the Government is committed in the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, the national development plan and, more recently, the national skills strategy to continue to invest significantly in the development of the workforce.</P>
        <P>The continued support and enhancement of measures to increase the number of people who are upskilling and participating in lifelong learning will be essential if we are to realise the vision contained in the national skills strategy.  The Government, through the training programmes run by F&Aacute;S and Skillnets, is committed to investing in lifelong learning opportunities for the workforce.  In order to be truly effective, however, this will require a similar commitment from the social partners and individuals.  If we are to succeed, we must all fully embrace the opportunities and challenges that lifelong learning presents to us individually and, collectively, as a nation.</P>
        <P>Despite current global turbulence, we nonetheless remain determined to further develop the country&rsquo;s economy and create the right conditions for fostering growth in the business sector.  We must not lose sight of the fact that we must ensure the continued development of our enterprise sector even in these challenging times.  On a macro level, Enterprise Ireland, at the direction of the Government, is committed to the development of world-class Irish companies so that they achieve strong positions in global markets.  The agency works effectively with both manufacturing and internationally-trading services companies and provides a variety of financial and non-financial supports to enable their development and growth in international markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt that future prosperity will be founded on the development and growth of Irish-owned companies.  This vision can be realised if the challenges faced by Irish enterprise are met head on.  In that context, the development of the strength and depth of our indigenous <Col N="842"/>sector will be critical if we are to return to the levels of prosperity achieved in recent years.  We will need to foster the emergence of significant numbers of new indigenous businesses that have the potential to achieve significant growth, are highly innovative, embrace and develop new technologies, are export driven and, above all else, are productive and sustainable.  We will only be able to foster the emergence of such enterprises if the operating environment for business, particularly smaller concerns, is supportive.  This will continue to be a key focus of Government policy.</P>
        <P>The Government has put in place policies and programmes that encourage the emergence of new business creations and facilitate long-term business survival.  Examples of the actions we have taken include the positioning of our tax system as one of the most supportive of business in the world; the development of Ireland as a knowledge-based economy through the dedication of significant Exchequer resources to the promotion of research and development; the introduction of the better regulation programme to tackle regulatory burdens, particularly those faced by the business community; and the adoption of new strategies to support the enterprise sector &mdash; including small businesses &mdash; based on the reports of the enterprise strategy group and the Small Business Forum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The level of entrepreneurship in Ireland is strong.  The 2007 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Report for Ireland shows that the number of entrepreneurs in Ireland increased during the past year to the extent that 2,700 individuals were setting up new businesses each month throughout the country.  Some 1,000 of these were women.  If, however, we are to build a much greater number of competitive and innovative companies, then many new businesses will have to be created in the coming years.  The challenge is not only to generate a high level of new businesses being started but also to maximise the number of innovative businesses among them that subsequently develop to achieve high growth.  The education and training sector will play a critical role in developing entrepreneurial mindsets and in equipping current and future entrepreneurs with the skills necessary to successfully strategically position new enterprises and then manage their subsequent development and growth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The SME sector is making an important contribution to our economic prosperity, with over 250,000 small businesses employing approximately 800,000 people in operation here.  The county and city enterprise boards have a clearly defined role as the principal deliverers of State support to the micro-enterprise sector.  As a result of their strong regional presence, they have been to the forefront of Ireland&rsquo;s recent economic success and are now well placed to help micro-enterprises deal with challenging economic circumstances.  The enterprise boards have an excellent track record in tapping into local entrepreneurial potential and their focus has increasingly been on the development of sustainable growth-orientated local enterprise, which can deliver high quality job creation without displacement or dead weight.  The current parameters within which  the enterprise boards operate enable them to deliver valuable assistance to business start-ups, with good growth and employment potential.</P>
        <P>The work of the Government, though IDA Ireland, in fostering the growth and development of business in this country is also core to the continuing development of the economy, particularly during these difficult times.  The level of foreign direct investment, FDI, in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world.  When measuring FDI job creation relative to population size, Ireland is ranked in the top three locations.  At present, the FDI sector here comprises approximately 1,000 companies which employ 136,000 people directly, with a substantial multiple in indirect employment.</P>
        <P>The quality of investments from global companies into Ireland is of the highest standard, reflecting the remarkable evolution of the business ecosystem in Ireland as international competition and economic conditions here have developed.  In the past year, Google, Cisco,<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="843"/>GlaxoSmithKline, PepsiCo and Georgia Tech invested here.  In recent days, and despite ongoing global economic turbulence, such prestigious international names as Cook Medical and Facebook have invested in Ireland.  This is clear evidence of evolution to which I refer.  Some 114 new investments were won in 2007, which was an excellent result.</P>
        <P>In keeping with a cohesive national strategy of collaboration among all stakeholders, we continue the economic transformation of Ireland into a leading 21st century knowledge economy and we look forward to securing new projects, investments, research and development operations and some broader research collaborations again in 2008 and beyond.  The focus of the transformation must shift from pure employment numbers to take account of the job scope and value added to the economy.</P>
        <P>We are now winning higher value-added FDI in new and emerging business areas such as Internet and media business.  We are also targeting the high-growth clean-tech sector and have established a dedicated team to drive this initiative.</P>

	<P>Ireland continues to be one of the most attractive places in the world as a location for global business.  With our highly educated, skilled and adaptable workforce, our strong focus on research and development and knowledge, and our can-do, responsive and open attitude, we remain a location of choice.  As a small open economy, Ireland welcomes the continued strong interest demonstrated by many of the world&rsquo;s leading companies in investing and expanding here.  Ireland has transformed as an economy in recent years.  We are well positioned to continue this transformation in the future.  We are pro-business, pro-European and proud to be always to the forefront of the minds of global business leaders as they make critical investment decisions.  Despite the economic turbulence being experienced, a reasonably strong investment pipeline, coupled with our positive reputation with some of the world&rsquo;s leading companies, leads us to be optimistic that we will continue to secure for Ireland the best in innovation and investments from around the globe.</P>
        <P>As Members are aware, good macroeconomic and sound enterprise policies generate new, sustainable jobs and advance the standard of living of citizens.  Against the background of what is undoubtedly a challenging global economic climate, I contend that the Government has in place the correct balance of policies and flexibility of approach to ensure that we continue to not only maintain the current high level of employment numbers, but also to generate new employment opportunities.  In so doing, we will maintain the social and economic advantages that have been acquired for this country during the past decade.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and will focus my remarks on the vital issue of lifelong learning.  As Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning, I fully recognise the importance of education and training in terms of the positive impact it has on individuals and on the economic prospects of an entire country.  In Ireland today, our ability to compete with international competitors is dependent on the skills and competencies of our workforce.  We are internationally considered to have a workforce that is flexible, innovative, committed and highly skilled.  We would all agree that these strengths of our workforce have been the bedrock of our remarkable economic transformation.</P>
        <P>Events over the past few weeks, in particular the current financial turmoil which is gripping the entire world economy, demonstrate not only the pace of change but also the sheer scale of globalisation in the 21st century.  The quality and intensity of global competition is increasing all the time.  Our competitors will continue to work hard to make their business climates and infrastructures more attractive to global investors and many will rely on labour cost advantages.  The developed world is beginning to wake up to the former sleepy economic giants of China, India and Brazil in terms of global competitiveness and investment.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a small and open economy and we are feeling the affects of the present economic turmoil.  However, we remain an attractive location for high-end, skill-intensive operations.  If we are to continue to prosper in these increasingly challenging times, it is pivotal that we take prudent action now in key areas that will enable us to safeguard our future economic and social development.</P>
        <P>The skills and competencies level of our labour force is one such area.  The Government firmly believes that our future success can only be guaranteed by continuing our policy of investing in our education and training systems.  Through our primary, secondary and third level education system, combined with massive Government investment in vocational education and training, Ireland is well placed to take her place on the world stage as a star performer in the global knowledge economy.</P>
        <P>We must continue to produce highly-educated and skilled individuals.  We must ensure that the country has a labour force with the ability to not only meet the needs of enterprises but also, more importantly, to allow Ireland to quickly respond to emerging opportunities that will present themselves.  In short, Ireland must create and develop competitive advantage in terms of the skills and qualifications of our labour force.  This will be key to maintaining our success and will allow us to continue to compete in the increasingly competitive global marketplace.</P>
        <P>Lifelong learning will, therefore, play a key role in enabling Ireland to remain competitive in the future.  Participation by adults in education and training is still significantly underdeveloped here compared with other economies.  We must, therefore, encourage greater participation in lifelong learning by facilitating and motivating people to increase their skill levels and qualifications.  Key to achieving this goal is our national skills strategy.</P>
        <P>The national skills strategy was published in March 2007 and was completed by the expert group on future skills needs in response to the Government&rsquo;s request for the group to undertake a comprehensive analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market and skills needs to 2020.  The results of the analysis contain an ambitious vision for the skills profile in Ireland in 2020.  It shows that if Ireland is to progress ahead of our competitors, we need to increase our focus on skills development at a number of levels.</P>
        <P>We need to upskill by at least one level on the national framework of qualifications, an additional 500,000 people by 2020.  The strategy clearly shows that the majority of these people, in excess of 330,000, are currently considered to be low skilled and, therefore, the implementation of the vision needs to have a special focus on the low skilled.  The national skills strategy <Col N="845"/>has helped us to target specific skills and sectors that will become increasingly important in the next few years.  It has allowed us to identify and address specific gaps in our skills base and will help us to build an education and training system that will allow us to quickly adapt and respond to the challenging global business environment.</P>
        <P>The achievement of the ambitious targets contained in the national skills strategy requires a co-ordinated implementation process.  As Minister with responsibility for lifelong learning, I have responsibility for overseeing this entire process and bringing together the relevant Departments to ensure a co-ordinated response.  In this regard, I chair the interdepartmental committee for the implementation of the national skills strategy.  This committee, which consists of senior officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Finance, is responsible for preparing an implementation plan.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that this plan will examine the existing provision of education and training to ensure a co-ordinated and efficient provision between the education and training sectors.  The implementation plan will also determine the key areas and initiatives that will require additional focus in order to achieve the objectives of the national skills strategy.  I intend that this implementation plan will be completed by early next year.</P>
        <P>While work is progressing on developing the implementation plan for the national skills strategy, the Government has already taken action to assist those who have been affected by the significant downturn in activity in the construction sector.  F&Aacute;S has been instructed, as the national training and employment authority, to place particular focus on providing support and retraining opportunities to construction workers and apprentices who have been made redundant as a result of the downturn in the construction sector.  This focus is in addition to the normal employment services support F&Aacute;S provides to people who have been made redundant.</P>
        <P>Specifically, F&Aacute;S has established a training fund that will allow it respond in a prompt manner by providing training and retraining opportunities to redundant construction workers to enable them gain alternative employment.  F&Aacute;S currently provides upskilling opportunities in emerging areas within the construction sector, including the installation of renewable energy technologies, to redundant construction workers.  The Government is committed to assisting in whatever way possible construction workers who have been made redundant.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I also have responsibility for the programmes delivered under the auspices of the Department of Education and Science, I want to take this opportunity to mention the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS.  This scheme is a second chance education and training programme, which provides courses of up to two years&rsquo; duration for unemployed people.  The scheme is delivered locally by the VECs across 99 centres nationwide and provides education and training to some 5,000 participants.  It has proved to be very successful, with VTOS progression statistics for 2007 showing, where the course was of two years&rsquo; duration, over 72% of participants who completed the programme in that year had progressed to either employment or further education and training.  The scheme has proved to be a great success in opening up learning and progression opportunities for people who have been marginalised by unemployment.</P>
        <P>Our future competitiveness and success as an economy and society lies within our hands.  Targeting our investment in education and training to achieve the objectives of the national skills strategy will provide Ireland with competitive advantage in the key area of skills.  Ireland&rsquo;s workforce will continue to be the basis of our success.  I have the utmost confidence in the ability of our workforce to successfully compete with the best in the world.  The Government for its part is committed to investing in education and training and the continued promotion of lifelong learning.  However, in order for us to guarantee our future success, we all, including <Col N="846"/>the Government, the social partners, our education and training providers and each and every one of us, must truly embrace the benefits of lifelong learning by actively participating in it when the opportunity arises.</P>
        <P>The interdepartmental committee, consisting of representatives of the three Departments I already mentioned, has met on two occasions.  We are finalising an implementation plan which it is hoped to publish early in the new year.  This will set out a vision for the implementation of the national skills strategy and will oblige all involved in lifelong learning to play their role, the institutes of technology, third level colleges, the VECs, the further education sector, F&Aacute;S, Skillnet and all those involved in training.  All these partners, the workforce, learners and society in general will come together behind the implementation plan and set about upskilling the workforce and achieving the ambitious targets set out in the national skills strategy by 2020.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Labour Party motion, which addresses a serious issue.  My party has tabled additional amendments that may be accommodated as the debate proceeds.  However, I do not think we can accept the Government&rsquo;s amendments.  This issue is becoming increasingly serious and has to be addressed through the range of initiatives which have been set out in the motion and my party&rsquo;s amendments.</P>
        <P>Unemployment figures are increasing.  The Government has to acknowledge this problem and accept its responsibility for solving it because one of its functions is job creation.  Tonight&rsquo;s debate presents an opportunity to discuss ideas rather than criticise the Government.  That is what Deputy Penrose and his colleagues have done thus far but the T&aacute;naiste has rehearsed the same speech which I have heard at least ten times already.  Earlier today, I attended a meeting with IDA Ireland at which the same historical figures were thrown about.  During the meetings that the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment held with F&Aacute;S, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards, we heard the same 11 year old references.  A lot has changed in the past 11 years so there is no point in comparing job figures.  Let us deal with the problems that will arise in the coming months and forget about clapping ourselves on the back for all that was done.  We need to ask what new ideas we can try.  The Opposition is here to discuss these ideas with a view to finding a positive outcome.  Several months ago, the joint committee invited the various organisations to discuss these ideas but all we received were history presentations.  There was no discussion on new strategies for job creation.  While I hope next week&rsquo;s budget will reveal new ideas, we should start to discuss them now so that we can reach agreement on what will work.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste referred to pensioners and the new measures that F&Aacute;S is implementing.  I am not aware of these measures.  We are told it is compiling a database for matching those who have lost jobs with new employment.  It made one change so that it can avoid working on-site to move to the next phase of education.  No other new ideas are forthcoming.</P>

	<P>She did not say anything.  She is the do-nothing Minister.  The Deputy should read her contribution again.  F&Aacute;S appeared before the joint committee on two occasions to speak about reports and meetings with the Construction Industry Federation, yet nothing happened.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="847"/>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  In April 2007, prior to the general election, F&Aacute;S set up a working group to consider this area.  It knew that problems had arisen but kept quiet about them.  Here we are, 18 months later, with no new proposal.  What is happening?</P>
        <P>We all agree that county enterprise boards do excellent work but most of them have received no money since July.  They create jobs and achieve value for money, yet they are not funded.  We have met various organisations throughout the country and have found that the funding has dried up.  Can we not give money to the people who create jobs?</P>
        <P>We spoke previously about the necessity for local authorities to purchase land to provide low cost sites to people who want to expand or move their businesses and create new jobs.  This week, however, several county councils have been instructed not to purchase land.  They were told to cancel the deals, even though they had almost been completed, because all bets are off and there is no money to spend on land for sites.  We will cut off the opportunity to create jobs because we will have pulled the plug on local authorities and enterprise boards.  It is an absolute disgrace.</P>
        <P>The rules on enterprise boards are too restrictive.  They were acceptable when the economy was growing but the environment has changed.  We have repeatedly asked the Government to investigate whether the rules can be changed so that enterprise boards can create employment when they finally receive money.</P>
        <P>The motion refers to the school building programme.  Lifelong learning starts with child care and primary school.  We are failing young people because they are not being given the opportunity to engage properly with education.  A proposal that leads to investment in schools would be a major help in winning them over at an early stage in their lives.  It would also solve two problems at the same time.  This proposal has received widespread attention over the past seven months but it was not mentioned in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s speech.  She could at least have told us it cannot be done.  I ask for some reaction to what we suggest.  If we are wrong, we will put our hands up, but we should at least be told something.</P>
        <P>The proposed insulation scheme deserves consideration.  Again, however, there was no comment from the T&aacute;naiste.  In recent months I have regularly spoken about activation schemes for getting people back to work.  Jobs initiatives and community employment schemes do not cater for the newly unemployed.  We need solutions that put newly unemployed, highly skilled and motivated people back to work as soon as possible because the social and financial costs of keeping them at home are very high.  However, the T&aacute;naiste made no mention of this.  We were told that the budget may include a provision in this area but we could have discussed that tonight.  Is it not a good idea to match up work that needs to be done in the community with people who have the necessary skills?  There is plenty of work to be done on local authority housing, schools, playgrounds and parks.  Imagination is needed in matching those with skills to the work that is needed in terms of maintenance and construction or running voluntary organisations and community centres.</P>
        <P>We must invest in incubator units.  The Government has received 56 applications for these units but I am confident the money is not available for all of them.  Can we find the money to guarantee them?  We also must find some way of supporting small and medium enterprises because these will create jobs in the future.  Can we introduce tax deferrals, reduce Government charges or offer a three-year tax break to new businesses?  We could establish a grant system to create new jobs.  Does the Government have other ideas for creating jobs?  What new functions have been given to organisations with responsibilities on behalf of the Government for job creation?  I do not believe the T&aacute;naiste has given them guidance in this regard.  We have to generate jobs.</P><Col N="848"/>
        <P>In regard to red tape, we speak about competitiveness but our businesses are at a disadvantage because of the cost of energy, wages, insurance and council charges.  These issues must be addressed but the T&aacute;naiste ignored them tonight.  I do not seek major change.  Simple measures can make a big difference in terms of allowing businesses to compete on the export market and create new jobs.  Too many businesses fall through the gap in terms of receiving aid.  It is the Government&rsquo;s job to help them because we must get people back to work.  We cannot afford sustained increases in live register numbers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Labour Party on moving this motion.  I certainly will not be supporting the amendment proposed by the T&aacute;naiste.  I particularly object to the claim that the Government is bringing forward the 2009 budget by six weeks to address the effects of the dramatic downturn in the global economy.  I understand the budget is being brought forward so we can discuss the deterioration in the Irish economy, which is solely due to mismanagement by the Taoiseach and former Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>The ESRI&rsquo;s quarterly review, which was published today, refers to the global crisis. However, the mess in which we find ourselves is not purely due to that global crisis but also of our own making.  We recently heard the announcement, shocking for anybody in a precarious position or who feels his or her job may not be secure, that by the end of 2009 there will be 300,000 unemployed.  The ESRI stated today that it had to revise its projections for the economy downwards.  Nobody knows where the statistics will go.  The figure of 300,000 unemployed is shocking.  There will be human stories behind these numbers, although not of the same type we had in the 1980s, because many of those who are unemployed today find themselves living in an economy in which the cost of living, rent and mortgage repayments are high.  Some will probably find themselves in negative equity, which is a serious worry for them.</P>
        <P>Many of those who find themselves unemployed are younger people, especially those who have been in the construction sector.  In recent weeks, as mentioned by Deputy English, representatives of F&Aacute;S have appeared at the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  They have recognised that there are many young people who left school prior to their leaving certificate or with a bare leaving certificate, went into the construction industry, made good money and had a good experience but now find themselves with low skills and unable to compete in the workforce.  I heard the Minister&rsquo;s speech this evening and also heard representatives of F&Aacute;S talking about investing in these people and ensuring they are retrained and their skills are improved, but I see very little of this.  Yes, there are opportunities in housing insulation and driving HGVs and we have heard that there are gaps in the health sector, but we need to see these people being trained and their skills improved in order that they can avail of these possibilities.</P>
        <P>Many will go abroad.  At the committee we spoke with the representatives of F&Aacute;S about working to ensure those in apprenticeships complete them.  It is very important for these young people that they at least have their certification.  There are opportunities in London, where construction is taking place in preparation for the Olympic Games.  Young people who have not yet completed their apprenticeships should be matched with opportunities in the United Kingdom and encouraged to complete their apprenticeships and obtain qualifications.  These issues were discussed in committee meetings under the chairmanship of Deputy Penrose, yet I see little of this occurring.  It would be a positive contribution which would benefit the young people concerned.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, spoke about retraining and raising skill levels and about education for life.  However, according to an EU survey conducted in 2005, only 8% of Irish persons between the ages of 25 and 64 years were in receipt of any form of education in <Col N="849"/>the period prior to the survey.  This compares to 35% in Sweden, 29% in the United Kingdom and 28% in Denmark and is well below the EU target of 12.5%.  Thus, the Minister of State has a long way to go to reach his targets.  He also referred to competitiveness, an extremely important issue.  We must ensure we return to our previous position because we have slipped badly in our competitiveness rating.  The Minister of State said tonight it was in our own hands.  That is true, but we have seen the Government ignore this issue and allow our rating to slip year-on-year, according to the annual reports of the National Competitiveness Council, which will affect investment in this country.  Those running businesses who are hoping to employ people here will consider this factor.  Unless we address the issue of competitiveness and ensure Ireland is a place where one can run a business efficiently and effectively, we will not be able to tackle rising unemployment rates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this motion.  In many ways it is similar to the one on the economy which we introduced two weeks ago.  It is an opportunity, as Deputy English said, to share some ideas, spur on some new thinking in the Government and try to do what we were elected to do &mdash; to offer leadership and initiative when times are tough.  Times are tough for many, whether they be employers or employees.  Employees are feeling the pinch from all directions.  They realise that employers are trying to cut costs by cutting the wage bill; they are also looking at increasing unemployment numbers.</P>
        <P>The last ten years of government were primarily about maintaining a momentum that had been created through sensible policies and the development of a competitive economy where people wanted to come and do business and in which Irish businesses were encouraged to develop, grow and invest.  A combination of investor confidence, good education and a range of other factors meant that all the Government had to do was to keep pushing the snowball along as it continued to gather momentum and grow in size.  All of that has changed.  The decisions taken during my ten years in this House were often ignored by the public.  They were taken for granted because they were not seen to be relevant.  People just got on with their lives and enjoyed the success and confidence that was the new Ireland.  That has all changed.  In the same way that people turn to other institutions in times of difficulty, they are now turning to the House.  They expect us to give leadership and provide new ideas and hope about where Ireland is going.  The level of uncertainty, among small business people in particular, but also among employees, is extraordinary.  I receive telephone calls from small business people in Cork who are afraid there will be a dramatic increase in rates in order that local authority expenditure in the city can be maintained at a similar level to last year&rsquo;s, because there will be a 10% reduction in the money coming from the Government to local authorities.  Business people will have to pick up the tab, because they are the easy sop politically.</P>
        <P>We need inspiration, leadership, ideas and honest discussion from the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We still need to deal with the fundamentals in terms of where the economy is going and what is needed from the Government.  I have a few suggestions.  From a national point of view, what must be our priority in the budget next week is that we do our job and look after the most vulnerable in Ireland.  I am talking about homeless people, disabled people and those in low-income households.  We must ensure primarily that people can keep their jobs and their basic State supports to which they are entitled and which we have a responsibility to provide.  We must also prioritise expenditure to stimulate economic growth and development by increasing competitiveness.  Broadband and IT is an obvious area about which I keep banging the drum.  One million houses in Ireland have a computer, but only 57% of them have access to broadband.  Among European countries, Ireland has the highest rate of orders over the Internet.  A total of 27% of all orders made in Ireland are placed over the Internet.  This happens in spite of a poor IT infrastructure which needs to be improved and developed.  My city has twice the national average of unemployment.  Unemployment in Cork city is now at 12% compared to a national average of 6%.  We want the Government to support the big idea in my city, which is about developing a docklands project on a brownfield site, which at 166 ha is probably the biggest in Europe.  Investors are lining up to get involved.  In the past the Government promised tax incentives, but we have yet to see them.  Next week we need to see those incentives to try to get the kind of investment in Ireland&rsquo;s second city needed to create the vast number of jobs that project can create in a relatively short space of time.  There could be up to 20,000 jobs on that site.  However, because of the silence on the tax incentives that had been promised and because of the Government&rsquo;s deferral of funding it promised under the gateway funds to provide access to that site via two bridges, the project is now stalled even though we have been preparing for it for the past five years.</P>
        <P>Both local and national actions can be taken.  I have not heard anything from the Government this evening that indicates new thinking or commitments to inspire confidence.</P>

	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this matter.  I will take every opportunity that comes to raise the scandal that senior HSE executives are about to be paid &euro;1.4 million in bonuses.  They will receive these bonuses in addition to their salaries and the amounts will range from &euro;10,000 to &euro;80,000.  For example, the chief executive earns &euro;380,000 and may get a bonus of up to &euro;80,000, which would bring his pay to &euro;1,700 every working day or &euro;8,500 per week.  I am disgusted with this decision which shows breathtaking arrogance at a time when there are such savage cutbacks on the front line of the health services.</P>
        <P>How can I explain this decision to the woman who came into my office on Monday, crying over her physically challenged 24 year old son who was attending a training centre workshop and was getting &euro;20 a week plus a meal?  He came home crying because he no longer gets his &euro;20 a week, which was equivalent to his wages.  It would take him eight years to earn what the chief executive of the Health Service Executive earns in one week.</P>
        <P>What about the cutbacks in home help?  No wheelchairs, medical aids or appliances are available for people in desperate need.  There are cutbacks in respite care for parents at their wits&rsquo; end caring for their disadvantaged daughter or son at home.  What about the disabled <Col N="851"/>person who cannot get a grant for a stair lift or a downstairs bathroom because there is no money available for that?  Doctors have warned that 20 people a week are in desperate pain and will suffer as orthopaedic operations are reduced to save money.</P>
        <P>For the period up to the end of September there were more people on trolleys than for the whole of last year.  In University College Hospital Galway for the month of April 2007 there were 183 people on trolleys and this year there were 444 people on trolleys for the same month.  The HSE has cancelled the flu injections promised for medical card holders aged more than 50.  I could mention several other matters, including cancer scandals and 250,000 bed days lost in hospitals, which is the equivalent of a 600-bed hospital like Beaumont being closed for one year.  The list is endless.  The Minister tells us there are no cutbacks on the front line, but all the cutbacks are on the front line.</P>
        <P>The blame for the current health crisis must be laid clearly on the shoulders of the Government.  It squandered taxpayers&rsquo; money over the past five years on many pet projects, including &euro;6 million on electronic voting and several millions on the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo; and PPARS.  Now the people on the front line of the health service are suffering.  Where is the Minister for Health and Children?  I call on her to step in and stop this rot.  I do not apologise to anybody for raising this matter and I will take every opportunity to raise this breathtaking scandal of HSE executives awarding themselves &euro;1.4 million in bonuses at a time when people on the front line of the health service are suffering.</P>

The primary function of the review body is to advise the Government from time to time on the general levels of remuneration appropriate to certain public sector posts, including higher management grades in the health service not covered by the public service benchmarking body process.</P>
        <P>A number of senior management grades in the HSE are eligible to participate in the performance-related award scheme.  Specifically, the grades included are those of national director, assistant national director and hospital network manager.  The level of awards made to individuals is solely a matter for the board of the HSE which implements the principles set out by the review body.  In this regard, awards should be related to the achievement of highly demanding and challenging targets.  The scheme provides for the payment of awards after the year-end, when it has been demonstrated that the prior agreed objectives have been met.</P>
        <P>In line with the recommendations of the review body there is consistency in the levels of awards available to employees within the following limits: maximum awards not to exceed 20% of salary of any individual and an overall cost limit for awards of 10% of payroll for the relevant groups where feasible.  The payment of the performance-related awards for work carried out in 2007 beyond what is seen as the normal ongoing requirements of the job was considered and approved by the HSE&rsquo;s remuneration and organisation committee in July 2008, based on the recommendation of the chief executive officer, and the demonstration of exceptional performance by those included in the scheme.</P>
        <P>I understand that the HSE has advised the Minister for Health and Children that the performance-related awards made by the board in respect of 2007 for HSE senior management totals &euro;1.4 million.  The chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive is eligible, under his contract of employment, for an annual bonus of up to 25% of his basic salary.  In accordance <Col N="852"/>with normal governance arrangements, the board of the HSE is responsible for the operation of the CEO&rsquo;s bonus.  The Minister understands from the HSE that the award for the CEO is still under consideration by the board of the HSE.</P>
        <P>While the performance-related award scheme in the HSE is the responsibility of the board of the HSE, the Department of Health and Children has established a performance-related awards committee to provide oversight of the operation of the PRA schemes in the health sector.  This committee includes representatives on the wider public service and the private sector.  In its examination of performance-related awards, the committee has regard to key principles of the PRA schemes outlined by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector report; principles of best practice in the area of governance and accountability in the schemes; and quality assurance in the operation of the schemes.  This committee is a monitoring body and has no function in the authorisation of payment.</P>
        <P>The data on the awards made in the HSE in respect of 2007 have just been received by the Department of Health and Children and will be examined by the oversight committee in due course.  The HSE continues to drive a major transformation programme that will fundamentally change how health services are provided, while at the same time delivering and developing health and social care services to meet the increasing demands in terms of population growth and diversity of services required.  This must be achieved against a backdrop of a changing and challenging economic climate which ultimately impinges on the capacity of the health system to meet the escalating demands.  The HSE operates within an approved budget allocation and in line with the HSE national service plan.</P>
        <P>The target level of delivery set for the year in respect of hospital inpatient and day cases was 1.184 million cases.  All the indications to date are that this projected level of activity will be met and perhaps exceeded.  The activity level therefore is expected to at least match performance during 2007.</P>
        <P>The HSE is currently implementing proposals to ensure an overall balanced Vote outcome on expenditure while optimising patient services and continuing the reform agenda.</P>
        <P>Some of the cost savings in operational overheads being pursued and reported on as part of the monthly monitoring of the service plan include reduction in travel and subsistence, consultancy and advertising costs, as well as the cancellation of all non-essential training.</P>
        <P>The House may be assured that the board of the HSE is fully conscious of its obligations to manage expenditure prudently in challenging circumstances and within its allocated Vote.</P>

	<P>I want to share time with Deputy Deirdre Clune.  Let us hope, for all our sakes, that we get a slightly better answer than the House got to the previous question.  From that answer, one would swear the HSE was playing a blinder.  Is it living on the same planet? </P>
        <P>I am raising an issue that both Deputy Clune and I have brought up consistently, as indeed has the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for many years.  The neglect of Cork Airport by this Government is nothing short of a political scandal and a disgrace.  However, this is much more than political because it is hampering the development of Cork Airport, Cork and southern Munster as a region.  This is as a result of Cork Airport&rsquo;s inability to grow and plan aggressively and competitively against the airports it needs to compete with independently.  It <Col N="853"/>is farcical and dangerous that the board of Cork Airport has no chairman.  There has been no conclusive decisions in terms of how the new terminal will be paid for and who will carry the debt.  As a result, the board of the Cork Airport Authority, CAA, is not even meeting at the moment.</P>
        <P>The Minister said he would appoint a new chairman of the CAA board as a priority, but we have still heard nothing.  This is not an issue that will cost the Government any money.  It is not a budgetary matter, but it requires political priority and new good people to give leadership in Cork Airport to ensure it can develop in the ambitious manner that the people of Cork want.  I appeal to the Minister to make decisions and appointments and to let people in Cork know that the Government is going to stop treating it as a second class airport.</P>
        <P>We are expected to compete with Dublin Airport, yet the manager in Cork Airport is an employee of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA.  Every decision, even significant ones taken on a day to day basis at Cork Airport, need to be approved in Dublin.  The CAA has sent a business development plan to the DAA for approval.  This means that Cork&rsquo;s business competitor needs to approve its business plan.  Cork Airport operates with one arm tied behind its back and this is hampering development and investment in Cork.  It needs to stop, so please give us some clear answers this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister of State&rsquo;s response will not be littered with references, which we constantly hear on this side, to the effect that this is a matter for the Dublin Airport Authority.  It is not a matter for the Dublin Airport Authority but for the Minister for Transport, who is responsible for ensuring, as part of his remit that there is balanced regional development.  This means ensuring that Cork Airport is put on a sound footing so that it can move forward as it wants to, on an independent basis &mdash; leaving aside the debt issue which has not been resolved.  In 2004, the State Airports Act stated that the three airports, Shannon, Cork and Dublin, would be developed as three independent authorities.  That still has not happened and there is the farcical situation where the CAA has been left without a chairman since the former incumbent resigned from the board in April this year.  Any decision that has to be taken at Cork Airport, as Deputy Coveney has outlined, is referred to the DAA.  The e-mails and notepaper of the CAA&rsquo;s chief executive is headed &ldquo;Dublin Airport Authority&rdquo;.  That situation is absolutely ridiculous since the two airports are in competition.  Let Cork get on with it and make decisions for itself based on what is best for the airport and the region.  The Minister should appoint a chairman and let a business plan be adopted so that Cork may move forward and do the job it is supposed to do. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Coveney and Clune for raising this issue.  The State Airports Act 2004 provides the framework for the establishment of Shannon and Cork as independent airports.  As part of the airport restructuring process, the boards of Cork and Shannon Airports are required to prepare business plans for eventual separation.  All three airport business plans have to be co-ordinated by the Dublin Airport Authority for eventual approval by the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance. </P>
        <P>Among the requirements to be satisfied in advance of separation is the need to ensure the financial sustainability of all three State airports.  It has always been the Government&rsquo;s position that the resolution of the debt issue at Cork Airport would have to ensure that the debt burden Cork would undertake would be a manageable one for it and would form a reasonable basis for Cork Airport&rsquo;s autonomy, without in any way putting at risk its commercial future.  However, it is also the Government&rsquo;s position that the sharing of the Cork debt, much of which by the way was incurred in financing the new terminal and other infrastructural works at Cork Airport, to be borne by both the Cork and Dublin Airport Authorities will have to take account not only <Col N="854"/>of what is commercially and financially feasible for Cork Airport, but also for the Dublin Airport Authority.</P>
        <P>In order to break the logjam between the DAA and the CAA on the equity of the debt, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, appointed Mr. Peter Cassells to mediate between the two parties with a view to reaching an agreement acceptable to both.  Mr. Cassells&rsquo;s conclusions and recommendations were the outcome of that dialogue with both parties.  The recommendation is that the CAA takes responsibility for debt of &euro;113 million in return for the transfer of net assets of &euro;220 million on separation.  The board of the CAA has accepted this recommendation.  This is a positive step which will enable the finalisation of realistic business plans, taking account of the Cassells recommendations in the case of Cork.  The Minister has already received the Cork and Shannon business plans and he expects shortly to receive a finalised commentary on those plans by the DAA when it submits its own plan under the Act.  He would expect the DAA&rsquo;s commentary to address recent trends in the aviation market, the challenges facing the State airports and the financial and operational aspects of restructuring.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, Mr. Joe Gantly stepped down from his role as chairman of Cork Airport with effect from 1 August last and it is hoped to fill that vacancy in the near future.</P>

	<P>I want to share a minute of my time with Deputy Damien English, with the agreement of the House. </P>
        <P>I mean no disrespect to my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, but I am very disappointed that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not here.  Based on what I have heard previously in this House and what I expect to hear tonight, my view is that we are signing the death warrant for one of the most traditional practices Ireland has ever known, the cutting of turf on 32 raised bogs across the country, which will affect thousands of turf cutters.</P>
        <P>I received an answer to a D&aacute;il question recently from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and what he is up to is nothing short of astounding.  I will paraphrase it as quickly as I can.  He said he was conscious of the recent increases in energy costs, but the reason for the derogation was to allow domestic cutters a reasonable time to find alternative sources of fuel.  Peat was an honourable and noble source as well as a valuable habitat, which we were required to protect, but he said the derogation would expire at the end of this year.  Where does the Minister think we will get an alternative supply?  Where does the Minister of State think it is?</P>

	<P>The volume of every other form of fuel has increased tenfold but the Government is committed to kicking thousands off the bogs this year; turf cutters who have worked them for generations.  They cut turf for their own fuel supply and they will not be there this time next year.  The Minister of State is in the middle of this.  I am a turf cutter and I hope he will do everything humanly possible to secure another derogation for at least a few years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing time.  Will the Minister of State furnish us with the scientific evidence relating to the bogs selected under this scheme?  This has not been provided yet, despite our attempts to obtain it on numerous occasions.  That would help the turf cutters make a case for an extension of the scheme.  They were led to <Col N="855"/>believe there could be an extension to the ten-year rule but the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will not comment on that.</P>
        <P>What are the rules?  Information is seriously lacking.  The Department thinks that sending out a lump of paper in the post a few years ago was sufficient to inform people about the rules and the legalities of cutting turf.  Turf cutters are afraid because they are not sure what they can do.  Will the Minister of State clarify whether they need permission to cut turf?  This issue was discussed by the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government because of worries that the Minister intends to ram this change through and force people off the bogs.  Some of these people have spent their lives working on bogs and they have the scars to show for it.  They want a role in their local bogs but no management plans are in place and no discussion has taken place on how they can be involved in, for example, tourism projects.  Will it be possible for them to cut turf without using machines?</P>
        <P>Let us show consideration for families, generations of whom have worked on the bogs, and not introduce a blanket ban at the end of the derogation.  This is the reality for some people and this work is part of their lives and culture.  It is not as straightforward as shoving them off the bogs and the Minister telling the House this affects only 10% of all bogs in the State.  That is not an answer.  This ban is very serious for those working the 10% of bogs affected.  They are not being well looked after and it is assumed they can stop and that will be it.  That is not good enough.</P>
        <P>If people are expected to give up their right to cut turf, with others possibly benefiting through swapping arrangements and so on, the current compensation must be examined.  It is totally and utterly ridiculous, as it does not reflect the current cost of energy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for raising the issue.  I am taking the debate on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who asked me to confirm that he is fully aware of the concerns of Deputies and of traditional turf cutters who have relied on turf for domestic fuel.  He also recognises the concern about the costs of alternative fuel.  It is important to be clear about the position regarding the bogs in question.  I must declare an interest, as I have a bog plot.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This issue concerns a small fraction of the bogs of Ireland and it must be reiterated that turf cutting will continue on the vast majority of bogs.  Of the approximately 1,600 raised bogs, only 139 are designated for protection, with 32 of them subject to the ten-year derogation that lapses this year.  Ireland&rsquo;s raised bogs are priority habitat under the EU habitats directive.  The State has 60% of western Europe&rsquo;s remaining heritage of uncut raised bog.  However, less than 1% of the original area of active raised bogs, that is, peatland on which the indigenous flora are still growing and forming peat, remains.</P>
        <P>Ireland is required to protect priority habitats of European importance under the Habitats Directive, which was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 and the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.  Successive Governments have designated bog habitats for protection, nominating candidate special areas of conservation in 1999 and in 2002 and natural heritage areas in 2004.  When arrangements were announced for cessation of turf cutting in SACs in 1999, a ten-year grace period was granted to domestic turf cutters.  This was intended to allow them to find alternative sources of fuel.  This period is coming to an end on the 32 raised bogs in question.  A similar ten-year derogation applies to bogs designated after 1999.  For example, when NHAs were designated in 2004, under an agreement with the farming organisations, another ten-year derogation was put in place, allowing cutting in NHAs until 2014.  It is important to put this limited cessation of turf cutting into perspective and to acknowledge that turf cutting will continue in large areas of undesignated bog.</P><Col N="856"/>
        <P>With regard to meeting our obligations to protect this habitat, a recent review of the state of our bogs revealed severe and continuing damage.  In the ten years since commercial cutting was ended in designated areas, 35% of the remaining area of this priority EU habitat was lost through domestic cutting and we are losing between 2% and 4% of our remaining active raised bog per annum.  The overall scientific assessment of the state of this habitat is &ldquo;unfavourable, bad&rdquo;, which is the worst of three categories.  EU member states with such unfavourable status in a habitat are legally obliged to take measures to ensure improvement.  The Government&rsquo;s responsibility is to ensure Ireland fulfils its legal obligations and it would not be appropriate to extend the ten-year periods for the ending of cutting in the limited areas involved.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that the cessation of domestic cutting is encouraged by the purchase by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government of the traditional turf-cutting rights through a voluntary scheme in designated areas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the Minister for Education and Science is not present for the debate.  My concern relates to Holy Trinity national school in Leopardstown, which has 108 pupils.  A further 70 have been enrolled for September 2009, which is the equivalent of two junior infant classes.  The school has no permanent buildings and it operates out of five prefabs.  It has no play or PE facilities and it has no facilities for a resource teacher.  The cost of the prefabs to date, together with the basic works required to facilitate the operation of the school, is more than &euro;1 million.  The prefabs are rented at a cost of &euro;20,000 per classroom per year.  With each year that passes, &euro;100,000 is spent on the rental of such buildings.</P>
        <P>In 2006 the school board was promised a permanent school.  The architectural plans were submitted in final form in May 2008.  When I sought to ascertain by way of parliamentary question on 24 September 2008 whether the Minister would sanction the project moving forward, he replied, &ldquo;In light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of this project at this time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The population serviced by the school has increased by 35% in four years and it is expected to reach 41,000 by 2016.  There is an urgent need for the Minister to sanction the provision of permanent buildings for this school and there is no particular reason such sanction and construction cannot be fast-tracked.  Schools confronted by similar population growth in north Dublin were fast-tracked, granted planning permission and construction was sanctioned.  Will the Minister recognise the needs of this community and sanction the construction of these badly need buildings without further delay?</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Only ten days ago, the Minister announced plans for 25 new schools building projects and he indicated he would not sanction further projects in the primary sector until next spring.  This primary school needs to be constructed.  There is no reason the families and children living in Leopardstown should be subject to the discrimination they are clearly suffering.  No permanent classroom has been sanctioned in the primary sector in south Dublin for more than 15 years.  I ask the Minister to give this project the priority to which it is entitled in order that the school board can move forward from the architectural planning stage to make a formal planning application to D&uacute;n Laoighaire-Rathdown County Council and then to proceed to tender.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am asking that the funds for the construction of the school be made available and that it be fast-tracked for a particular reason, that the school will not be able to cope with pupil demand without either the construction of a permanent school building or additional prefabs being <Col N="857"/>obtained.  However, there is no space for further prefabs.  If they are acquired, they will impinge on the site designated for the construction of the permanent school building, adding to the difficulties of the project going ahead.  An alternative site for prefabs would need to be found while the construction took place.</P>
    
        <P>The State is wasting money on rental when it could be invested in the construction of the badly needed permanent school building.  It would benefit the children, the parents and the teachers and provide the children with the types of play area, physical education facility and resource teaching classroom that they need and that other schools have.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Shatter for raising this matter.  I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science.  This is an opportunity for me to outline to the D&aacute;il the Department&rsquo;s capital programme of works for 2008 and the current position with regard to Holy Trinity national school, Glencairn, Leopardstown, Dublin 18.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the modernisation and policy unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc., leading to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  A proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  The project for Holy Trinity national school has been assigned a priority rating in band one.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will probably be aware, almost &euro;600 million in public funding is being provided for school buildings this year.  This will enable the completion of work on 67 large-scale primary schools projects, which will deliver 7,000 additional permanent school places in new schools and 2,300 additional permanent school places in existing schools.  Construction work on 150 devolved projects under the permanent accommodation scheme will provide 8,000 additional places in existing primary schools.  In the post-primary sector, construction work will be completed on 19 large-scale projects, which will provide 2,400 permanent school places in four new schools and additional accommodation and refurbishment works in 15 schools that will benefit more than 7,000 pupils.  Sites will be purchased to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, particularly in rapidly developing areas, and new projects will be progressed through architectural planning and design stages.</P>
        <P>On 29 September, the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, announced a further tranche of projects to progress through the school building programme, including five primary and two post-primary projects to prepare to go to site before the end of 2008, 12 primary and three post-primary projects to proceed to tender with a view to going on site in the first half of 2009, and three primary schools to progress up to and including application for planning permission and preparation of tender documents with a view to the earliest possible date to site.  In 2008, construction is also due to start on the first bundle of PPP schools, while further ones will be offered to the market next year with a view to building work commencing in later years.</P>
        <P>This is a significant programme of work by any standards and, while there will continue to be a focus during the year on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also be delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  The emphasis, however, will be on new schools and extensions to provide additionality in rapidly developing areas.</P><Col N="858"/>
        <P>Holy Trinity national school, Glencairn, Leopardstown, Dublin 18 is a co-educational primary school.  The enrolment as at 30 September 2007 was 75 pupils.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Today it has 108 pupils.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I will check on that for the Deputy.  The school has a current staff of one principal, two mainstream assistants, one developing post, one permanent resource teacher, one permanent learning support teacher and one temporary language support teacher.</P>
        <P>In January 2005, the school authority submitted an application to the Department for large-scale capital funding for an extension project.  An assessment of the projected enrolment trends, demographic trends and the housing developments in the area has been carried out and has determined the long-term projected staffing for a 24-classroom school.  The building project is in the early stages of architectural planning and a revised stage two is currently being examined.  The building project is being considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Over the lifetime of the national development plan, the Government will provide funding of &euro;4.5 billion for school buildings.  This will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State and will enable the Department to ensure that school places are available where they are needed.  The investment will allow the Department to continue the school building programme, which commenced during the lifetime of the last NDP when well over &euro;2.6 billion was invested in school development, delivering over 7,800 projects.</P>

        <P>One of the measures decided upon was a requirement that all Departments, State Agencies and Local Authorities &mdash; other than Health and Education &mdash; will be required to reduce their payroll bill by 3% by the end of 2009 through all appropriate measures identified by local management in the light of local circumstances. It is anticipated that measures to be taken in this regard may include control of premium pay, management of vacancies, the organisation of work processes and the levels at which work is carried out, as well as control of numbers through recruitment and other measures.</P>
        <P>My Department will be working with the Department of Finance to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to achieve the savings required.</P>

	<P>The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within 46 designated RAPID areas nationally. It is a matter for individual lead Departments to report on their investments in RAPID areas.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that, in 2004, I introduced the RAPID Leverage Fund to provide financial support for small-scale projects in RAPID areas, which are endorsed by the RAPID Area Implementation Teams. Under this scheme, my Department provides an additional grant of up to 30% of the funds allocated under the Sports Capital Programme operated by my Colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism for projects in or serving RAPID areas. Indeed from 2008 the overall level of funding has been increased to 90% of the project cost. Under this arrangement, top-up funding of &euro;1,960,426 has been allocated to projects in or serving RAPID areas under the Sports Capital Programme 2008.  Funding of &euro;13m has been allocated since 2004.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005, funding is ring-fenced annually to support priority projects in RAPID areas.  Since 2007, 15% of the annual &euro;7.5million available under the RAPID Additionality Measure is allocated to sports and youth related activities.</P>
        <P>A further &euro;0.2 million of the Dormant Accounts was allocated under the 2006 and 2007 rounds of funding for equipment grants for youth groups with a particular focus on disadvantaged and marginal groups.  Details of beneficiaries to date are available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.pobail.ie.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund also operates in some RAPID areas and to date, over &euro;66m has been allocated in capital funding to support the development of a range of youth, community and sports facilities in the areas in which it operates.</P>

	<P>Details of the public bodies funded by, or within the ambit of, my Department are:</P>

    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Western Development Commission</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department also provides funding for the following North/South Implementation Bodies jointly with the Department of Culture Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An Foras Teanga &mdash; which is comprised of Foras na Gaeilge and Tha Boord o Ulst&egrave;r-Scotch</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />and Waterways Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, my Department provides funding to Pobal to centrally manage a number of programmes.</P>
        <P>For the sake of completeness, I should also mention that a number of local development agencies receive funding either directly through my Department or through Pobal for local delivery of community and rural development measures.  This number comprises a total of 94 local development bodies and 184 community development projects.    Arising from the cohesion process, which involves the merger of overlapping LEADER and Partnership groups, the number of local development bodies will ultimately be reduced from 94 to 54.</P>
        <P>Since my appointment as Minister in 2002, one new agency, Oifig Choimisin&eacute;ir na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la was established.  For completeness I should add that during this time Pobal was reconstituted from the former Area Development Management Limited and that the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Board was replaced by the Dormant Accounts Board.</P>
        <P>The Charities Bill, which I anticipate will go to Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the current D&aacute;il session, provides for the dissolution of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations &amp; Bequests for Ireland.  The Bill further proposes that a new Charities Regulatory Authority will take over the functions of the Commissioners, as well as assuming a broader regulatory role for charities operating in Ireland, so as to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud, thus enhancing public confidence in the charities sector.</P>
        <P>In accordance with recent decisions adopted by the North South Ministerial Council and in order to secure good practice and value for money, the functions and funding for Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge, in addition to the functions of Colmcille in Ireland and Northern Ireland, have now transferred to Foras na Gaeilge.</P>
        <P>I would also advise the Deputy that Foras na Gaeilge &mdash; an agency of the North South Language Body -, in order to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis, is currently engaged in a review of the funding provided to 19 Irish language organisations with a view to ensuring optimum value for money going forward.</P>
        <P>In the Budget for 2008, the Minister for Finance announced an efficiency review that required all Departments to review the scope for savings in a wide range of areas including the scope for the rationalisation of State Agencies.  This was taken further in July, when the Minister for Finance specifically asked for a further review of all State Agencies to examine whether they can share services, whether it would be appropriate to absorb some of their functions back into their parent Departments or whether some agencies should be amalgamated or abolished.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance is working with all Government Departments on this matter and issues arising from this are being considered in the context of the Budget for 2009.</P>

However, I chair the Inter-Departmental Group on Drugs (IDG), which meets quarterly and on which both the Department of Health &amp; Children and the Health Service Executive (HSE) are represented.

        <P>In this context, the Deputy should note that the HSE provide regular updates to the Group on a range of issues, including a progress report on matters relating to the Central Methadone Treatment List.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department operates a range of initiatives, schemes and programmes supportive of community groups and to upgrade facilities.  While these programmes do not specifically target improvements designed to reduce the carbon footprint of the facilities aided under these programmes, the improvements made to the facilities can serve to improve the <Col N="863"/>energy efficiency of the facilities concerned.  The key initiatives through which my Department provides support for improvements in community facilities are detailed below:</P>
        <P>Under the Programme of Support for Local Community and Voluntary Groups, grants are available for locally based groups who wish to undertake small scale refurbishment works or projects to upgrade equipment in use in community facilities.</P>
        <P>Under the new LEADER Programme, which will be delivered through Axes 3 &amp; 4 of the Rural Development Programme 2007-13, funding will be provided    for actions aimed at certain quality of life initiatives, specifically targeted to rural communities under the &lsquo;Basic Services for the Economy and Rural Population&rsquo; measure.  Although funding is not explicitly provided to ensure improvements in the carbon footprint values of community facilities, eligible activities under this measure does include the upgrading of general community and recreational infrastructure.   In accordance with the LEADER bottom-up approach, applications will be processed by Local Action Groups contracted to deliver the Programme on my Department&rsquo;s behalf.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the aim of the RAPID Programme is to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 46 designated RAPID areas.  In this regard, the RAPID leverage scheme supports small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas. I introduced a further enhancement to this scheme in September of this year, which should have a beneficial effect on the environment. Under the Physical Environment Improvement Scheme 2009-2013, initiatives on waste and environmental management may be supported.  Annual funding totalling &euro;9.2m will be provided for works under this scheme, &euro;4.6m from the RAPID leverage fund and &euro;4.6m from the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government through the relevant local authorities.</P>
        <P>Information including eligibility criteria regarding the above initiatives, schemes and programmes, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.pobail.ie.</P>
        <P>Finally, in regard to islands development, my Department is examining, in cooperation with Sustainable Energy Ireland, the feasibility of developing alternative energy systems on inhabited offshore islands.  As a first step, a design study is to be commissioned that will examine the potential of a wind powered low CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> system with minimum energy imports.  The study will investigate the potential cost savings for the consumer of an integrated system with respect to the current energy system.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to the ongoing development of supports to strengthen and underpin the work of the community and voluntary sector in Ireland.   Indeed, the growth of the sector in recent years has been accompanied by a significant expansion of supports by Government. My Department alone provides funding in excess of &euro;400m annually to the groups and measures across the sector.</P>
        <P>Policy initiatives are underpinned by the &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; Partnership Agreement, which recognises the valuable role of the community &amp; voluntary sector. The agreement notes that the great strength of voluntary activity is that it emerges organically from communities and points out that while the Government should not seek to control and be involved in every <Col N="864"/>aspect of voluntary activity, it does have a responsibility to provide an enabling framework to help the sector.</P>
        <P>A key area of support is in relation to Charities legislation. The Charities Bill, which I anticipate will go to Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the current session provides for a new Charities Regulatory Authority to be established, which will assume a broader regulatory role for charities operating in Ireland.  This will secure improved accountability and protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud, thus enhancing public confidence in the charities sector.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should also note that my Department provides funding to the community and voluntary sector for training in relation to capacity building in governance and compliance, strategic development, and service to communities. The Local Development Programme also provides training and education grants for community development capacity building, IT training, or any other training priorities identified by local voluntary groups.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Community Development Programme provides community premises, development workers and a capacity building project to disadvantaged communities in over 150 locations throughout the country. They play a significant role in building community infrastructure and enhancing the capacity of the voluntary groups within the communities.</P>
        <P>The Task Force on Active Citizenship recommended that my Department fund a network of volunteer centres across the country. The Department is now supporting twenty such centres, and they support, promote and coordinate voluntary activities around Ireland, for example the &lsquo;Give it a Swirl Day&rsquo; which recently took place in many locations to highlight local volunteering opportunities.</P>
        <P>Further details in relation to schemes and programmes operated by my Department that support the wider community &amp; voluntary sector are available on my Department&rsquo;s website &mdash; www.pobail.ie.</P>

	<P>Under the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, which targets 10-21 year olds at risk of drug misuse, a broad range of activities and initiatives are being supported.  As the Deputy is aware, the Fund has a strong prevention focus and its aim is to attract young people in disadvantaged areas into facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse.  Of the order of &euro;22m is being provided this year to support the valuable work being done through the Fund. Consistent with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement in May last, arrangements to transfer responsibility for the Fund to the Office of the Minister for Youth Affairs and Children are currently being progressed.</P>
        <P>In this context, it should also be noted that I recently announced funding of almost &euro;2.3m for the development of 16 dedicated youth facilities in Regional Drugs Task Force areas not covered by the YPFSF.  I am confident that these projects will play an important and ongoing role in diverting young people away from the dangers of drug use.</P>
        <P>A number of the projects being run through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces also work with under-18s.  The type of projects funded range from drugs education workers, prison links workers, counsellors, youth information projects and outreach services.  Some of the projects funded are not exclusively for under-18s &mdash; rather they encompass family members under family support projects and initiatives run by community drugs teams.</P>
        <P>This year, additional funding has been provided to the Drugs Task Forces to facilitate local and regional drugs awareness campaigns to dovetail with the national campaign, focusing on cocaine. These will be particularly relevant to young people as the Drugs Prevalence Survey 2006/07 confirmed that illegal drug usage is predominantly a younger adult phenomenon, particularly among the 15-34 year age group.</P>
        <P>In addition to the work of my own Department, as outlined above, there are, of course, a number of programmes and schemes being run by other Departments and Agencies which are aimed specifically at helping the under- 18&rsquo;s.  These include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Department of Education and Science are ensuring that drugs education programmes are being delivered to all schools as part of the wider social and personal health programmes delivered through SPHE, Walk Tall, and On Your Own Two Feet and the majority of schools now have substance misuse policies in place;</P><Col N="866"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have over 100 Special Projects in place around the country under their Juvenile Liaison service and the Garda Diversion Programmes.  These projects work with young people at risk of engaging in crime and substance misuse; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Primary responsibility for the treatment and rehabilitation of under-18s lies with the Health Service Executive who developed guidelines for the treatment of this age group in 2006.  I am assured that all under-18s are prioritised for treatment and that the HSE is working to implement the recommendations of the under-18s Working Group who developed the guidelines.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Finally, in relation to the new National Drugs Strategy, the Deputy will be aware that the work of the Steering Group, charged with developing proposals in this regard, is on-going at present. I am confident that the needs of particular groups, including the under-18s, will considered by them in their deliberations over the coming months.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 161 together.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s Statement on the Irish Language 2006 includes a commitment to develop a 20-year Strategy for the Irish language, which is intended to be the foundation for practical action for supporting and promoting the language, based on a modern, integrated approach.</P>
        <P>With regard to the consultation process for the formulation of the Strategy, my Department is currently in the second phase of the public consultation process. The first phase took place earlier this year and involved a series of public meetings and an on-line survey.  Based on the views and recommendations expressed by the public during this process, a discussion document has been published that draws together the various strands and has outlined the key elements to be addressed in the Strategy.  A further series of public meetings is currently being held to give people the opportunity to express their views regarding the discussion document.</P>
        <P>In addition to the public consultation, Fiontar DCU, the consultants that are assisting in the formulation of the Strategy, are in consultation with key stakeholders in both the public and voluntary sectors as to their recommendations for inclusion in the Strategy.  Fiontar have also brought together in their Advisory Group international expertise with experience in minority languages.</P>
        <P>The Strategy, when completed, will be a comprehensive road map of where we need to go, over the 20 year implementation timeframe.  Each individual element of the Strategy &mdash; Irish in the community, in the education system, provision of public services through Irish, and so on &mdash; will require to be fleshed out in detail in sectoral plans once the overall Strategy has Government approval.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the draft Strategy will be submitted for my consideration and for submission for Government approval by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>My Department does not operate a scheme or programme specifically for rural lighting.  However, funding may be available under a number of the Department&rsquo;s schemes as follows: Under the Gaeltacht and Islands Improvement Schemes, my Department may provide assistance to Local Authorities for co-funded village enhancement works, which may include public lighting. Under the Community Support for Older People (CSOP) scheme, grants are provided to support the installation of external lighting for qualifying older people, and to provide interior emergency lighting for qualifying older people living on our offshore islands.  This scheme is managed by my Department and is administered locally by community and voluntary groups.   Under the LEADER programme, which will be delivered through Axes 3 &amp; 4 of the Rural Development Programme 2007-13, support will be provided for actions aimed at enhancing the environmental, amenity and surface structural aspects of villages and small towns under the &lsquo;Village Renewal and Development&rsquo; measure. In this context, funding may be available for public utilities such as street lighting. </P><Col N="868"/>
        <P>I should point out that, in accordance with the LEADER bottom-up approach to rural development, applications for funding the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 are processed by Local Action Groups contracted to deliver the Programme on my Department&rsquo;s behalf.  My Department has no role in processing such applications.</P>

        <P>Tackling cocaine use and implementing the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation remain priorities for Government.  In this regard, funding of nearly &euro;1.2m is being made available to:</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />strengthen and develop existing cocaine-specific projects in LDTF areas; and</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">All of the projects being supported through this latest round of funding were identified by the Drugs Task Forces and were approved following a rigorous assessment process.</P>
        <P>In the main, the funding approved will support the employment of front-line project workers, counsellors and outreach workers who will provide specialist treatment and care to those affected by cocaine use and those in recovery from addiction.

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am aware of the recent seizure of crystal methamphetamine, historically in Ireland, there have been low levels of seizures in relation to that substance.  Indeed, despite its popularity in some central and eastern European countries, across the EU generally, the drug has never taken off in terms of demand.</P><Col N="869"/>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) -through its Early Warning and Emerging Trends Sub-Committee &mdash; continues to monitor the situation.  The NACD published a summary report on a pilot Drug Trend Monitoring System in 2007 which suggested a declining popularity for amphetamines and this was borne out by the findings in the 2006/07 National Drug Prevalence Survey.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that in 2007, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na held a conference on Methamphetamine entitled &ldquo;to establish a threat assessment for the increase in availability of methamphetamine within the European Union&rdquo;.   Arising from the conference, a detailed report was circulated to Regional and Local Drugs Task Forces.</P>
        <P>In terms of drug prevention, evidence suggests that drawing attention to a drug not commonly used can serve to incite interest and, therefore, the best approach is to work with drug task forces, state agencies and service providers to monitor the situation.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the National Addiction Training Institute has a training programme underway to enhance the skills of addiction teams and community drug workers in dealing with stimulant use.  This will be equally useful for those who engage with methamphetamine users.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation, published in May 2007, made a series of recommendations for the development of a comprehensive rehabilitation pillar under the National Drugs Strategy. As agreed by the Working Group, the HSE has the lead role in this area.</P>
        <P>With regard to the appointment of the Senior Rehabilitation Co-ordinator, I understand that following recent interviews for the post, a formal offer has been made by the HSE to the successful candidate and an appointment is expected in the near future.  Officials of my Department were consulted by the HSE in relation to the recruitment process for the post.</P>
        <P>In addition, I understand that the National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee is currently in the process of being put in place to dovetail with the appointment of the Senior Rehabilitation Co-ordinator, who will chair it.   My Department will be represented on that Committee.</P>
        <P>Overall progress on the implementation of the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation will continue to be monitored through the Inter-Departmental Group on Drugs, which I chair.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153, 333 and 335 together.</P><Col N="871"/>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the majority of expenditure allocated to community groups through my Department for drugs initiatives is channelled through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces. Projects are submitted through Drugs Task Forces to the National Drugs Strategy Team who make recommendations to myself, as Minister with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, on funding.</P>
        <P>Over 440 Local Drugs Task Force (LDTF) projects, including those under the Emerging Needs Fund, are receiving funding from my Department.  The 2008 allocation of &euro;22m for such projects shows an increase of 9.5% over the amount spent in 2007.  In the region of 170 of these projects focus on treatment and rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>Across the ten Regional Drugs Task Force (RDTF) areas, work is progressing on the implementation of their Action Plans with the level of expenditure expected to increase by over 40% this year. Expenditure in 2007 on the ten RDTF plans came to over &euro;7m and the increased provision in 2008 will allow for the full year cost of the approx. 155 community projects already in progress and this year sees the start of roughly another 40 projects.  In 2007, a total of 67 treatment and rehabilitation projects were approved for funding and this is expected to rise to around 90 in 2008.</P>
        <P>In addition, I recently announced funding of almost &euro;2m for around 30 projects aimed at supporting rehabilitation (&euro;750,000) and addressing cocaine use (&euro;1.2m approx). This follows a call for proposals earlier this year to Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces.  The rehabilitation projects will assist recovering drug users to regain their capacity for life so that they can reintegrate back into their families and communities and begin to lead more meaningful lives again.</P>
        <P>Under the Premises Initiative Fund, which addresses the accommodation needs of community drugs projects in Task Force areas, nearly &euro;4m has been approved in 2008 for 15 capital projects, a number of which focus on rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputies will appreciate that the funding in 2009 for drugs initiatives will be decided in the context of the next year&rsquo;s Estimates.</P>

<P FLI="0">http://www.pobail.ie/en/IrishLanguage/CistenaGaeilge/.</P>
        <P>The Departmental response, which accompanies the report, indicates that the report and its conclusions have been noted.  I should make the point that I have introduced significant changes in the focus of Ciste na Gaeilge since the period under review to ensure that it remains an effective mechanism for supporting current priorities in relation to support of the Irish language outside the Gaeltacht.  These changes in focus include support for initiatives to underpin the status of Irish as an EU official and working language and assistance for the work of the EU Institutions in that regard, including translation of EU terminology into Irish, support for the teaching of Irish at 3rd level overseas, placenames research bursaries and support for development of DVDs for children.</P><Col N="872"/>
        <P>I am confident that Ciste na Gaeilge will continue to have an important role in the future, particularly an important supporting role on the ground in Ireland, arising from the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language that is in preparation at present.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Initiatives to tackle substance misuse in the south east are co-ordinated by the South Eastern Regional Drugs Task Force (SERDTF) which covers the counties of Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary South and Waterford.</P>
        <P>The SERDTF co-ordinates a number of activities covering the areas of treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and research and, to date, approximately &euro;4m has been provided to implement the Task Force&rsquo;s strategic plans.</P>
        <P>In addition the Deputy should note that:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Both Carlow Town and Waterford City have received significant funding under the Young Peoples Facilities &amp; Services Fund (YPFSF).  To date, Waterford has received almost &euro;6m of which approx. &euro;2.5m is for capital developments while Carlow has received approx &euro;2.5m of which almost &euro;1.5m represents capital funding.  The Fund assists in the development of youth facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />I recently allocated just under &euro;1m to three projects in the SERDTF under the Regional Youth Initiative which provided capital funding for the development of youth facilities in RDTF areas not covered by the YPFSF. Two of these projects are located in Co. Tipperary and the third based in Dungarvan, Co. Waterford.  I am confident that these projects will play a meaningful and ongoing role in diverting young people away from the dangers of drug use.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In this context, it should also be noted that my predecessor, Minister of State Pat Carey T.D., announced the expansion of the Fund earlier this year &mdash; in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government &mdash; and Wexford Town was selected as one of the new towns to be covered by the Fund.  Consistent with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement in May this year, my Department is currently progressing an Order to transfer the functions and duties relating to the Young Peoples Facilities &amp; Services Fund (YPFSF) to the Office of the Minister for Youth Affairs and Children.</P>
        <P>The SERDTF has also benefited from my recent announcement regarding funding allocations under the Rehabilitation and Cocaine Initiative.  Funding has been allocated to Aislinn Adolescent Addiction Treatment Centre under the Cocaine Initiative and funding was also made available for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Training on a cross-Task Force basis.  The Cornmarket project, through the Wexford Area Partnership, has also received funding under the Rehabilitation Initiative.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy should note that projects in the SERDTF have also benefited from funding under the Premises Initiative which provides for the accommodation needs of community drugs projects.  The Cornmarket Project was awarded almost &euro;95,000 under this Initiative and Gorey CBDI was awarded over &euro;220,000.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, there are 14 Local Drugs Task Force (LDTF) areas &mdash; 12 are located in Dublin, one in Cork City and one in Bray, Co. Wicklow.</P>
        <P>There are almost 400 people employed &mdash; both full and part-time &mdash; in a wide range of projects across the 14 LDTFs.  These workers include addiction counsellors, outreach workers, project managers and co-ordinators, family support workers, education/prevention officers etc.  However, as poly-drug use is on the increase, these workers deal with a range of issues &mdash; including but not exclusively &mdash; issues related to cocaine misuse.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting, however, that under the Emerging Needs Fund, seven dedicated cocaine specific projects were approved for funding in 2005/06.  A further nine projects aimed at poly-drug/cocaine use are also being supported under that Fund.  Over &euro;1m is provided annually through the National Drugs Strategy to support these projects and I recently approved an additional &euro;300,000 to further develop and enhance four of these initiatives.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should also note that my Department provided funding for four pilot cocaine projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use, as well as a training initiative for frontline personnel to deal with cocaine issues.   In this regard, I recently approved almost &euro;150,000 for one of these projects &mdash; located in Tallaght &mdash; to further develop their response to cocaine.</P>
        <P>Finally, it should be noted that a further &euro;750,000 is being provided this year to address cocaine use in local communities across both Regional and Local Drugs Task Force areas.  The majority of this allocation will fund dedicated cocaine and poly-drug workers and 12 such <Col N="875"/>proposals were approved &mdash; seven of which are located in Local Drugs Task Force areas.  The funding will also provide for cross-Task Force cocaine training.</P>

	<P>Research by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) has showed that illegal drug use is a youth phenomenon in particular. It is important, therefore, to understand that many factors come into play when people decide to experiment with drugs.  The risk factors associated with problematic drug use have been researched by the NACD and include the following: </P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Early school leaving/poor educational attainment;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />History of unemployment;</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Poor mental health history;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Family conflict/breakdown;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />History of addiction;</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Involvement in crime;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Anti-social behaviour; and</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Social Networks (drug using peers or not).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As the Deputy will appreciate, the more these predisposing factors exist for an individual the greater the vulnerability to &mdash; and risk of &mdash; drug use. At the community and individual level, the evidence shows that prevention programmes should focus on targeting risk and developing protective factors. These help to reduce the likelihood of experimentation and focus on individual characteristics and family, educational, peer group and community factors.</P>
        <P>In particular, there is evidence to suggest that the following types of interventions can be effective provided they meet specific conditions:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Community-based programmes targeting geographical areas of socio/economic disadvantage;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Early intervention programmes for children displaying risk factors</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Family programmes &mdash; can delay or prevent drug misuse; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />LifeSkills Training has some prevention effects &mdash; but mainly in relation to legal substances and students who are not already at risk.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">International evidence suggests that prevention works at three levels through (i) the use of universal strategies at the general population level, (ii) selective strategies used at the community level and (iii) indicative strategies aimed at the individual.</P>
        <P>While the provision of sport and recreational facilities may have a role to play, they will not, in themselves, provide the solution to the misuse of illicit substances. Ultimately, I believe that it is only through addressing the risk factors through both the National Drugs Strategy &mdash; and the broader social inclusion agenda &mdash; that we can ultimately reduce the prevalence of problem drug use in our society.</P>

	<P>The Office of the Attorney General is responsible for the maintenance of the electronic Irish Statute Book (www.irishstatutebook.ie).  The eISB currently contains all <Col N="879"/>Acts passed in the years 1922 to 2008 up to and including Act Number 12 of 2008 and all Statutory Instruments made since 1922, up to and including SI No. 350 of 2005.  It also contains a link to pdf versions of Statutory Instruments that have been produced through the Electronic Statutory Instruments System which was introduced in 2007.   The Office of the Attorney General is currently engaged in a process to update the eISB to include Acts 13 to 17 of 2008 by the end of October and Statutory Instruments made in the period between mid 2005 and 2008 by early 2009.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission has the task of updating the Legislation Directory (formerly the Chronological Tables) which is also part of the eISB and currently covers the years 1922 to 2005.  The main purpose of the Directory is to document modifications made to primary legislation by subsequent legislation and it is therefore a very useful source of information on the current state of the law.  The Commission published a consultation document on the Directory in July of this year in order to provide a focus for public discussion on how the Directory can best serve its users in terms of content provision and accessibility.  The closing date for receipt of submissions to the Law Reform Commission is 23 October.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas website is another useful source of information on primary legislation and includes listings of all Acts passed by the Oireachtas since 1922 and all Bills introduced in the Oireachtas since 1997.</P>
        <P>In addition to these overarching websites, some Departments already provide legislative information relating to their areas of responsibility on their individual websites.  This approach increases the accessibility of legislation for citizens in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitments on Better Regulation.   In this context, I will be asking all Ministers to ensure that, in line with best practice, legislation for which they have responsibility is listed on their Departmental websites in a transparent and consistent manner.</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S is, with the Local Employment Services provided by Area-Based Partnerships, currently gearing up its Employment Services further to provide increased capacity for expected increased referrals from the Live Register.</P>

<P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />promoting access for mobile workers to construction jobs elsewhere in the EU;</P>

	<P>The website of the Government&rsquo;s climate change awareness campaign, www.change.ie., provides a carbon calculator which enables everyone to work out their own carbon footprint.  Using this tool, my Department has estimated that the carbon emissions arising in the course of my ministerial functions amounted to 34.71 tonnes in the year to 30 September 2008.  Of this, 12.63 tonnes related to air travel, and includes the air travel of my predecessor, from October 2007. <Col N="881"/> Air travel is fully offset under the Government&rsquo;s carbon offsetting scheme for official travel.  There is no equivalent figure for the previous year, as I did not take up the post until May 2008.</P>
        <P>On the same basis, my Department has calculated the following carbon emissions arising from the functions of the Ministers of State in the year to 30 September 2008: Minister of State (Labour Affairs): 24.86 tonnes, of which 8.72 tonnes arose from air travel and is therefore offset; Minister of State (Trade and Commerce): 32.03 tonnes, of which 12.11 tonnes arose from air travel and is therefore offset; Minister of State (Science, Technology and Innovation): 16.82 tonnes, of which 6.51 tonnes arose from air travel and is therefore offset. Dr. Jimmy Devins T.D. was appointed to the position of Minister for Science, Technology and Innovation on 13 May, 2008.

	<P>The Programme for Government commits the Government to maintaining the success of Social Partnership by working with the social partners to ensure the full implementation of the Towards 2016 agreement and ensuring that pay improvements for public sector workers continue to be linked to delivery and verification of agreed improvements in public services.</P>
        <P>Towards 2016 sets out a mechanism for the verification of progress at sectoral, organisational and grade level in the Public Service through the establishment of a Performance Verification Group for each of the sectors &mdash; health, education and local authority sectors, the Civil Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Defence Forces. Under the terms of Towards 2016, payment of each of the Public Service pay increases is dependent on verification of satisfactory achievement <Col N="882"/>in relation to co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, including co-operation with satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation set out in the agreement, maintenance of stable industrial relations and the absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the agreement.</P>
        <P>Through the performance verification process, it has been possible to establish that there has been co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, stable industrial relations have been broadly maintained, and there has been co-operation with satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation set out in the agreement.  There has been ample evidence of significant improvements in areas such as financial management, human resources management, regulatory reform, eGovernment initiatives, and customer service delivery.</P>
        <P>The new Transitional Agreement under Towards 2016 recognises that the Public Service must review continuously its systems, processes and procedures, to ensure that it is responsive and efficient and that it provides high quality, value for money services.  The commitments under Towards 2016 will continue to be progressed in this agreement along with additional commitments to be progressed in the Transitional Agreement.  The arrangements whereby the payment of increases is dependent on the verification of satisfactory achievement of modernisation commitments, including improvements in performance and productivity, will also continue in the new agreement.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I refer to the answer to Question No. 55 of 22 May 2008.</P>
        <P>Article 52(3) of the Directive prohibits payment service providers from preventing merchants applying a surcharge or offering a reduction for the use of a given payment instrument. This is to ensure that the costs of efficient and inefficient payment instruments are transparent. Otherwise, all consumers would bear the costs of inefficient payment instruments as merchants would pass on charges in the form of a generally higher price level. This Article does allow Member States to forbid or limit the right to request charges. However, this can only be done if two conditions are satisfied, namely, that such a measure is consistent with the need to encourage competition and promote use of efficient payment instruments.</P>
        <P>Following its earlier consultation on options for transposing the Directive, my Department has recently concluded a second consultation on the text of the draft transposing regulations.  My Department is considering whether to avail of the discretion in Article 52(3) having regard to submissions received.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy raises a number of distinct questions and, for ease of reference, I will address each separately.</P>
        <P>Firstly, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as regards the fiduciary taxes (i.e. taxes collected by a third party on behalf of the State) such as VAT, PAYE, etc, the person responsible for accounting for each such fiduciary tax is the person who has a statutory obligation to both deduct and remit same.  In this instance, the Revenue Commissioners, as employer has that obligation and has accounted for, and paid, the tax that should have been deducted under the PAYE system, together with interest and penalties.</P>
        <P>Secondly, the Deputy refers to matters pertaining in Government Departments and county councils as regards staff having the option to travel on visits directly from their home instead of travelling from their place of work. I am informed by my officials and by the Revenue Commissioners that the long standing practice in this regard is that where an office holder or employee, in the performance of the duties of his/her office or employment, begins an official  business journey directly from home or returns directly to home, then the expenses of travel and subsistence that may be reimbursed without deduction of tax are the lesser of those incurred on the journey between</P>
<P el="5">(a)  home and the temporary work location; or</P>
<P el="5">(b)  the normal place of work and the temporary work location.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">This position remains unchanged. Thirdly, I am assured by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners that she is satisfied that the investigations in her office established the full extent of taxable benefits, and that procedures have been put in place to prevent any recurrence.</P>
        <P>As regards my Department, all remuneration is subject to tax where appropriate, in the normal way through the PAYE system.</P>
        <P>In addition, I am informed by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue officials made presentations to the Heads of Finance of Government Departments and the Finance Officers of Local Authorities during this year with the specific view of reminding them of their tax compliance responsibilities and that a range of compliance checks will be carried out on such bodies in 2009.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Deputies final remark, it is important to point out that the Revenue staff affected by the BIK settlement worked in IT and Customs areas of the organisation. Furthermore, when Revenue staff visit businesses either in the private or public sectors to carry out an audit, they do so in accordance with the published Code of Practice for Revenue Auditors.  This Code recognises that mistakes happen and provides for a range of penalties depending on <Col N="885"/>the circumstances and the nature of the default.  Revenue as employer was treated in exactly the same manner as any other employer in similar circumstances.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under the terms of the Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 25) Order, 1993, SI No. 266 of 1993, a farmer who is not registered for VAT may claim a refund of VAT paid by him or her in relation to the construction, extension, alteration or reconstruction of farm buildings and structures, including farm roads, on lands owned or occupied by him or her, where the works in question are designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of the farming business.</P>
        <P>Forestry is an agricultural production activity for the purposes of VAT law.  Thus, VAT paid by a farmer in relation to the construction of a road into a forest, including VAT on the materials and hire of machinery used in the construction, may be reclaimed under the terms of that Refund Order.</P>

	<P>The website of the Government&rsquo;s climate change awareness campaign, www.change.ie, provides a carbon calculator which enables everyone to work out their own carbon footprint. Using this tool, my Department has estimated that the carbon emissions in respect of air travel arising in the course of the ministerial functions of the Minister for Finance, amounted to 5.5 tonnes in the year to 30 September 2008, which will be fully offset under the Government&rsquo;s carbon offsetting scheme for official travel. The figures for the previous year are of a similar level. The Department of Justice has advised that the figures in respect of official travel by car are not readily available.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works has advised that the carbon emissions arising from the functions of the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, in the year to 30 September 2008, were 9.34 tonnes of which 4.32 tonnes arose from air travel. The figures for the previous year were 13.26 tonnes of which 2.28 arose from air travel.</P>

	<P>Year-to-year increases in allocations would not normally be granted to allow for increments.

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested regarding the number of applicants who received tax refunds on maternity benefit payments in 2007 and their value cannot be provided. This is because the PAYE system does not identify the reason giving rise to a review of an individual&rsquo;s tax liability.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187, 188, 189 and 194 together.</P>
        <P>The tonnage tax scheme for shipping companies was provided for in the Finance Act 2002 and introduced in 2003 following the granting of State aid approval by the European Commission. In common with most other EU member states which operate Commission approved tonnage tax schemes, it is not a requirement of the Irish tonnage tax scheme that qualifying ships be registered under the national flag. Accordingly, the number of ships included under the tonnage tax regime would not necessarily correspond with the number of ships listed under the Irish Register of Shipping.</P>
        <P>While it is not a condition of the Irish tonnage tax scheme that ships be registered in Ireland, I would point out that a central requirement of the scheme is that seagoing commercial ships are operated under the strategic and commercial management of qualifying shipping companies located in Ireland. In this regard companies qualifying for tonnage tax are required to undertake key management functions in the State in relation to ships included under the scheme thereby providing a clear link between the operation of these ships and their management and control by Irish based companies.</P>

	<P>The new draft Agreement, if ratified, will cover a period of 21 months from 1 October 2008 to 30 June 2010 in the public service. The draft agreement provides for a pay pause of 11 months in the public service followed by increases as follows:</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that, since the Government decision of 20 September 2008 to increase the statutory limit for the Deposit Guarantee Scheme for banks and building societies from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 per depositor per institution, the Government has now put in place a guarantee arrangement to safeguard all deposits (retail, commercial, institutional and interbank), covered bonds, senior debt and dated subordinated debt (lower tier II), with the following banks: Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Life and Permanent, Irish Nationwide Building Society and the Educational Building Society and such specific subsidiaries as may be approved by Government following consultation with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>Legislation to provide statutory effect to this decision, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, was enacted by the Oireachtas on Thursday 2 October.</P>
        <P>For Irish deposits with Irish-based subsidiaries of foreign banks that are regulated by the Irish Financial Regulator, &euro;100,000 per depositor per institution will be guaranteed by the statutory Deposit Guarantee Scheme. This guarantee level will also apply to credit union savers.  Branches of foreign credit institutions authorised in the European Economic Area (EEA) and operating in Ireland are entitled to apply to benefit from the enhanced guarantee on a &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; basis.  My Department is currently preparing legislation to give statutory effect to this increase from the date of my announcement.</P>
        <P>My Department has been informed by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBSFAI) that the total value of deposits owned by Irish residents is approximately &euro;179 billion. This is an aggregate figure based on the Central Bank Monthly Statistics up to the end of August 2008.</P>
        <P>While the CBSFAI does not routinely collect disaggregated data on deposits owned by Irish residents, such as the value and number of personal accounts and business accounts in Irish banks, I have forwarded the Question to the CBFSAI, which will reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Plant and machinery used for the generation of energy from renewable sources already qualifies for capital allowances at the rate of 12&frac12; per annum over 8 years. Allowing farmers double capital allowances would be excessively generous and would inevitably lead to calls for similar concessions from other sectors.</P>
        <P>In addition I should point out that there are already tax incentives in operation which relate to renewable energy. Investments in companies engaged in renewable energy generation may qualify for the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) tax relief. Individual investors holding a BES equity investment in such companies for a minimum period of five years can benefit from tax relief, at their marginal rate, in respect of investments of up to &euro;150,000 per year.</P>

	<P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the review of Tax Relief for Pensions Provision carried out jointly by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance in 2005, the report of which was published in 2006 as part of Volume III of the Budget 2006 Review of Tax Schemes &mdash; Internal Reviews of Certain Tax Schemes.</P>
        <P>The main conclusions reached in the Review are set out in paragraph 15 of Part IV of the report and are appended to this reply.</P>
        <P>In an effort to address the issues raised in the conclusions, the Review put forward, in paragraph 16, a number of options for change.  Following consideration of these options, the then Minister for Finance and now Taoiseach, Mr Brian Cowen TD decided, in the interest of creating greater equity in the pensions tax relief system and to address the particular problems identified, to make a number of significant changes in relation to the tax regime for both pensions and Approved Retirement Funds in the 2006 Budget and Finance Act. The changes involved:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />closing off excessive tax relieved funding for pensions through the imposition of a maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes of &euro;5m, with punitive tax on amounts drawn down in pension benefits in excess of that sum;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />imposing a cumulative limit of 25% of this amount (&euro;1.25m) on the maximum tax-free lump sum that can be taken on retirement; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />restricting the capacity of individuals to use Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) as purely long-term tax-exempt vehicles by introducing the concept of an annual &ldquo;notional distribution&rdquo; from ARFs which is taxable at the ARF owner&rsquo;s marginal tax rate.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The combined impact of the above changes addressed, to a large degree, the concerns raised in the Review.</P>
        <P>The fact that employer contributions to occupational pension schemes are not included within the employee age-related percentage limits and the overall earnings cap on pension contributions, was identified as an anomaly in the Review and considered among the options for change (Option 1, paragraph 16.2). However, the Review identified difficulties with such a course of action and rather than change the treatment of employer contributions, it was considered that the imposition of the limit on the maximum allowable tax relieved pension fund would be as effective, without giving rise to the difficulties identified in the Review.</P>
        <P el="10">Appendix: Conclusions of Review of Tax Relief for Pensions Provision</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Current tax reliefs appear to be too generous in relation to individuals whose employers are in a position to make substantial tax deductible contributions to their schemes without any earnings cap or age related % limits applying, particularly in circumstances where the individuals themselves are in a position to influence the level of employer contributions.</P><Col N="892"/>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />While the rationale for granting tax relief on pension contributions is to ensure that individuals save for retirement, are not a burden on the state and can acquire a pension that takes some cognisance of their pre-retirement earning levels and lifestyle, the current regime which allows an individual to create a pension fund over a very short period with a closing value well within maximum benefit limits of c. &euro;100 million, to take 25% of that as a tax free lump sum and place the remaining 75% in a tax exempt ARF, must be a matter of concern.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The current regime of relief may be perceived to be inequitable in so far as more generous reliefs are available to those in occupational pension schemes (having regard to the absence of age-related % limits and an earnings cap on employer contributions) as compared with the self-employed using RACs or those relying on PRSAs.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The &ldquo;maximum benefits&rdquo; rule of a pension of two thirds final remuneration appears to be ineffective in the absence of an absolute cap on the &ldquo;salary&rdquo; to which the 2/3rds rule is applied.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The 3 year average rule for determining final remuneration may allow an increase in earnings in the run up to retirement to maximise the final remuneration figure on which maximum benefits are calculated.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The ability to take a tax free lump sum of 25% of the value of the accumulated pension fund may be too generous when the value of the funds is substantial.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The introduction of the ARF option in 1999, while meeting the goals of choice, control and flexibility, has (based on the available evidence to date) largely not been used to fund an income stream in retirement.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The introduction of the ARF option would seem to be encouraging certain individuals to build up very substantial pension funds with a view to placing the funds long-term in tax-exempt environment of the ARF.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The introduction of the ARF regime may have undermined the &ldquo;EET&rdquo; system of pension taxation insofar as an individual with sufficient independent means can benefit from exempt contributions to a pension fund, gross roll up in respect of the income and gains of the fund, exempt transfer to and further gross roll up in an ARF and limited, if any, taxation on transfer on death.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) which is the successor programme to the Equal Opportunities Child<Col N="894"/>care Programme (EOCP) which concluded at the end of 2007.  The NCIP has been allocated &euro;575 million over 5 years, and is designed to deliver 50,000 additional childcare places.  10,000 of these places are designated for the 3 to 4 year old age group. Capital grants to develop childcare facilities are available to childcare providers in both the private and community sector.</P>
        <P>Preliminary figures collated by Pobal, the agency which administers the Programme on behalf of my Department, indicate that at the end of September 2008, approximately 29,793 new pre-school places for 3 to 4 year olds will be created under the NCIP from capital funding committed to date.  These places are in addition to the almost 40,000 new childcare places that were delivered under the EOCP, of which a large number would be in the pre-school age cohort.  It should be noted that the places created under both the EOCP and NCIP represent the number of children availing of pre-school rather than the number of pre-school places.  This is because more than one child may avail of a childcare place due to the sessional and part-time nature of some childcare services.</P>
        <P>Based on the Central Statistics Office (CSO) 2006 census, the total number of 3 to 4 years in the country in 2008  is 121,126.  My Office does not at present have detailed figures on childcare provision where funding has not been availed of under the EOCP or NCIP and I am unable therefore to advise the Deputy of the percentage and number of children aged 3 to 4 years who are in pre-school.  I understand that officials in my Office are currently examining ways to collect broader data on pre-school service provision.</P>

Such an assessment would encompass more than health matters. In so far as the health matters are concerned, she has noted the suggestion in the context of the development of the health services generally.</P>

        <P>In terms of monitoring of additives in consumer foods and also baby food, the main body responsible is the Health Service Executive through the Public Analyst Laboratories in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  In addition the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Dairy Sciences Laboratory are responsible in respect of specific controls on infant formula and follow on formulae.</P>
        <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has overall responsibility for the enforcement of food legislation in Ireland. The FSAI have advised me that an annual sampling and analysis programme is developed with the laboratories and is carried out on a risk assessment based approach; however, given that  only a small number of additives are permitted in foods for infants and young children, and those which are permitted are considered to be extremely safe, the FSAI considers that such uses of additives do not need to be routinely included in the annual monitoring programme.</P>

My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, and I are conscious of the effect that the unavoidable and unforeseen delays in implementing Fair Deal are causing to some older people and their families.  To date, &euro;13 million has been allocated from the additional monies provided in Budget 2008 for the provision of 200 contract beds.  Approval has also been <Col N="899"/>given to the HSE to utilise a further &euro;12 million in meeting costs associated with nursing home subventions and existing contract beds.</P>
        <P>This brings to &euro;25 million the total funding redirected from the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and committed to nursing home supports in 2008.

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The existing subvention scheme is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Act 2007.  In order to qualify for a subvention, an individual must be:</P>
<P el="5">(a) <Miles com="ix" />sufficiently dependent to require maintenance in a nursing home, and</P>
<P el="5">(b) <Miles com="ix" />unable to pay any or part of the cost of maintenance in the home. In order to determine this, they must undergo a means assessment which takes account of their income and assets. </P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Under the Act, the maximum amount for basic subvention is &euro;300 per week.  The Act also provides for enhanced subvention to be paid.  However, there is no maximum amount set for enhanced subvention.  The amount paid is at the discretion of the HSE and will vary depending on the following criteria:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the assessed means of the applicant,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the cost of care in the individual case compared to the level of fees in the locality,</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the amount of basic subvention payable,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the amount of resources available for the scheme,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the need for the HSE to ensure that the available resources are distributed in a way that supports applicants as evenly as  possible across the country.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In 2007, expenditure by the HSE on nursing home subventions was almost &euro;205 million.  This year the Government has redirected an additional &euro;25 million from the overall allocation in respect of the Nursing Home Support Scheme &mdash; A Fair Deal &mdash; for the purpose of nursing home supports, including subvention.</P>
        <P>Finally the deputy has asked about the levels of enhanced subvention in each county.  Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised.  I am referring the Deputy&rsquo;s query to the HSE for direct reply.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 and 247 to 250, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, my Office has been working to finalise a new Bill which will ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.</P>
        <P>The purpose of ratifying the Hague Convention is to protect children in the process of adoption.  The Hague Convention emphasises the importance of regulatory systems in protecting the fundamental rights of children, and in preventing the abduction, the sale of, or traffic in children.  Ratification of the Hague Convention puts in place the equivalent of a contract between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction.  It is the intention that the proposed adoption legislation will ensure all intercountry adoptions meet standards of the Convention either through ratification of the Convention or through bilateral agreements which meet the standards of the Hague Convention.</P>
        <P>As part of the preparations for the likely passage and entry into force of the new legislative arrangements for adoption in Ireland, my Office has been advising the Department of Foreign Affairs on the potential implications of the legislation on existing arrangements and agreements for those countries which have not yet ratified the Hague Convention.  The Russian Federation is one of these countries.  We are working actively to assess the possibilities of entering into bilateral agreements with a small number of countries.  Priority is being given to those countries which Irish applicants have a traditionally adopted from, for the reasons outlined by the <Col N="904"/>deputies.  Every effort will be made to advance bilaterals where this is possible and acceptable to the countries of origin.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, I do not believe it would be acceptable that the Government delay ratification given that Ireland has been a signatory since 1993 and is one of the last remaining countries to ratify the Convention.  The Convention is, in my view, a vital reassurance to applicants and the children they adopt about standards and protections in the intercountry adoption system.  The sooner we can advance to full ratification, the better for all concerned.</P>
        <P>Where bilateral agreements have not been completed prior to commencement every effort will be made to manage cases that may arise acting in the best interests of the children involved.  Information on progress on the proposed Bill and the changes contained within it will be made available to applicants over the period prior to commencement to minimise the number of cases and to ensure the best possible management of such cases where they arise.</P>

	<P>On 1 September 2008 the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) announced the availability of CervicalCheck, the National Cervical Screening Programme.  The Programme provides free smear tests through primary care settings to the 1.1 million women living in Ireland aged between 25 and 60 years.  The NCSS is fully committed to providing a quality assured population based cervical screening programme which has the potential to reduce current mortality rates from cervical cancer among women in Ireland by 80%.</P>
        <P>The NCSS undertook a transparent procurement process under EU procurement guidelines to select a suitable cytology laboratory provider.  On 9 May the NCSS announced that it had selected Quest Diagnostics, a US based company, as the &lsquo;preferred bidder&rsquo; as a result of this process.  Quest Diagnostics met all the criteria set out under the procurement process.</P>
        <P>Quest Diagnostics is reporting on all CervicalCheck smear tests.  The contract has been  awarded for a two year term with an option to renew for a further two years.  Up to 300,000 smear tests will be processed per annum.  All GPs and smear takers who register with CervicalCheck are informed of the correct procedure for sending programme smears to Quest.</P>
        <P>As CervicalCheck is rolled out nationally, the NCSS has indicated that the need for opportunistic smears outside the organised screening programme should disappear over time.  Some Irish laboratories may be currently processing remaining backlogs of non-programme smears.</P>

	<P>I have had ongoing discussions with the Chairperson and CEO of the Health Service Executive (HSE) regarding its plans to introduce revised management structures at both national and regional level in order to improve the delivery of health and personal social services.  The overall result of these changes will be:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />better  integration of primary, community and hospital care for the benefit of patients and to optimise the efficient use of resources;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />more clinical involvement in the design and management of patient services;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />more local responsibility and authority within defined national parameters through the establishment of service delivery areas.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The proposed new regional structures will not be autonomous entities and will operate in line with the organisation&rsquo;s national strategic direction, standards, operational policies, budgets and employment controls.  An Implementation Team led by the HSE&rsquo;s National Director of Human Resources has been established to oversee the process.  While the number of service delivery areas, and their boundaries, has yet to be finalised, the clear intention is that area directors will have operational responsibility and authority to deliver all hospital and community care services, and personal and social services, in their specific geographical areas within their budgets and employment allocations.  It is envisaged that there will be a reduction in the number of posts at Director level when the restructuring is complete.</P><Col N="908"/>
        <P>This approach will strengthen and simplify area governance.  It will also ensure more efficient and responsive delivery of local services and facilitate more local responsibility, authority and decision making within defined national parameters.</P>

	<P>The development of services for the management and treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD) was considered by the Working Group on Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services which reported in 2001.  All aspects of the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and management of children suffering from ADD/ADHD were considered by the Working Group in the course of its deliberations.  In its report, the Group recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric services as the most effective means of providing the required service for children with ADD/ADHD.</P>
        <P>The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including services for children and adults with ADD/ADHD, was considered in the context of the work of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy.  The report of that group &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; <Col N="909"/>was published in January 2006 and contains wide-ranging recommendations for the further development of mental health services for both children and adults.  The Government has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of mental health services.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of the particular research referred to by the Deputy.  However I am satisfied that the evidence base is extremely robust for the use of medication in the management of  ADD/ADHD.  Many studies have demonstrated significant improvements arising from the use of medication in this disorder and, while the Department keeps under review any new research, single studies would be considered in the context of the overall evidence base for this or any other treatment.</P>
        <P>Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall vote.

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 265 together.</P>
        <P>Around 130 m tonne kilometres were carried by rail in 2007.  While the overall volume of freight carried has been declining Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has made some progress in recent years in maintaining the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, e.g. large volumes or trainloads over long distances.</P>
        <P>I understand Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has undertaken extensive engagement with industry, transporters and port authorities but has had genuine difficulty in identifying business opportunities that offer reasonable volumes of business on a regular basis.  Rail freight generally involves road movements at each end of the logistics chain and given the often short distances in Ireland, it is difficult to develop a business case.  Only around 10% of freight movements in Ireland are in excess of 150 km.  The experience across Europe is no different.  Rail freight activities are most economic over long distances with large volumes and where the freight to be carried is not time sensitive.</P>
        <P>In relation to measures to encourage rail freight there is substantial ongoing current and capital Exchequer investment being made in the development and operation of the railway network.  Total Exchequer funding allocated to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for 2008 amounts to more than &euro;720 million.  In addition, rail freight has been fully liberalised since 1st January, 2007, and while no serious representations have been made to date to my Department by private rail operators for entry to the market, I would welcome any expressions of interest.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently preparing a Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan and freight issues, including rail freight, will feature in that plan.</P>

	<P>Port company board appointments are made in accordance with Section 30 of the Harbours Act 1996.  In advance of such appointments Section 30(7) of the Harbours Act 1996 provides that nominations are sought from relevant organisations.  Such recommendations are considered when making appointments.  However, appointments remain at the discretion of the Minister.</P>
        <P>In the case of the six vacancies on the board of Shannon Foynes Port Company eight nominations were received as part of the statutory consultation.  On 25 September 2008, six directors were appointed to the board of Shannon Foynes Port Company, including a new chairperson.</P>
        <P>I believe these appointments provide the board with an appropriate balance of skills, competencies and experience to enable the board to provide renewed leadership and strategic direction to the company.</P><Col N="912"/>
        <P>The last few years have been difficult for the company.  In 2006 and 2007, the company was party to a number of related legal disputes.  In October 2007, an out of court settlement was reached between the parties.</P>
        <P>Following the settlement, my Department considered the financial position of the company and has further reviewed the accounts for 2007 in the context of the 2008 AGM.  Minister Dempsey also met with the former chairman of the company on 3 March 2008.</P>
        <P>This has provided some reassurance that the company is addressing its financial difficulties, while continuing to operate and develop the business.  My Department will continue to closely monitor the financial situation of the company in accordance with normal corporate governance practice.</P>

        <P>All three airport business plans have to be co-ordinated by the Dublin Airport Authority for eventual approval by the Minister for Finance and myself.  Among the requirements to be satisfied in advance of separation is the need to ensure the financial sustainability of all three state airports.

	<P>The Irish Maritime Development Office published mid-year analysis of traffic through ports in the State that showed a reduction in the volume of cargo during the first half of 2008.  The data indicated a fall in container traffic volume compared to the same six months of 2007, with lift on/lift off traffic declining by 4% and roll on/roll off traffic declining by 3%.</P><Col N="914"/>
        <P>The changed economic climate has impacted on traffic volumes.  In 2007, throughput continued to grow but at a lower rate than previous years, with overall tonnage up 1.5%.  There was a marked slowdown in the latter part of 2007 and this has continued into the first half of 2008.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the changed economic circumstances, the provision of additional modern port capacity is still required in the medium term.  I believe that the historic trend toward increased international trade will continue, once the economy returns to growth.  It will be important that the transport infrastructure is in place to facilitate this trade.</P>
        <P>Since the Fisher Seaport Capacity study was completed in 2006, a number of ports have made significant progress in advancing their development proposals.</P>

	<P>The Irish immigration system facilitates migration to the State having regard to a number of factors including the economic and social needs of the State and its residents.  Where a need is identified the immigration authorities can, and do, respond to facilitate such migration in an orderly and proper manner and in conformity with normal immigration controls. </P>
        <P>I am aware that volunteers with the organisation to which the Deputy refers have traditionally been facilitated within this framework.  Where a permission is granted to persons who are undertaking voluntary work it is done so on the basis that they or the organisation concerned have sufficient funds to maintain the volunteer while in the State without recourse to State funds.  I understand that volunteers with the organisation referred to have been given permission to come to Ireland to work under those conditions.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008, I should point out that the Bill provides a statutory framework which will support the immigration policies of the State as may be settled from time to time.  Immigration policy is kept under constant review and, where a need is identified, amended and updated accordingly. In this regard, I can inform the Deputy that while immigration policy in relation to volunteer work remains under review, I have no proposals at this time to amend policy in this area.</P>

	<P>The Garda authorities have been examining the introduction of CCTV in public areas of Garda stations and have implemented a pilot project in Pearse Street and Store Street Stations.  This system has now been extended to the Bridewell station in Dublin and is currently being installed in Letterkenny station.  Plans are also well advanced for implementation in Monaghan station and, subject to the availability of resources, the Garda authorities intend to extend the system to include all custody holding facilities. </P>
        <P>The provisions of the electronic recording of suspect interviews have proven to be a very important safeguard for both detained persons and Garda&iacute; alike.  The latest figures available from the Garda authorities indicate that over 99% of all interviews as specified in the Regulations are being electronically recorded.  My Department is currently looking at possible changes to the Regulations in the light of recent legislative changes and in the context of the Morris Tribunal recommendations.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department on 18 February 2005.  On examination of that application it was determined that the person concerned did not satisfy the statutory residency requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  A letter informing the applicant of this was issued on 10 January 2006 and the applicant was also invited to lodge a new application. </P>

A letter informing the applicant of this was issued on 23 April 2008 and the applicant was once again invited to make a new application under his existing reference number.

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 5 September 2002 and subsequently claimed asylum.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. </P>
        <P>The person concerned was informed by letter dated 19 November 2004 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), namely to <Col N="923"/>leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e why she should not be deported.</P>
        <P>Her case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to all representations submitted on her behalf for permission to remain in the State.  On 4 May 2005 the then Minister refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her.  Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB),13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday 7 June 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State.  She presented as required and was given further presentation dates which she kept.  On 6 July 2005, she was removed from the State and returned to Nigeria.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might wish to note that, in addition to the 11 factors contained in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), I must, as stated earlier, also have regard for Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement before making a deportation order.  This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), in evaluating the safety of making returns to Nigeria and other third countries.  In this case, I am entirely satisfied that there were no refoulement related reasons to prevent the deportation of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>Further, I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and subsequently for temporary leave to remain in the State were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her was justified.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned, having been removed by the State, must remain out of the State.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 303 and 304 together.</P>
        <P>In order to provide some background information I can inform the Deputy that the Digital Mapping Project in the Property Registration Authority (PRA) commenced in July 2005 and is due for completion in 2010.  The system has been delivering considerable benefits to the entire country since the completion of Phase 1 in April 2006.  On that date Phase 2 of the project (the digitisation of some 15 million individual registered boundaries) commenced on a county by county basis.  Thirteen counties are now fully live on the system, with County Cavan due to be completed before the end of this month.  A progress map and regular progress reports are published on the PRA website which was last updated on the 9 September, 2008.  I understand that the project is on schedule and is being progressed in accordance with the timescales agreed with the contracting parties.</P>
        <P>I am informed that digitisation of boundaries is currently underway in three additional counties &mdash; Limerick, Cork and Mayo and that the scheduling of counties is influenced by a range of factors the most significant of which is the date at which Ordnance Survey Ireland are in a position to deliver the latest version of their digitised base maps.  The registered boundaries are then plotted and quality assured before being loaded on to the PRA&rsquo;s computerised system and declared live.  The digitisation of boundaries in respect of County Mayo has just started <Col N="925"/>(on 15 September, 2008) and is due for completion in May 2009.  When the process is about to commence for each county a briefing session is organised for solicitors and other users in the area and this was done in respect of County Mayo some months ago.  At that meeting the time schedules were outlined, demonstrations were given and practical information on how to best use the new system was provided.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that approximately 65% of dealings lodged in respect of County Mayo with the PRA do not require to be mapped and are not affected by the Digital Mapping Project at all.  I can also advise that at the end of September 2008, there were in the region of 9,000 applications for County Mayo awaiting mapping.  Virtually all of these cases had been lodged before the commencement of the project for the county.</P>
        <P>In addition to the improvements in customer service for map related applications and the new additional services that have been provided, the productivity gains from the project are very positive to date.  The business case for the introduction of digital mapping projected a 40% increase in productivity.  I understand that the project is still developing and, even though the staff of the PRA and its customers are at this point still becoming familiar with the new environment, this increase has already been achieved.</P>

        <Quest> the plans he has to cut funding in respect of returning &eacute;migr&eacute;s; and if he will honour the pledge made in August 2002 to provide assistance to agencies working with elderly and vulnerable Irish emigrants, or if it is planned to ignore the financial contribution which the Irish immigrant community has made over the years here. </Quest>

	<P>The Government is deeply conscious of the extraordinary contribution made by Irish immigrant communities to Ireland over many years.  Our commitment to assisting agencies working with these communities is reflected in the unprecedented level of funding secured for emigrant services in recent years.  This substantial increase has enabled my Department to provide greater financial support to organisations engaged in the delivery of key welfare, information and advisory services to our emigrant communities, and in particular the elderly and vulnerable. </P>
        <P>In this context, my Department has provided funding to two organisations working specifically with elderly Irish emigrants considering returning to Ireland &mdash; the Safe Home Programme and the Crosscare Migrant Project.  The award of a &euro;249,900 grant in April of this year brought the Department&rsquo;s total funding for Safe Home since 2005 to over &euro;900,000.  I have also approved funding of &euro;159,000 this year to support the Crosscare Migrant Project, bringing the total Emigrant Support funding awarded to the organisation since 2005 to &euro;475,000.  This substantial funding is testament to the high value which the Government places on their work.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to supporting frontline welfare agencies and organisations.  As the Deputy will appreciate, however, all grant applications for Emigrant Support funding are reviewed on their respective merits each year.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government have progressively and substantially increased the level of funding available for emigrant services in recent years.  These increases have enabled the Emigrant Support Programme, administered by the Irish Abroad Unit of my Department, to provide greater financial support to frontline welfare organisations which assist the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities, including the Safe Home Programme. </P>
        <P>My Department continues to be very supportive of the work undertaken by the Safe Home Programme.  The award of a &euro;249,900 grant in April of this year brought the Department&rsquo;s total funding to the organisation since 2003 to over &euro;1,100,000.  In 2007, additional Government funding, totalling &euro;72,000, was also awarded to the Safe Home Programme by the Department of Environment and Local Government and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  This substantial funding is testament to the high value which the Government places on the work performed by the organisation in enabling elderly Irish emigrants to return to live in Ireland.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In summer 2002, the Government of Israel decided to erect a physical barrier between Israel and Palestinian communities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, with the stated purpose of preventing Palestinian suicide bombers from entering Israel.  In an advisory opinion of 9 July 2004, the International Court of Justice found that the construction of the wall by Israel, the occupying power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), was contrary to international law.  The Court found that Israel was under an obligation to cease construction of the wall in the OPT, to dismantle the structure already erected, and to repeal all legislative and regulatory acts related to the construction.  Furthermore, Israel was required to make reparations for all damage caused by the construction, and other States were found to be under an obligation not to recognise the wall or assist in its maintenance. </P>
        <P>In its resolution ES-10/15 of 2 August 2004, the UN General Assembly, inter alia, demanded Israeli compliance with the ICJ advisory opinion, called upon all UN Member States to comply with their legal obligations, and requested the UN Secretary General to establish a register of damage caused.  On 24 January 2007, the UN General Assembly voted to establish the UN Register of Damage caused by the Wall in the Occupied Territories (UNRoD).  It will serve as a record of the material damage caused as a result of the construction of the wall but will not be a basis for dealing with claims for compensation.</P>
        <P>The Israeli Government has clearly failed to comply with the advisory opinion of the ICJ, or with UN General Assembly Resolution ES-10/15. As of May 2008, 409 kilometres of the wall (57 per cent of the planned route) had been built, 66 kilometres (9 per cent) were under construction, and construction of the remaining 248 kilometres (34 per cent) had yet to begin.  The wall has introduced new restrictions on movement for Palestinians living near its route , in addition to pre-existing restrictions.  It has a major impact on Palestinian villages, towns and cities, isolating communities and separating tens of thousands of people from services, lands and livelihoods.</P>
        <P>I raised Ireland&rsquo;s strong concerns about the wall directly with Israeli Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni, during my meeting with her in July, emphasising the hardship that its presence is causing in the lives of ordinary Palestinians.</P>
        <P>Ireland and its EU partners have consistently urged the Israeli Government to cease all activities in the Occupied Territories, including settlement building, the construction of the wall on occupied land and the demolition of Palestinian homes, which are contrary to international law and which threaten to make any solution based on the co-existence of two viable States physically impossible. In this regard, in my recent speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, I said that an end to the construction of illegal settlements would send a strong and welcome sign of good faith at a difficult and uncertain time, and I strongly urged Israel to listen to the concerned voice of the international community.</P>

        <P>Using the carbon calculator on the Government&rsquo;s climate change awareness website, www.change.ie , the carbon emissions arising for my official travel, for the period May 2008 to date, have been calculated as 12.55 tonnes.

        <P>In relation to my colleague, the Minister of State for Overseas Development, Mr. Peter Power T.D., the carbon emissions for the period of time which he has been in his current office, i.e. May 2008 to date, have been calculated as 11.45 tonnes.  No comparable figure is available for the previous year.</P>
        <P>For my colleague, the Minister of State for European Affairs, Mr Dick Roche T.D., the carbon emissions have been calculated as 16.72 tonnes per annum, from 1 October 2007 to date.

This substantial funding is testament to the high value which the Government places on their work.  The Government remains committed to supporting frontline welfare agencies and organisations.</P>
        <P>In addition, our network of Missions overseas are happy to advise Irish citizens who contact them seeking information on returning to live in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As regards the involvement of authorities in other countries, while they would not usually have a direct role in the process, we would of course seek their assistance if it was needed in a particular case.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 312 and 313 together. </P>
        <P>The Government remains seriously concerned about the humanitarian and security situation in Gaza, where the population of 1.5 million have been facing unsustainable conditions of daily life.  Aid dependency is now at an all-time high.  We have consistently called for an end to the isolation of the people of Gaza, in particular through the re-opening of crossing points for people and goods.  In my recent speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, I stated my strong view that improving conditions on the ground in the Palestinian Territories would make a significant and critical contribution to creating the right context for talks between Israel and the Palestinians to succeed.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue to work with EU partners to ensure that our concerns about these matters are conveyed to the Israeli Government at every appropriate opportunity.  I also conveyed the Government&rsquo;s concerns directly to Foreign Minister Livni during my visit to Israel on 9-10 July 2008.  I emphasised the importance of full implementation of the Roadmap for Peace in the Middle East, including the lifting of restrictions on access and movement, and an immediate freeze of Israeli settlements.  I argued strongly that Israel has to provide the Palestinian people with evidence that the political process works and can lead to an improvement in their daily lives, and stressed that we regarded the isolation of Gaza as politically counterproductive and unjust.</P>
        <P>The Government warmly welcomes the continuing ceasefire in Gaza, in force since 19 June, as well as the improvement in the security situation in the West Bank.  We hope that measures taken to date will contribute to an end to all violence in and from the Occupied Territories, and facilitate the urgent reopening of crossing points for people and goods and a lifting of restrictions on the movement of Palestinians, both in Gaza and the West Bank.</P>
        <P>In line with EU policy, we continue to have no contact with Hamas.  However, the Government believes that there can be no overall political settlement which does not include Gaza, and that Hamas will inevitably have to be brought into the process.  In this regard, it would be particularly helpful if Hamas took steps to build confidence in its intentions.  Furthermore, we strongly support ongoing efforts by Egypt, on behalf of the Arab League, to work with all parties to bring about Palestinian reconciliation.  If these efforts succeed, it will be necessary for the international community to review its policy towards Hamas.</P>

	<P>Neither I, nor any of the agencies under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, have responsibility in relation to the car rental industry or the level of tolls on the M50.</P>
        <P>As I understand it, the Deputy is concerned with increased charges arising from the introduction of barrier-free tolling on the M50 motorway and, in particular, the introduction by a car rental company of a handling fee per toll incurred by those renting cars.  This proposed charge, which I understand has yet to be levied on any customer by the company referred to in the correspondence provided by the Deputy, applies to tourists and non-tourists alike.</P>
        <P>In regard to additional individual handling charges introduced by commercial car rental companies, my advice when renting a car, in this highly competitive market, is to shop around among the many car rental companies available to obtain the best value possible and, in making their rental choice, take into account all charges levied by individual operators.</P>

	<P>Making use of the website of the Government&rsquo;s climate change awareness campaign,<i> www.change.ie</i>, to work out the carbon footprint, the Department has estimated that since I was appointed in May 2008 the carbon emissions arising in the course of my ministerial functions amounted to approximately 21.27 tonnes.  Of this, 5.17 tonnes related to air travel, which is fully offset under the Government&rsquo;s carbon offsetting scheme for official travel.  There is no equivalent figure for the previous year since I was only appointed in May 2008.  </P>
        <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, Martin Mansergh, TD, has no permanent facilities at the Department.  Accordingly, information in respect of carbon emissions arising from his ministerial functions would be provided in the reply from the Minister of Finance.</P>

	<P>Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme there are four principal stages in a swimming pool project which are: Feasibility Study/Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  Local authorities may not proceed to the next stage of a project until prior approval issues from my Department.  Grant aid is formally allocated only when the tender is approved.  The Department&rsquo;s technical advisers, the Office of Public Works (OPW), evaluates each stage. </P>
        <P>My Department approved the Contract Documents for the Ferrybank, Wexford Swimming Pool Project in November 2007, allowing Wexford Borough Council to prepare tender documentation.  The Council submitted tender documentation on 29 September 2008.  The tender <Col N="931"/>documentation is currently being evaluated by the OPW, which acts as technical adviser to the Department, and will then be considered by my Department.</P>
        <P>The Value for Money and Policy Review Report of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which was published recently, was carried out by the Department to examine, among other things, how the Programme has worked to date, and what changes, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.

	<P>This year saw record levels of Exchequer current investment for Tourism services &mdash; a total of almost &euro;153 million.  Within this, an amount of &euro;50 million was provided for overseas marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination, the highest ever amount provided for such purposes and an increase of 11% on the 2007 provision. </P>
        <P>Next year&rsquo;s budgets for tourism will be decided in the context of the Estimates process which, as the Deputy is aware, is ongoing. Obviously we are in a particularly challenging economic situation at present and in allocating resources, the Government must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society.  In this regard, I am aware that this is also a challenging time for the tourism industry and I am committed to seeking the optimum funding, including funding for international tourism marketing, within a framework of sound public finances and value for money to help ensure that the impressive tourism performance in recent years is maintained in the years ahead.  In terms of prioritising the overseas markets to focus on and the breakdown of spend between these markets, these will of course be primarily matters for the tourism agencies to determine.</P>

	<P>Letters have issued to each of this year&rsquo;s unsuccessful applicants, including the one in question, setting out the reasons why they were not awarded a grant. As that letter pointed out, given the level of demand for funding and the amount of funding available under the Programme, it is not possible for my Department to allocate grants to every applicant.  In this instance, the club did not meet a number of the qualifying conditions of the Programme in that the proof of title and the evidence of own funding provided was not sufficient.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the website of the Government&rsquo;s climate change awareness campaign, www.change.ie, provides a carbon calculator which enables everyone to work out their own carbon footprint.</P>
        <P>Using this tool, my Department has estimated that the carbon footprint arising in the context of my ministerial functions amounted to 7.04 tonnes in respect of air travel in the year to 13 June 2008, of which 4.81 tonnes will be offset under the Government&rsquo;s carbon offsetting scheme for official travel. The carbon footprint in respect of air travel for the period 14 June 2008 to 30 September 2008 amounted to 2.77 tonnes, all of which will be fully offset under the Government&rsquo;s carbon offsetting scheme for official travel.</P>
        <P>Due to the timeframe involved, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the carbon footprint in respect of use by me of the official ministerial car but the relevant information will be sent to the Deputy when the mileage details have been received from the Department of Justice, Equality and law Reform.</P>
        <P>On the same basis, my Department has calculated the following carbon emissions arising from the functions of the Ministers of State at my Department with special responsibility for Drugs Strategy and Community Affairs in the period 14 June 2007 to 30 September 2008:</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the overall funding of &euro;425m that will be available under the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme is almost three times the funding available under the last LEADER Programmes. In addition, the rates of aid and maximum levels of funding available are significantly increased, in particular for non-commercial community projects.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the provisions of the Programme restricting co-funding with other public bodies. Notwithstanding the significantly increased funding and rates of aid available, I am in favour of facilitating co-funding with certain other public bodies in particular circumstances, however, this will require a change to the Rural Development Programme. As this is an EU co-funded programme requests for changes must follow a particular protocol and my Department is currently in the process of preparing a submission to the European Commission in this context. I will report the outcome of this process as soon as it is complete.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Community Services Programme (CSP) is managed and funded by my Department.  As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of the Programme is to support voluntary and community groups in the wider community to provide essential services and employment opportunities with an emphasis on the alleviation of disadvantage.  Currently, some 350 projects are in contract to provide services under the Programme and ranging across a wide variety of activities.</P>
        <P>In March of this year, I launched the 2008 call for proposals to be submitted by the end of June.  The published criteria set out very clearly the processes and timetable that would be used to offer contracts to successful applicants for the delivery of services funded by the Programme.  Some 254 applications and expressions of interest were received: 100 applications were in respect of community halls and facilities; 95 in respect of community services and 59 for community enterprise.  Applications received by the end of June were acknowledged during July and an initial appraisal of the each application was undertaken during August and September to ensure eligibility and completeness of documentation.</P>
        <P>In line with the published timetable, I expect that recommendations in respect of the community halls and facilities strand will be submitted to me for decision later this month and <Col N="937"/>successful applicants can expect to receive notification of the result of their application by the end of November 2008.</P>
        <P>With regard to the other two strands, appraisal of expressions of interest will be completed before the end of November or early December.  I expect to be in a position to make decision on these by the end of January at the latest.  Applicants who are successful under the call for expressions of interest will then be considered further in the light of the financial measures available to the Department in 2009.</P>

        <P>On the 30th of April 2007 I announced details of a night-time rural transport scheme to be run on a pilot basis, in 7 areas around the country.</P>
        <P>The 34 groups currently delivering the Rural Transport Programme operated by the Department of Transport, were invited to submit applications. Following the appraisal of the proposals submitted, seven groups were selected to run the pilot Scheme, namely:</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Laois Trip.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Rural Transport Night Scheme, however, does not operate in County Kildare. It is my intention that the pilot scheme will be reviewed towards the end of 2008 and decisions in relation to its future will be informed by the outcome of the evaluation.</P>
        <P>In addition the Rural Social Scheme (RSS), which has become a key part of many rural communities throughout Ireland provides resources to maintain and improve local amenities and to generate important social inclusion benefits to community members such as supporting rural transport schemes.  The following list indicates the number and location of such transport services in 2007.</P>

	<P>The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within 46 designated RAPID areas nationally.  As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report progress under the RAPID programme.</P>
        <P>I initiated the RAPID leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.  These schemes are subject to ongoing review to ensure that they remain responsive to the demands of the RAPID communities.  Where opportunities arise, the eligibility of individual schemes can be extended to reflect emerging needs identified by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.</P>
        <P>To date in 2008 the following amounts have been allocated to each of the strands funded under the RAPID Programme.</P>

        <Quest> if, arising from his previously expressed views in this regard, his attention has been drawn to the concerns of some rural communities arising from the decisions made by a number of local authorities to refuse planning permission to the indigenous population thereby likely to cause rural depopulation; if he has had discussions with his Ministerial colleagues with a view to addressing this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The question of planning permission is primarily a matter for local authorities and these operate under guidelines and legislation prepared by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>I am cognisant however, of the concerns of some rural communities regarding the issues around the granting of planning permission.</P><Col N="944"/>
        <P>I believe that balanced physical planning is crucial and it is to ensure this balance that the National Spatial Strategy clearly sets out the principals on which one-off houses should be granted in the countryside. It clearly articulates the right of those, with a connection to the countryside by way of background or by way of employment, to live and be granted planning permission in rural Ireland. On the other hand the National Spatial Strategy, particularly in areas under urban pressures, sets its face squarely against the explosion of urban generated housing.</P>

	<P>The telephone allowance is a component of the household benefits package which is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare payment or who satisfy a means test. It is also available to people aged under 66 who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments. </P>
        <P>The primary objective of the telephone allowance scheme is to ensure access to help in an emergency and to provide an element of security. A secondary objective is to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.  In April 2007 the telephone allowance was extended to include mobile phones. Since then people have the choice of either opting for a direct credit to a telephone company for their landline or for a cash payment in respect of their mobile phone. Getting a mobile phone may be an option for people who are experiencing disruption to their landline service. People who wish to switch their telephone allowance to a mobile phone can receive a cash payment from the Department towards the cost of the mobile service.   There are currently over 15,000 people availing of the mobile phone option.</P>

	<P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>One of the fundamental qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant is that the person be providing full-time care and attention to a person who needs such care.</P>
        <P>Since the introduction of the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme this full time care and attention requirement has been eased in order to facilitate carers in engaging in employment, education or training.</P><Col N="946"/>
        <P>The number of hours a person may engage in employment, self employment, training or education outside the home and still be considered to be providing full-time care and attention was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week in June 2006.</P>
        <P>Participation on a community employment scheme involves a placement of 39 hours per fortnight and so carer&rsquo;s payments are not payable to people engaged on community employment schemes.</P>
        <P>Although there are no plans to increase the number of hours for which people can engage in employment, education or training outside the home and still be eligible for a carer&rsquo;s payment, the issue of training for carers is being examined in the context of the development of the National Carers Strategy.</P>

	<P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>Carer&rsquo;s allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means tested.  This ensures scarce resources are directed at those in greatest need.    The primary objective of the carer&rsquo;s allowance is to provide income support to low income carers. The carer&rsquo;s allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes.  It has been significantly eased over the years, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.</P>
        <P>Increases to the carer&rsquo;s allowance income disregard provided for in Budget 2008 mean that, since April, a single person can have an income of &euro;332.50 per week and a couple can have an income of up to &euro;665 per week and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The previous levels were &euro;320 and &euro;640 per week respectively.</P>
        <P>This ensures that a couple can have an income in the region of &euro;37,200 per year and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package and the respite care grant.  This increase surpasses the &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; commitment to ensuring that those on average earnings can qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>Budget 2007 provided for new arrangements whereby people can receive a maximum payment equivalent to a half rate carers allowance while receiving another social welfare payment, other than jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance.  To date, over 13,000 carers have benefited from these arrangements.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.    A carer who is caring for two or more people is entitled to a full grant for each of the care recipients.   The rate of the grant increased to &euro;1,700 per year from June 2008.</P>

	<P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA), which is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, an exceptional needs payment may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.</P>
        <P>The principal consideration in making a single payment of SWA to address a particular need is that the need to be met must be &lsquo;exceptional&rsquo;. Payments should arise only under abnormal conditions and should not become a regular or standard practice. Thus, an exceptional needs payment should be a single payment to meet an unforeseen and/or special need which cannot be met from a client&rsquo;s basic income.</P>
        <P>Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need.</P>

	<P>Spouses working for self-employed contributors are specifically excepted from social insurance contributions. However, spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are thus liable to social insurance contributions. </P>
        <P>On foot of a Programme for Government commitment an information leaflet, &lsquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rsquo;, has been developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business. It was published on the 25th of June, 2008.</P>
        <P>The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria. In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI and build up entitlement towards a contributory state pension and other Social Welfare benefits. Application for benefits would take place in the usual way, following any approval of an application for commercial partnership status and the payment of any resulting PRSI liabilities.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners use the following factors to decide if a partnership normally exists:</P><Col N="948"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />there is a written partnership agreement (a written agreement is not required by law, however);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />each partner writes cheques on the business accounts in their own right; there is a joint business account;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />it is apparent to those doing business with the partnership that a partnership exists;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />business accounts and activities are in joint names of the partners;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />each partner makes a significant contribution to the running of the business;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the business is owned jointly by the partnership;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the profits and losses of the partnership are shared by each partner; the business stationery reflects the existence of a partnership.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">An applicant should meet some of these general criteria if they are claiming to be in a partnership with their spouse. If they cannot do this, they will be deemed not to be in a business partnership.  The leaflet, which is not specifically targeted to any group of self-employed workers, may be of interest to self-employed workers and their spouses generally. Persons interested in applying for partnership status should firstly study a copy of the leaflet, available from the Information Section of the Department or at www.welfare.ie , which sets out the application procedure in detail.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) provides for a supplement to be paid in respect of mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.</P>
        <P>Mortgage interest supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently &euro; 13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than &euro;13 because they are required, subject to certain income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have, over and above the appropriate SWA rate, towards their accommodation costs.</P>
        <P>Since June 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. &lsquo;Additional income&rsquo; is the amount of income in excess of the SWA rate, applicable to household circumstances and includes income derived from part-time employment or self- employment (under 30 hours per week), any employment or training scheme (e.g. CE or F&Aacute;S course), family income supplement and maintenance payments in excess of &euro;95.23.</P>
        <P>Arrangements are in place to allow a person to participate in approved employment or t raining schemes or engage in full-time employment and retain entitlement to mortgage interest supplement on a tapered basis for up to 4 years in certain circumstances.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the current mortgage interest supplement scheme provides an adequate short-term &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; within the overall social welfare system to ensure that people <Col N="950"/>do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment. Nonetheless I intend to keep the scheme under review to ensure that the schemes meet the objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>The Executive has advised that the person concerned had been in receipt of rent supplement until 13 September 2008. Payment of the supplement ceased as the person concerned is in full-time education and is not in receipt of a back to education allowance. If the person concerned is not satisfied with the decision of the Executive, it is open to her to lodge an appeal against the decision.</P>
        <P>People in full-time education are normally excluded from receipt of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. However, people participating in approved courses who qualify for back to education allowance, receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of their previous social welfare payment. They may also qualify for rent supplement, subject to the standard qualifying conditions of the rent supplement scheme.</P>

Following the submission of further medical evidence, the Chief Medical Adviser confirmed his original opinion.</P>
        <P>An appeal was opened in the case on 14 May 2008 and I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that this appeal has been referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing. The person concerned will be informed when arrangements have been made.</P>

	<P>It is the Department&rsquo;s policy to work closely with the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to its response to any incident where laptops are stolen which contain confidential client information.   In the most recent incident involving the contents of a missing laptop from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department wrote to all those whose personal details were contained on the laptop.   A dedicated freephone helpline was also put in place to deal with any issues the customers affected might have.  The Commissioner welcomed the manner in which the Department addressed the issue and stated publicly that he considered that this approach represented &lsquo;best practice and a truly first rate response in the circumstances&rsquo;.</P><Col N="952"/>
        <P>Every effort is being taken to avoid loss of equipment and the Department is continuing to enhance its protection of personal data.  The Department&rsquo;s policy is that sensitive data should not be stored on laptops.   However, in the event that there is no alternative to local storage, all sensitive data must be appropriately secured.  All new laptops are issued with encryption software.  The Department is currently arranging a recall of its current stock of laptops to install encryption software.   This process is expected to be completed by the end of December 2008.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2006, a wide range of important reforms were announced for non-contributory pensioners, including self employed pensioners, in conjunction with the introduction of the State pension (non- contributory). The new pension replaced a range of non-contributory payments for persons aged 66 and over including the old age pension.</P>
        <P>All these schemes currently featured a common means disregard of &euro;7.60 per week, which had not increased since the 1970s. This general disregard was increased to &euro;20 with effect from September 2006 and was subsequently increased to &euro;30 with effect from January 2007. Approximately, 34,000 pensioners who were in receipt of a reduced rate of payment gained from these changes, including many self employed pensioners. Persons in receipt of the reduced personal rates of pensions gained by up to &euro;22.50 per week with additional gains for persons with qualified adults.</P>
        <P>In addition, from September 2006, a specific additional earnings disregard of &euro;100 per week (now &euro;200 per week) was also introduced where the pensioner is in employment i.e. working for an employer.  This disregard is intended to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working, or to re-enter the workforce.  This disregard does not apply to income from any other sources.  Income from sources other than employment, including self employed income was covered by the enhanced general means disregard of &euro;30 per week referred to above.</P>

	<P>The Department delivers a frontline service through a network of 59 Local Offices and 65 Branch Offices countrywide. Local Offices are staffed by civil servants whereas the Branch Offices operate under a contract for service.   The staffing levels at Branch Offices are a matter for individual Branch Managers.  All decisions on claims are made in Local Offices.</P><Col N="953"/>
        <P>The total number of staff assigned to Local Offices at end of September 2008 was 1,343 as compared with 1,280 in September 2007 and all of these staff are engaged in front-line services. Details of staff assigned to individual offices are set out in the attached tabular statement.</P>
        <P>In 5 of the offices the numbers shown for September 2008 are lower than those applying in 2007. This is for a number of reasons including the point in time at which the staff numbers were determined, the loss of the PPS allocation function to a centralised location and staff vacancies at September 2008.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s Management Services Unit, using a formal work measurement method, monitors staffing requirements across the Department including Local Offices. Determinations of staffing requirements undertaken on an office by office basis, was carried out over the period mid 2006 to mid 2008.</P>
        <P>In addition to this process, because the increased number of claims for jobseeker payments the Department undertook a review of staffing levels in Local Offices in May and June of this year.  This resulted in the assignment of an additional 31 staff to some 15 Local Offices.  A further such review currently is being undertaken.</P>
        <P>A number of other measures have been taken to deal with the increased workload, including extending the contracts of some temporary staff and the allocation of additional resources for overtime.</P>
        <P>At the end of September 2007 the Live Register stood at 160,451 and at the end of September 2008 it was 240,217.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to reform water charges on farmers including the introduction of a special livestock rate to support investment and structural reforms in agriculture; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Water charges apply to the farming sector in the same way as such charges apply to any business.  Local authorities are required to recover the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes. The Government&rsquo;s water pricing policy provides for full cost recovery without profit, with charges based on actual metered consumption. Metering incentivises all non-domestic users, including farmers, to manage and conserve their use of water. That is an essential element in implementation of the polluter pays principle required by the Water Framework Directive.</P>
        <P>In relation to a livestock rate of water charge, the requirement for non-domestic consumers to pay for water services applies regardless of the use to which the water is put.  Public water supply schemes provide only treated water to consumers. It would not be practicable or appropriate to supply a lower quality of water to farm customers.</P>

	<P>My responsibilities under the Wildlife Acts relate to the conservation of populations of certain protected species including the badger. Badgers may not be hunted, injured or wilfully interfered with or their breeding place destroyed. However, the legislation enables me, as Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to issue a licence to a person to capture and humanely kill a protected wild animal for specified scientific or other purposes.</P>
        <P>Since 2004, 30 licences have been issued annually to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food &mdash; one for each District Veterinary Office (DVO).  There is one DVO per county, with the exception of County Cork, which has 3, and Counties Tipperary and Wicklow, which have 2 DVOs each.</P>
        <P>Prior to 2004, licences were issued for each individual epidemiological investigation rather than by area. The distribution by county of these earlier licences is not available.</P>
        <P>The licences permit taking of badgers for the purpose of carrying out necessary research into bovine tuberculosis in cattle and badgers. The badger has been identified as an important reservoir of Mycobacterium bovis, the bacterium that causes bovine tuberculosis (TB).</P>
        <P>Licences issued in this regard are subject to strict conditions and must comply with the Part 3(d) of Wildlife Act 1976 (Approved Traps, Snares and Nets) Regulations 2003 which stipulates that a &ldquo;stopped body restraint&rdquo; must be used when capturing badgers.</P>
        <P>A schedule of the number of licenses issued in the period 1997-2008 to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is given in the following table.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>In May 2008 my Department made a combined capital allocation of &euro;71.4 million available to local authorities for the operation of the Housing Adaptation Grant schemes for Older People and People with a Disability in private houses in 2008. Individual allocations were notified to local authorities based on their estimated requirements as notified to my Department on expenditure trends in recent years. The high level of publicity surrounding the revised grant schemes since their launch in November 2007 has led to an increased level of activity being experienced by local authorities this year.</P>
        <P>Requests have been received from a number of local authorities for supplementary allocations in respect of the Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes and the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Schemes. In response to the particularly high levels of activity under the revised schemes experienced in 2008 by certain local authorities, my Department recently made supplementary Exchequer allocations totalling &euro;3.6 million towards the operation of these schemes this year. This information is set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>The issue of a further round of supplementary allocations to other local authorities will be considered in the event of further funding becoming available. My Department has re-emphasised to local authorities the importance of prioritisation in assessing grant applications given the level of activity being experienced nationally.</P>

	<P>The website of the Government&rsquo;s climate change awareness campaign, www.change.ie, provides a carbon calculator which enables people to work out their own carbon footprint.  Using this tool, it is estimated that the carbon emissions from air travel undertaken in the course of my ministerial functions amounted to 7.87 tonnes in the year to 30 June 2008.  This amount is accounted for predominately by air travel to UN Conferences in Bali and New York.</P>
        <P>There is no equivalent figure for the previous year as I did not take up my Ministerial position until 14 June 2007.</P><Col N="959"/>
        <P>The Department of Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform, which has responsibility for the Ministerial transport fleet, is providing statistics on road mileage to my Department for the period to 30 June 2008 and, once obtained, the revised carbon footprint for my combined road and air travel will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Using the same tool, it has been calculated that the carbon footprint arising from the functions of the Ministers of State at my Department is: Minister of State Finneran (Housing, Urban Renewal and Developing Areas) &mdash; 2.61 tonnes.  This is based on mileage figures provided in respect of the period 13 May 2008 to 30 June 2008. Minister of State Kitt (Environment) &mdash; 4.78 tonnes.  This is based on mileage figures provided in respect of the period 13 May 2008 to 31 August 2008.</P>
        <P>Neither Minister of State has undertaken any official air travel since taking up their respective posts.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children will provide a response in respect of Minister of State Hoctor as her functions (Minister of State with responsibility for Older People) are shared with that Department.</P>
        <P>In line with the Programme for Government, the Government Carbon Offsetting Scheme is now in place for all official air travel. All air travel mentioned above is subject to the Scheme.</P>

	<P>Section 48 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides that planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority that benefit development in the area.  Development contribution schemes are drawn up by each planning authority and approved by the elected members following a public consultation process.</P>
        <P>My Department has no role in forecasting the annual development contributions income across local authorities.  As Minister, my role is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.</P>
        <P>Details of individual development contribution schemes are available directly from each planning authority. Each planning authority is also required to include details of contributions received and contributions owing to it, together with information on how the contributions have been expended, in the statutory annual report of the authority.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s Annual Planning Statistics for 2006, which gives an unaudited breakdown of Development Contribution income for Local Authorities, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.environ.ie. The 2007 Annual Planning Statistics are currently being finalised and I expect to make them available on my Department&rsquo;s website within two weeks.</P>

        <P>The amount of financial contributions received, in lieu of the transfer of land, to satisfy the Part V condition is dependent on the level and commencement of private sector residential development and, crucially, the nature of Part V agreements entered into.  Accordingly, it is not possible to forecast the amount that each housing authority might accept in any given year.</P>

	<P>My Department is currently examining options to strengthen legislation on noise pollution, with a view to meeting the Programme for Government commitment to publish comprehensive legislation on noise pollution as a matter of priority.  A consultation paper was published on 27 August 2008 which outlines possible future measures which could be introduced to further alleviate noise nuisance. These include the possibility of extending improved powers of local authorities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as direct intervention in certain cases.</P>
        <P>As part of this general public consultation process, my Department has written separately to the key stakeholders, including Government Departments, the Office of the Attorney General and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to ascertain their views on the issues raised in the consultation paper.  Any views received will be followed up in more detailed discussions as appropriate.   The deadline for submissions on the consultation paper is 31 October, 2008.</P>

Under Water Services legislation, the owner of a premises is responsible for ensuring that the internal water distribution system is sufficient to ensure that drinking water quality requirements are complied with.</P>
        <P>In addition to replacing lead services, appropriate pH correction can be made at water treatments plants to ensure the water is not corrosive and to prevent lead from old pipes leaching into supply.  The dosing of phosphates has also been recommended by the EPA to local authorities as a means of reducing plumbosolvency (ability of water to dissolve lead) as it has the further effect of sealing the lead within the connections.</P>

	<P>The cost incurred to date of the Government&rsquo;s communications and awareness campaign on climate change, the Change Campaign, is &euro;4,151,146 (exclusive of VAT), which will be funded from the Environment Fund.  The anticipated costs for the remainder of the year will be of the order of &euro;2,187,722 (exclusive of VAT).</P>
        <P>The over-riding goal of the campaign is to drive significant behavioural change to reduce and avoid greenhouse gas emissions. The strategic starting point was to create a shared understanding of the challenge. This is being done through working with stakeholder groups, through TV, radio and outdoor advertising, the use of web-based tools, public events and intensive media engagement.</P>
        <P>The Change Campaign differs from most other public information campaigns in that the approach includes a significant stakeholder engagement element. Much of the resources of this campaign are being used in working in partnership with stakeholders from various sectors to develop appropriate, relevant and useful tools and techniques to lower greenhouse gas emissions.  A Carbon Management Tool for organizations, being developed as part of the campaign, is expected to be launched in the Spring.</P>
        <P>The campaign website, www.change.ie, is an important vehicle for providing information to the public and the campaign encourages people to play their full part in contributing towards Ireland&rsquo;s response to the global challenge of climate change.  Since I launched a user-friendly <Col N="963"/>carbon calculator as a development of the website on 5 May 2008, almost 63,000 people have calculated their carbon count number.</P>

	<P>On 7 March 2008, in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 of the National Monuments Act 1930 (as amended), I placed a preservation order on the national monument known as Rath Lugh in the townland of Lismullin, County Meath.</P>
        <P>To assess the stability of the esker on which the monument is located, I commissioned a report from a firm of independent consultants with relevant expertise in this matter. The report recommended that a number of precautionary measures be put in place to ensure that the esker is not undermined during the nearby road construction works or in the longer term.</P>
        <P>On 14 August 2008, the National Roads Authority informed my Department that the construction of a crib wall on the esker had been completed. The purpose of this wall is to secure the stability of the slope of the esker on which the national monument is located during the construction works and in the longer term when the motorway is in operation. This approach was confirmed as an appropriate solution by the independent consultants.</P>
        <P>The relevant reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I have arranged for regular inspections to be carried out by my Department to monitor and assess the condition of the national monument at Rath Lugh. The aim of the inspections is to monitor any impacts on the monument and to assess any impacts that may be caused by the works on the motorway.</P>
        <P>The lands on which the monument is located are owned by Coillte, the semi-State forestry body. My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service has been in contact with Coillte regarding the protection of the monument and has received Coillte&rsquo;s full co-operation in this matter. My <Col N="964"/>Department will, in addition, be meeting with Coillte later this month to discuss the ongoing protection of the monument.  I am satisfied that appropriate arrangements are in place to monitor the ongoing protection of the national monument.</P>

	<P>&euro;4.7 billion has been provided for my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes in the National Development Plan 2007 &mdash; 2013, an increase of 27% on the previous NDP.  </P>
        <P>The water supply schemes approved for funding under the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009, (which is available in the Oireachtas Library) are derived from assessments of needs undertaken by local authorities, at my Department&rsquo;s request, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting water supply requirements.  Among the criteria local authorities are required to take into account in preparing their needs assessments are compliance with national and EU drinking water treatment requirements and relevant reports produced by the EPA in relation to drinking water standards.  Annual block grant allocations by my Department to local authorities under the devolved Rural Water Programme are informed by prioritised work programmes submitted by county councils.</P><Col N="965"/>
        <P>Earlier this year, in conjunction with publication of its report &ldquo;The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland: A Report of the Years 2006-2007&rdquo;, the EPA listed 339 public water supplies where detailed profiling was required to ensure consumers had a reliable supply of a consistently satisfactory standard.  Every major upgrading scheme required has been approved for funding under the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009.  I have also allocated special funding to local authorities for smaller scale upgrading works to schemes included in the EPA list.</P>
        <P>99% of tests of public water supplies are clear of lead, as required under drinking water regulations.  However, the EPA can issue such directions to a local authority as are necessary to prevent or remove any health risk.  Failure to comply with such a direction is an indictable offence and subject to heavy penalties.</P>
        <P>The Drinking Water (No. 2) Regulations, 2007, greatly strengthened the enforcement provisions in relation to drinking water standards. The Regulations provide for the supervision of local authority drinking water supplies by the EPA, and I have provided substantial additional funding and staffing resources to the EPA to increase its monitoring and enforcement capacity in relation to water standards generally.</P>

	<P>The Nitrates Directive and Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme are given legal effect by the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 and 2007. These Regulations provide for a review, by the EPA, of progress made in implementing the Regulations.  The Agency is required to submit a report to me by 31 December 2008 with the results of the review and with recommendations as to such additional measures, if any, as appear to be necessary to reduce and prevent water pollution from agricultural sources.</P>
        <P>In preparing its report the Agency is required to consult with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the co-ordinating local authority in each river basin district and other such persons as it considers appropriate.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Regulations, and following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and with other interested parties, I will prepare and publish a <Col N="966"/>new Nitrates Action Programme by 30 June 2009. Detailed provisions with regard to public consultation on the Action Programme are set out in the Regulations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Turf cutting may continue as normal on the vast majority of bogs in 2009. </P>
        <P>A small number of bogs are protected because they are nature conservation sites of European importance under the EU Habitats Directive and as such have been nominated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs).</P>
        <P>For 32 raised bog SACs, which were nominated for designation in 1999, turf cutting is due to come to an end at the close of the current season, following the expiry of a 10-year period of grace.  This period was allowed to give turf cutters the opportunity to find alternative sources of fuel.  A list of the bogs concerned accompanies this reply.</P>
        <P>Since 1999, the use of &ldquo;sausage&rdquo; machines is not permitted in SACs or Natural Heritage Areas, either on blanket or raised bogs.  &ldquo;Hoppers&rdquo;, or other hand-held machines, used for cutting for purely domestic use, are permitted generally, but not, of course, where all cutting is prohibited.  Cutting may continue as usual on undesignated bogs.</P>

	<P>In 2007, my Department reviewed the Planning Regulations with regard to exempted developments and carried out research into the planning implications of exempting renewable energy technologies in the industrial, business and agricultural sectors, with a view to providing specific exemptions wherever possible to encourage uptake of such technologies.  On foot of this work, a consultation paper outlining proposed exemptions was issued in October 2007.  A total of 51 submissions were received and carefully considered.</P>
        <P>In July 2008, the Oireachtas approved the Planning and Development Regulations 2008, providing planning exemptions for specified renewable technologies in the industrial, business and agricultural sectors.  A summary of the classes of micro-renewable technology exemptions applicable to agricultural sites is attached.  These exemptions should reduce the demands placed on the planning system, while facilitating a greater penetration of these renewable technologies, <Col N="969"/>thereby providing cleaner and cheaper energy and helping our wider efforts to tackle climate change, improve security of energy supply, and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.</P>
        <P>The introduction of equivalent exemptions for anaerobic digesters, building-mounted wind turbines and hydro-power was considered, but it was decided that these technologies should remain subject to the provisions of the planning system. However, I intend to keep this matter under review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 395 to 398, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>A new Government strategy on homelessness, The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008 &mdash; 2013, was published in August 2008.  The strategy builds on the strong progress made under previous strategies and sets out a vision to address adult homelessness over the next five years.</P>
        <P>The strategy recognises that homelessness involves a complex interplay between personal, economic, social and structural issues and reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing homelessness in a comprehensive and coordinated manner.  It was developed under the aegis of a Cross Departmental Team, which comprises representatives from the relevant Government Departments and agencies, ensuring a whole of Government approach is adopted.  In addition, a National Homeless Consultative Committee, which includes representatives from homeless service providers, both statutory and voluntary, was established in April 2007 and was consulted during the Strategy&rsquo;s preparation.</P>
        <P>The strategy sets outs a range of actions under each of its six strategic aims, together with implementation targets for the most significant actions.  These will form the basis of a more detailed implementation plan being developed under the aegis of the Cross Departmental Team on Homelessness, which will assign lead roles and more detailed time lines.  Work on the implementation plan is underway and submissions have been requested from relevant non-governmental organisations through their representatives on the National Homeless Consultative Committee.  I expect the Implementation Plan to be finalised by end 2008.</P><Col N="972"/>
        <P>Since 2000, over &euro;620 million has been provided for homeless services, between accommodation-related costs met through my Department and the local authorities, and care services funded through the Health Service Executive.  In 2008 alone, almost &euro;92 million in current funding is being provided.  Further significant capital funding has also been provided for the development of new facilities.</P>
        <P>Future funding of actions under the strategy will be a matter for consideration in the context of the annual Estimates process and it will also be essential to ensure that optimum efficiency and value for money are secured from funding provided.  In that context, the Homeless Agency in Dublin has been undertaking a comprehensive review of services and a value for money review; when completed shortly, these will play an important role in informing the development of the strategy&rsquo;s implementation plan and consideration of associated funding issues.   	</P>

	<P>Intelligent lighting systems offer very significant potential for energy efficiency savings in buildings.  Many new public buildings are including advanced lighting systems that encompass high-efficiency fittings and advanced controls.  Retrofit solutions are also available and can sometimes offer attractive returns on investment, but are not always economically justified.  I understand that it has been the practice of the Office of Public Works for many years to install such systems in its new buildings where economically practicable.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has commenced its &ldquo;Bright Ideas&rdquo; national roadshow on lighting solutions for business, including public sector organisations.  This event will be visiting 5 venues countrywide over the months of October and November.  The roadshow is providing an educational and networking forum for the entire lighting supply chain, practical actionable advice on how to use lighting in an effective and efficient manner and case studies of local organisations who have worked with SEI to reduce their lighting energy consumption and manage their energy costs.  SEI has also published the first three guides in a series of nine sector-specific, high-efficiency lighting guides for business.</P>
        <P>Through these and other programmes, SEI is highlighting the energy savings and other benefits available from new advanced lighting systems.  This complements the accelerated capital allowances for energy efficient equipment introduced in the Finance Act 2008 to encourage take-up by industry of more energy efficient equipment.  Efficient lighting and lighting controls are included among the classes of eligible technology under the Accelerated Capital Allowances Scheme.</P>

Using this tool, my Department has estimated that the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>  emissions arising in the course of my ministerial functions for the period 14 June 2007 to 14 June 2008 amounted to 11.38 tonnes.

	<P>I am aware of the analysis published by EirGrid in 2007, which provides a framework to assess cost implications of wind powered generation under a range of scenarios.

It is also the case that since the 2007 framework was published fossil fuel prices have risen exponentially and the Single Wholesale Electricity Market has been established.  EirGrid, as Ireland&rsquo;s systems operator, is committed to supporting the delivery of renewable energy and to meeting the challenges for the electricity system and the most effective and efficient operation of the overall generation portfolio.  The Generation portfolio is changing with the prospective development of more flexible plant which EirGrid advocates and supports.  EirGrid also considers that the Single Electricity Market design supports the addition of more flexible plant, which is reflected in the increased level of interest in such plant.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of EirGrid to optimise the efficiency of the generation portfolio through, inter alia, the dispatch daily arrangements for all generating plants.  I welcome the fact that EirGrid as Systems and Market Operator is committed to delivering increased penetration of renewable energy.  As fossil fuel and carbon prices continue to rise, renewable energy technologies come into their own. My Department has requested ESRI to analyse the economic and financial costs and potential impact on electricity prices of Ireland&rsquo;s ambitious renewable energy targets.  That work will be completed by year end.  The Commission for Energy Regulation is also undertaking jointly with the Northern Ireland Regulator analysis of the impact of wind generation in the Single Electricity Market.  This analysis will be completed shortly.</P>

	<P>The East-West Interconnector is a 500MW High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) interconnector, which will link the electricity grids of Ireland and Britain.  This project is of strategic national importance to Ireland and its delivery to schedule by 2012 is a key Government priority.  The interconnector will enhance the reliability and security of electricity supply, promote competition in the market and facilitate the integration of renewables.</P>
        <P>EirGrid has been entrusted with the development and ownership of this interconnector by the Government.  Working closely with the CER and with my Department, Eirgrid is progressing the project to schedule.  The Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Act 2008 provides the necessary legal basis for EirGrid to construct, own and operate an interconnector.</P>
        <P>I am advised that EirGrid expects the contract for design and construction of the interconnector to be completed by late 2008, when the successful bidder will be announced. EirGrid has secured Woodland in County Meath as the connection point for the interconnector on the Irish transmission system and Deeside in Wales on the UK side.  Furthermore, EirGrid has undertaken a marine survey to determine the most suitable route for the undersea cable.  Late 2011 is the target for the completion of works and 2012 is the target for the completion of <Col N="975"/>commissioning and testing and the start of commercial operations.  The project remains on track to meet these target completion dates, subject to the outcome of the planning processes.</P>
        <P>Financing options for this project are being pursued by EirGrid with the objective of achieving the most cost-effective and efficient financial package.</P>
        <P>The project is being funded in two phases.  Phase 1 will cover the initial funding requirements and Phase 2 will cover the majority of the construction element.  EirGrid has gone to the market for proposals in relation to Phase 1.  Once the Phase 1 funding package is in place, EirGrid will proceed to seek proposals in relation to Phase 2.  This phase will cover the bulk of funding requirements.  EirGrid has also initiated discussions with the European Investment Bank, with a view to their participation in Phase 2.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the all island grid study that suggests Ireland could receive a possible 42% of it&rsquo;s electricity from renewable energy sources, mostly wind, by 2020 and that the study outlines that this would require some six gigawatts of wind turbines connected to the grid by then; his plan to raise his renewable energy target; his estimate of the amount and value of fossil fuels that will be saved in each of the next ten years; his estimate of the amount and value of emissions avoided in each of the next ten years; the amount by which fossil fuel generating plant capacity will be reduced in each of the next ten years; the amount of applications for wind turbines at present through the various Gate schemes; if he envisages a scheme whereby large amounts of wind turbines may be operational before their planned targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The All-Island Grid Study concluded that it is feasible to generate 42% of electricity on the island of Ireland from renewable energy sources by 2020 subject to a number of factors including the pace and scale of grid development and reinforcement and the development of more flexible conventional operational capacity on the system.</P>
        <P>The study shows that we have the potential to do more than reach the Government target of 33% renewables which I consider to be the base rather than the limit of our ambitions.  Achieving existing targets and aiming higher again is my objective, subject to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s overall competitiveness and system security.</P>
        <P>This is a complex challenge requiring major investment in our electricity transmission network and very significant investment from the conventional generation and renewables sector itself.  We are putting in place the necessary strategies to deliver on our national and EU targets to ensure we can fully meet the energy and climate change challenges set out by successive European Councils.</P>
        <P>The economic analysis module of the grid study was carried out by Ecofys.  The modelling work in the study takes a snapshot in time in that it finds that, by 2020, in meeting a 42% renewable generation share, the net effect allows for a 25% reduction in carbon emissions and a 28% reduction in gas imports for electricity generation over the Grid Study&rsquo;s reference case, which is a 16% share of renewable generation capacity.</P>
        <P>The All-island Grid Study itself recommends that further work be carried out to build on the analysis.  Electricity market modelling work is currently being carried out by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) jointly with the Northern Ireland Regulator.  I have also requested the Economic and Social Research Institute to assess the financial and economic <Col N="976"/>costs and benefits of the renewable energy targets, which will further inform strategies to achieve those targets.</P>
        <P>The latest figures on wind capacity from EirGrid show that there are 850MW of wind connected to the Irish system, 1,700MW with signed or open connection offers and over 7,500MW of capacity still in the queue.</P>
        <P>The matter of connections to the electricity grid is one for the CER working with EirGrid.  CER recently completed a public consultation on the current &lsquo;Gate 3&rsquo; process under which CER proposes that 3,000MW of new renewable energy projects are brought forward into the connection process.  Industry players have made a range of submissions under the consultation process and these are currently being considered by CER.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my statement of 13 March on the future of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity sector.  In that statement I affirmed the Government&rsquo;s decision in the Energy Policy White Paper and the Programme for Government, to transfer the ownership of the electricity transmission assets from ESB to EirGrid.</P>
        <P>The unbundling of the transmission assets involves the resolution of complex technical, financial and operational issues as well as the introduction of legislation.  The process will take us beyond the original target date of the end of 2008, as all the parties concerned are aware.</P>
        <P>In the context, not least, of wide-ranging challenging priorities for ESB and EirGrid, I have proposed that we commission an independent analysis of the transmission transfer, including costs, benefits and regulatory impact assessment, set in the context also of EU developments and the all island single electricity market.</P>
        <P>I have consistently underlined the need for transparent and inclusive engagement with all relevant stakeholders in the process of implementing Government policy in relation to the electricity transmission assets.</P>
        <P>Input to the process of independent analysis will accordingly be invited from the direct key stakeholders.  These are the management and unions of ESB and EirGrid, the ESB Employee Share Ownership Trust, as well as the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>All the direct stakeholders have pivotal roles to play in the process of engagement and analysis and in achieving outcomes that are good for EirGrid and ESB, which are satisfactory for all parties concerned, and which are in the best interests of the economy and consumers.</P>
        <P>It is not possible at this stage to provide an estimate of the likely cost of the independent analysis process.  I look forward to getting this collective process of engagement and analysis under way following my appointment of the senior independent chair, which I intend to finalise shortly.  It is my aim that this process would be completed during 2009.</P>

	<P>The Commission for Energy Regulation/ESB Networks have recently amended the rules associated with small scale generators.  It is now the case that generators of less than 6kW on single phase electricity and 11kW on three phase electricity supply cables can now connect their generators without prior authorisation.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) will shortly publish a guide to connecting renewable and CHP electricity generators to the electricity network including advice for micro-generators.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In April of this year I announced a new support programme to underpin 50 trials of small scale wind and Photovoltaic electricity generators operating domestic and non-domestic applications. The trials will benchmark the performance and reliability of the technologies and gauge their market impact potential.  The programme, which is administered by SEI, will be receiving applications shortly, following a consultation with stakeholders.  The programme will also inform consideration of a feed-in-tariff mechanism for electricity produced through micro-generation.</P>
        <P>SEI&rsquo;s Low Carbon Housing programme is providing incentives to developers planning to include Photovoltaic and other autogeneration technologies in prospective developments.  This programme supersedes the &ldquo;House of Tomorrow&rdquo; programme and is designed to support and promote low energy consumption and low carbon dioxide emissions in new dwellings, to a level of performance beyond the envisaged revisions to the Building Regulations in 2010.  Subject to overall budgetary considerations, grant support of up to &euro;15,000 per unit based on 40% of eligible expenditure is available for whole house solutions incorporating energy efficiency design and renewable energy technology features.</P>
        <P>The revised Building Regulations Part L now require the mandatory inclusion of renewable energy systems in a domestic building.  The Building Energy Rating (BER) certification system also allows homeowners to improve their BER by incorporating PV systems into the building.</P>
        <P>In February 2007 exemptions from the requirement to apply for planning permission for certain categories of micro-generation technologies including Solar Photovoltaic were introduced under Statutory Instrument. S.I. No. 83 of 2007 &ldquo;Planning and Development Regulations 2007&rdquo;.  Following further consultation last year, SI 235 of 2008 &ldquo;Planning and Development Regulations 2008&rdquo;, provides for further planning exemptions for additional classes of renewable energy installations including large Solar Photovoltaic installations.</P>

	<P>The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  Broadband services are available from competing service providers over multiple platforms such as DSL (telephone lines), cable, fixed wireless, and increasingly mobile.  I understand that the Burtonport area already has broadband on offer from a number of service providers.</P>
        <P>The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard, my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS), <Col N="979"/>investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) which is designed to deliver broadband to areas where the market has failed to deliver the necessary investment.  The NBS contract is scheduled to be signed early next month, with rollout of services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter, subject to agreement with the chosen service provider.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Approximately 50% of the badgers captured under the programme have been subjected to post mortem.  Research undertaken by UCD on behalf of my Department has shown that, where detailed post mortem with culturing of tissues is undertaken, TB has been confirmed in approximately 48% of badgers.</P>
        <P>A key element of the Department&rsquo;s overall TB eradication strategy is the development and implementation of a programme for the vaccination of badgers.   Work to date in a controlled environment has shown positive results and a 3-year field trial of the orally delivered BCG vaccine is about to commence.  However it will be some time before benefits of the vaccine will be seen and therefore it is envisaged that the current badger policy will be retained in the medium term.</P>

	<P>The current funding available for decommissioning is provided to enable immediate decommissioning of vessels from the fleet so as to improve the economic viability of the remainder of the fleet. The general position in the Irish fishing industry in recent years is that there has been an overall shortage of crewmen. Accordingly, and as only a portion of the fleet is being decommissioned, it could be expected that many crew members on vessels which are decommissioning will be able to find alternative employment elsewhere in the industry.</P>
        <P>All fishermen are eligible to undertake Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) training programmes including those serving on vessels that are decommissioning. In this regard, BIM and F&Aacute;S have agreed to co-operate to provide training for fishing vessel crew members that find themselves without a job when their fishing vessel is decommissioned. Both agencies will work closely together to provide retraining, up-skilling or diversification opportunities in the seafood industry or elsewhere in the economy as required.</P>
        <P>Under the EU Seafood Development Operational Programme for Ireland (2007-2013), &euro; 7.2M has been set aside for the sustainable development and improvement of the quality of life in fisheries areas and to maintain economic and social prosperity in these communities.</P>

	<P>The requirements in relation to ploughing are set out in the Nitrates Regulations introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2006 (SI No. 378 of 2006). These Regulations require that:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />When ploughing arable land between 1 July and 15 January green cover must be provided from a sown crop within six weeks.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Grassland ploughed between 1 July and 15 October must have green cover from a sown crop by 1 November.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Grassland must not be ploughed between 16 October and 30 November.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The overall objective of the Regulations is to protect water quality.  Scientific evidence indicates that significant nutrient loss can occur when grassland or arable land is ploughed and where there is no crop planted shortly after ploughing to take up the nutrients that will be released when the buried organic matter breaks down. The provisions of the Regulations are designed to minimise such nutrient losses and do not allow for any flexibility on the designated restricted periods.</P>
        <P>The contents of the Regulations, including those in relation to ploughing, were the subject of extensive consultation with stakeholders, including the farming bodies, and were finalised following a long period of negotiation with the EU Commission.</P>

	<P>The website of the Government&rsquo;s climate change awareness campaign, <i>www.change.ie</i>, provides a carbon calculator which enables everyone to work out their own carbon footprint.   Using this tool, my Department has estimated that the carbon emissions related to air travel arising in the course of my ministerial functions since May 2008 amounted to 3.4 tonnes, all of which will be fully <Col N="983"/>offset under the Government&rsquo;s carbon offsetting scheme for official travel.  There is no equivalent figure for the previous year, as I did not take up the post until 7 May 2008.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The veterinary profession has my full confidence and support.  The profession plays a pivotal role in the develop<Col N="984"/>ment of our agriculture and food sectors and its members expertise and commitment in the area of animal diseases has enabled our livestock sector to progress and improve and, by so doing, to provide a safe raw material for our developing food industry.  With developments in the area of veterinary medicine and treatment techniques, considerable progress has been made in combating a range of animal diseases which otherwise would threaten the stable food supply we now take for granted.  </P>
        <P>While veterinary practice had traditionally concentrated on the management of livestock production diseases at farm level, the Department&rsquo;s veterinary inspectorate working as an integral part of my Department,  has a far wider remit.  It focuses on zoonotic diseases of public health significance, contingency planning for serious disease outbreaks and the protection of the animal feed and human food chains. In more recent years, food safety, trade and animal welfare have also become extremely important issues. Official Veterinarians now fulfil a pivotal role in carrying out inspection and certification functions at various stages in the food chain to verify both the standard of animals entering the chain and the standards of the processing operations.  The inspectorate also plays a major role in international trade for example in determining trade rules at OIE and at bilateral levels and in reassuring foreign regulators and consumers of our high animal health standing through certification functions and otherwise.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Veterinary Council of Ireland (the regulatory body of the veterinary profession) of which my Chief Veterinary Officer is a member, and the new Veterinary Practices Act 2005, polices the profession in Ireland to ensure the highest levels of professionalism and integrity are met.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the AHCS1 form is to permit testing veterinary practitioners to manually submit amendments to test details that have already been submitted electronically.  These corrections generally relate to matters such as the sex, breed, colour, ID number of animals, as well as herd identifier, date and details of test results.  The acceptance of submitted corrections on the AHCS 1 forms is at the discretion of the Superintending Veterinary Inspector (SVI) in my Department&rsquo;s local District Veterinary Office (DVO) and the use of AHCS1 forms is monitored as part of my Department&rsquo;s quality control system on the testing programme.  </P>
        <P>My Department is satisfied that this highly-visible and transparent process does not facilitate the certification of animals as being tested when they had not in fact been tested.  Up to 30 September 2008, some 6,900 AHCS1 forms were submitted to DVOs this year by testing veterinary practitioners.  This figure should be seen in the context of 329,715 herd test results recorded on AHCS in the corresponding period.  As outlined in my reply to the Deputy of 24 September 2008 (Ref No. 30581/08), my Department has strong and effective quality control measures in place to minimize the risk of fraud and professional misconduct in relation to TB testing.  If the Deputy has any evidence of illegal practices in relation to the carrying out of the TB test, perhaps he could provide this information to my Department and the matter will be fully investigated.</P>

As part of the control procedures under EU rules governing the Scheme, the application was selected for an on-farm inspection, during the course of which discrepancies were found in relation to seven of the land parcels declared by the person named.  As a result of this discrepancy, the claimed area of 122.92 hectares was reduced to 87.37 hectares, in line with the EU rules governing the scheme.  Where the total area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held, appropriate penalties must be applied; in this case, while the found area was 87.37 hectares, the number of entitlements held by the person named is 114.91, therefore, the appropriate penalty was applied viz as the difference between the area declared and the area found is more than 20%, under EU Regulations, no payment is due.</P>

	<P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority &mdash; i.e. the local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required. If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.  Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
        <P>The Special Rate of Maintenance Grant referred to by the Deputy is available to students in receipt of the ordinary maintenance grant under each of my Department&rsquo;s four maintenance grant schemes.

<P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />An applicant must qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant.</P>
<P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />Total reckonable income in the relevant tax year must not exceed the lower income limits as set out in the relevant Maintenance Grant Schemes and, where applicable, net of Child Dependent Increase payments paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
<P el="5">3. <Miles com="ix" />As at the prescribed date &mdash; i.e. 31 December each year &mdash; the source of income must include one of the eligible long-term Social Welfare payments.</P>
<P FLI="0">The prescribed income limit for the special rate of maintenance grant for the academic year 2007/2008 is &euro;20,147. It is not proposed to depart from the existing arrangements for the determination of the eligibility threshold.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Tackling inequalities in Education is a multi faceted problem which requires a multi-faceted approach.  I do not consider that addressing early childhood development requirements is in itself sufficient to solve the problems of inequalities in Education.  Internationally, it has been shown that successful enrichment programmes like the Perry Preschool programme in the US, foster long-term improvements in the home environment that carry over to the child long after the pre-school programme has ended.  The influence of the home environment on the life chances of our children cannot be under-estimated.  Our constitution recognises that the &lsquo;primary and natural educator of the child is the Family&rsquo; and in our society, the majority of pre-school children are cared for at home whether by parents or guardians, other relatives or paid childcare.  Data, drawn from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) module on Childcare, shows that in almost 60% of families, parents or guardians of pre-school children are still the main carers during the normal working day.  The supports my Government has provided for families include the Early Childcare Supplement and improved Maternity leave and Maternity benefit.  My own Department has put a range of support measures in place, including the Home School Community Liaison scheme, in recognition of the importance of supporting parents with their child-rearing responsibilities.</P>
        <P>In my decision to close the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, I took into account the successful fulfilment of the remit of the CECDE and the establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  This Office brings together policy makers from different Government Departments to ensure consistency in policy-making and policy implementation for children and is, I believe, better placed to deliver on the implementation of a National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education than a separate agency.  I certainly do not consider that the closure of the CECDE will adversely affect children&rsquo;s life chances.</P>
        <P>The annual cost to the exchequer of funding the CECDE is in the region of &euro;1 million.</P>
        <P>As the CECDE had effectively delivered on its remit, the implementation phase of the National Quality Framework will be led by a central Government Department. It is hoped that up to two contract posts will be established to progress quality provision in Early Childhood Education.</P>

	<P>On 29th September this year I announced details of 25 major school building projects which are to proceed to tender and construction.</P>
        <P>The school building projects which I announced will provide permanent primary school places for over 4,600 students in five new schools and 15 extended and modernised schools.</P>
        <P>A further 3,600 students at post-primary level will benefit from one new school and four major extension and refurbishment projects.</P>
        <P>This year, more than &euro;586 million will be spent in the school building programme, with one-third of that invested in rapidly developing areas. This has resulted in the delivery of 12,000 new school places in 2008 &mdash; a record number in any one year.

	<P>In 2007, my Department introduced the Special Education Needs Initiative (SENI) to address special educational needs and provide the necessary supports for learners in Youthreach centres.  The SENI involves a general allocation model similar to that introduced in the primary sector in September 2005. Its purpose is:</P><Col N="994"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To allow for a measured systematic development of professional practice in special education needs support in centres; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To introduce the practices of profiling and assessment into each centre, development of individual learning plans for each student, establishment of a mentoring support system and engagement in inter-agency work as required for each student.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It was introduced to 25 groups of 25 learners across 20 Youthreach centres. The Youthreach centre in Listowel is not one of these centres.</P>
        <P>The initiative has taken a whole centre approach and the needs of all learners are identified using a profiling model.  It is team based and caters mainly for students with high incidence needs. It provides for the allocation of increased staffing hours to deal with the special needs and disabilities of all the students.</P>
        <P>Additional training was provided to staff in the centres to enable the introduction, on a centre team basis, of a range of professional practices to support students with special educational needs/disabilities. This training followed on from the national introductory training programme introduced into all centres in 2006. In addition, the 20 centres have access to a password protected internet site containing guidelines, tailored training programmes and other materials.</P>
        <P>During 2007, an evaluation was carried out on the SENI to determine its suitability and effectiveness for the learners. The findings of this evaluation were generally positive and found the SENI to be meeting the needs of learners.</P>
        <P>Any consideration of the extension of the SENI will have to take account of the present and prospective economic and budgetary context and related financial constraints.</P>

	<P>The Inspectorate conducts whole-school evaluations in primary and post-primary schools.  During these evaluations, a range of subjects is examined, in addition to issues such as the quality of school management, school planning, teaching and learning, and supports for students.  The evaluation of teaching and learning focuses on a range of subjects which may vary from school to school.  Physical Education is included in the possible range of subjects that is evaluated.  In addition, at post-primary level, separate subject inspections of  Physical Education are carried out.  A number of WSE inspection reports at both primary and post-primary level in which Physical Education was reported upon may be viewed on the website of my Department, together with a number of  Subject Inspection reports on Physical Education in various post-primary schools. </P>

	<P>Many primary schools have a multi-purpose room which can be used for the purposes referred to by the Deputy.  With regard to outdoor seating, my Department&rsquo;s General Design Guidelines for Schools recommend that, in designing a new school, a variety of informal and social areas should be created to suit the learning development and cultural needs of pupils/students during breaks and before and after school.  In existing schools, it is open to the school authorities to prioritise expenditure from the school&rsquo;s minor capital works grant and use it to purchase furniture, if required.</P>
        <P>Grant-aid for Parents Rooms and Outdoor Play Facilities has also been made available to schools under the Educational Disadvantage category of the Dormant Accounts Fund and the RAPID Leverage Fund.  Eligibility for the scheme was restricted to primary and post primary schools participating in my Department&rsquo;s DEIS programme, schools in, or serving, RAPID areas and special schools.</P>
        <P>The scheme consists of four measures and a number of sub-measures.  The four measures are: Outdoor Play Facilities; Libraries; Parent Rooms; and Dining Areas.  Schools were allowed to submit prioritised proposals under each of the measures.  To date, a total of &euro;24.5 million has been made available to fund the scheme.</P>
        <P>In July 2007, proposals for 447 outdoor play facilities were assessed and approved, totalling &euro;6.25 million in grant-aid.  The majority of these projects are now complete and grant-aid has been paid to the schools.</P>
        <P>In June 2008, 118 parent room projects and 15 combined library and parent room projects were approved for a total of &euro;6.82 million in grant-aid.  These projects are due to be complete by 19 December 2008.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 467, 527 and 528 together.  </P>
        <P>The School Completion Programme encompasses both primary and post-primary levels and focuses on young people between the ages of 4 and 18 years and is designed to deal with issues of both concentrated and regionally dispersed disadvantage. SCP is a key component of DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which discriminates positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving.</P>
        <P>At present there are 124 projects, comprising 692 schools participating in the School Completion Programme.</P><Col N="999"/>
        <P>As Deputies are aware the Government announced on 8th July 2008 a series of public spending measures in response to the deterioration in the public finances.  In common with other Departments, my Department is required to reduce its payroll bill and that of its agencies by 3% by the end of 2009, through all appropriate measures identified by local management in the light of local  circumstances.  The exceptions to this requirement are certain frontline teaching staff and Special Needs Assistants.</P>
        <P>In the Department&rsquo;s letter of 21st August 2008, all SCP projects were advised that they have the authority to manage how the savings are to be achieved.  This is to facilitate projects in their efforts to ensure that these necessary steps will be applied in such a manner as to minimise their effect on young people targeted and to prioritise those activities which are found to be of most value  in supporting the young people concerned.</P>
        <P>In implementing this decision local Managers will have an opportunity to consider measures which might include the control of premium pay, the management of existing or future vacancies, the organisation of work processes and the levels at which work is carried out, as well as control of numbers through recruitment and other measures.  This requirement will not have a universal effect on all 124 projects, as projects vary in size, number of schools involved and the number and status of personnel employed and the types of interventions in place.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Government decision, the allocation for the pay element of the School Completion Programme in 2009 will be framed on the basis that a saving of 3% will be achieved when the pay bill is adjusted to include the full-year cost of Towards 2016 increases payable in 2008.  In line with the above, the 2008/09 allocation for SCP projects will be adjusted to reflect increases due under Towards 2016 in 2008 and a saving of 3% in payroll costs for 2009.  As this process is ongoing, there has been no effect to date on the services provided by any of the participating projects.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the savings requested, will lead to rationalisation, with more efficient and cost effective measures being implemented. In this way, it is not expected that there will be any significant diminution of front-line services.</P>

        <P>As of Thursday 2nd October, 2,279 teachers have been registered for probation in the 2008/2009 school year.  Of the 2,279 teachers, data in respect of the institution from which they obtained their teaching qualification is available in respect of 2,256 cases.</P>
        <P>There are 1,787 graduates from 8 Irish Colleges which run courses that are approved for the purpose of employment in primary schools.  A further 469 graduates obtained their teaching qualifications in a total of 84 colleges, almost all of which are located in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>All primary teachers who have trained outside of Ireland who have not satisfied the Irish language requirement must successfully complete all modules of the Scr&uacute;d&uacute; le haghaidh Cail&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge before they can commence their probation in primary schools in Ireland.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The intake into the Colleges of Education in future years will continue to be kept under review by my Department to ensure that there is an adequate supply of teachers.  In this regard, the Teaching Council&rsquo;s database of registered teachers will be able to provide a range of different information on the numbers of registered teachers in various disciplines and on their qualifications.  This information will provide valuable input into my Department&rsquo;s examination of issues around the supply and demand for teachers.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will see from the table my Department approved an additional 210 post graduate teacher training places for the 2008 intake bringing the total number of post graduate students in the four colleges who are studying to become primary teachers to 490.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, an on-line Graduate Diploma in Primary Education, accredited by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC), has been provided by Hibernia College since 2004.  This is a part time course and allows third level graduates to continue working while studying for their teaching qualification.  The Graduate Diploma conferred at the end of this  course, is recognised by my Department for the purposes of primary teaching.  It is estimated that there will be in the region of 500 graduates from the Hibernia College in 2008.</P>

	<P>On 1 September 2008 there were 110 primary and post-primary inspectors assigned to school evaluation activities including the conduct of whole-school evaluations.  There were 59 primary inspectors and 51 post-primary inspectors. </P>
        <P>At primary level whole-school evaluations can be conducted by individual inspectors or by teams of up to 4 inspectors, depending on the size of the school. In post-primary schools, whole-school evaluation teams generally range from 5 to 7 inspectors.  Because of the team approach <Col N="1002"/>to whole-school evaluation the number of evaluations an inspector may be scheduled to participate in normally ranges from 7 to 14 whole-school evaluations each year.</P>
        <P>A total of 300 whole-school evaluations were conducted during 2007.  These included 241 whole-school evaluations in primary schools and 59 post-primary whole-school evaluations.  These figures can be taken as representative of the average annual output for whole-school evaluations.</P>
        <P>During 2007, in addition to whole-school evaluations, primary inspectors conducted inspections in respect of more than 2,300 primary teachers on probation.  During the same period, post-primary inspectors conducted in the region of 550 stand-alone subject or programme inspections.  Inspectors, therefore, visit a significant proportion of the schools in the country each year in the context of their inspection work and this is beneficial in terms of engaging with school principals and teachers and providing advice.</P>

	<P>There are over 350 special classes for pupils with mild general learning difficulties in the primary school system.  I will arrange for the number of enrolled children to be sent to the Deputy when it has been compiled.</P>
        <P>Pupils with a mild general learning disability who are not enrolled in a special class are entitled to additional teaching support in school under the terms of the general allocation system for children with high incidence special needs.  One of the benefits of the general allocation system is that it has put support teaching resources in place in schools on a more systematic basis.  This  facilitates flexible and early intervention and gives schools more certainty about their resource levels.</P>

The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>
        <P>The school has not been designated as being in a rapidly developing area.  This school is not being considered in the context of the next round of public private partnership projects as the project is already at an advanced stage of architectural planning and involves an extension to an existing school rather than a new build.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has surveyed almost 900 primary schools across the country regarding their use of rented prefabricated accommodation and is in the process of compiling this information. The information gathered will be used to produce a database of information on rented prefabricated accommodation which will be maintained on an ongoing basis and will inform my Department&rsquo;s future decision-making in this area. This work is well advanced and I anticipate it will be completed shortly. When the information from the survey on rental of prefabricated accommodation is complete I will write to the Deputy with the relevant information.</P>
        <P>My Department provides grant-aid towards the provision of temporary school accommodation to the management authorities of education providers where it is established that a need for such temporary accommodation exists.</P>
        <P>My Department has undertaken an assessment of the rental of temporary accommodation with a view to identifying the point at which purchase of such accommodation provides better value for money than rental. As a result of this assessment, my Department now has a policy of purchasing temporary accommodation where the need for this is likely to last for more than three  years.</P>
        <P>The Permanent Accommodation Scheme was introduced in 2003 to reduce the need for prefabs. It was designed to give value for money in terms of providing permanent accommodation in place of prefabs, where an accommodation need was likely to exist for a considerable length of time. Since its introduction, over &euro;100 million has been allocated to schools under the scheme and it has resulted in the provision of an additional 625 classrooms and 275 resource rooms in schools around the country. This is in addition to those classrooms provided under the major capital projects managed by my Department.</P>
        <P>Had the Permanent Accommodation Scheme not been in place, a very significant proportion of those classrooms and resource rooms would have had to be provided using temporary accommodation such as prefabricated classrooms.</P><Col N="1005"/>
        <P>In July of this year I introduced a further innovation which allows those schools with an urgent and pressing need for additional accommodation and who are being given approval for grant-aid to avail of the option of using their grants to purchase prefabs or to construct permanent classrooms for the same amount.</P>
        <P>Despite this, it will continue to be necessary for prefabricated accommodation to be provided because competing priorities mean that it will not always be possible to have a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short time-frame. My Department will continue to provide funding for such prefabricated accommodation and the decision on whether to rent or purchase will depend on the likely length of time it will be required. In all cases, the approach will be to ensure best value for money.</P>

        <Quest> if the area of computation in maths has been considered by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment or by his Department in terms of helping students to manage maths as a subject within the primary and secondary curriculum; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[33594/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The term &lsquo;computation&rsquo; has a variety of different meanings, ranging from a simple process of (number) calculation or reckoning, to very sophisticated algorithms or protocols that occur within closed physical systems, such as computers.</P>
        <P>In respect of school students and their learning in mathematics, computation in terms of number operations is included at both primary and second level, and is accompanied by estimation, by means of which the reasonableness of the outcome of a calculation can be judged. This is particularly important where the use of a calculator is intended for all or part of the process, so that students have a means of checking their answers. Apart from initial learning and practice of the number operations themselves, which typically would form an introduction to the study of &lsquo;number&rsquo;, their use arises frequently in other areas of mathematics and thus the students&rsquo; computation skills are reinforced. Development of good computation skills is seen as essential for successful study of later topics in mathematics at all levels.</P>
        <P>Applications of computation in post-primary mathematics which involve formulae/algorithms arise, for example, in topics within &lsquo;applied arithmetic and measure&rsquo; such as mensuration (involving calculation of area of shapes, etc.), or when determining the compound interest <Col N="1006"/>gained by investing a sum of money at a given rate of interest over a stated period of time. Similarly, topics such as sequences and series involve establishing and/or using a relationship which describes the pattern of numbers in a given situation/problem to compute specific elements of the sequence or series.</P>
        <P>Appropriate use of the calculator or computer also features in both primary and post-primary mathematics. This technology itself depends on algorithms and routines for computing the results of frequently very complex mathematical problems, and its use greatly enables the student to focus on the mathematics involved rather than on the tedious task of processing the numbers with accuracy.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Computation&rdquo; is included in the current Junior Certificate Mathematics Syllabus as part of the Arithmetic strand of Mathematics. This is part of strand 3 of the revision of syllabuses taking place as part of &ldquo;Project Maths&rdquo;. Work has begun to revise strand three currently at course committee level and will be completed before the end of the current school year. At that stage a draft strand 3 syllabus will be introduced in the 24 pilot schools. The syllabus will be introduced in all schools from Sept 2011.</P>

	<P>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, including organising the holding of examinations and issuing the results of examinations.</P>
        <P>In the State examinations all candidates who attempt an examination in a particular subject are awarded a grade ranging from an A (85% and above) to an NG (less than 10%). In the Leaving Certificate, the A grade is sub-divided into an A1 and A2. Irrespective of the grade obtained, all candidates receive a certificate that records all their grades and no candidate is deemed to have failed any examination.</P>
        <P>Statistics in relation to percentage breakdown of candidates by grade awarded in each subject from 2006 to 2008 are available on the State Examinations website &mdash; www.examinations.ie</P>
        <P>A major programme of reform in Mathematics is now under way at Junior and Leaving Certificate Level, which is designed to improve understanding in Mathematics.</P>
        <P>The main features of Project Maths reforms are designed to</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Provide a bridging framework from the revised primary curriculum into  second level</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Promote greater maths literacy across the school population</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Bring changed emphasis in the mathematics learnt and, in particular, a strong focus on context and applications and problem solving in a general move towards a strengthened emphasis on &ldquo;real mathematics education&rdquo; and a greater ICT dimension</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Encourage greater take up at higher level</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Provide a solid foundation which prepares students for careers in science, technology, engineering, business or humanities options</P><Col N="1007"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Provide for an innovative professional development model under which change would be implemented in various areas of maths on a phased basis in a rolling programme of reform. Lesson plans and exemplars would be developed and piloted in schools, then go on a national website and the examination system in that area would change at that stage</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">For schools involved in the initial implementation from September 2008, students will experience mathematics in a new way. Teachers will be provided with classroom materials to enable them to adopt the new approaches and will be supported professionally in embracing change. These materials and supports will include lesson plans, with teacher guides and student worksheets, on-line exemplars and a range of assessment materials.  Examination questions will also be changed for these students.</P>
        <P>The changes will be phased over 3 years, initially in the project schools, beginning in September 2008.  In mainstream schools, the changes will begin in September 2010, preceded by professional development for teachers the previous year.</P>

	<P>Enrolment decisions are the responsibility of the Board of Management of each individual school. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. In these circumstances, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision. Where the school is established or maintained by a VEC an appeal shall lie in the first instance to the VEC and thereafter to the Secretary General of my Department. It is only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld that the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol or re-instate a pupil.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy is detailed in the following table.  It breaks down appeals to the Secretary General by year and between the Primary and Post Primary sectors.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the NEPS or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that NEPS service to Co. Mayo schools is provided, in the main, through its office in Castlebar.  In the last academic year four NEPS psychologists were accommodated therein and coverage was provided to 71% of Mayo schools representing some 85% of the counties&rsquo; pupils.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I can also inform the Deputy that an additional psychologist is to be employed in the Castlebar office before the end of 2008 which result in a further increase in NEPS coverage of schools in the county. A sixth posting for Castlebar, bringing the office up to its full planned complement, is under consideration. The timing of such an appointment will be decided in the context of the finalisation of my Department&rsquo;s 2009 Estimates allocation.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to increase the level of the capitation grant for primary and secondary schools; if his attention has been drawn to the inadequacy of the grant in meeting day to day expenditure; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The scope for any increases in the capitation grant for primary or post-primary schools has to be considered in the context of Government budgetary policy and the overall economic climate.</P>
        <P>My Department is aware of the funding pressures on schools. However, progress has been made in recent years that has seen the primary school capitation grant increased from &euro;81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of &euro;178.58. This represents an increase of almost 120% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000. The compares to a cumulative increase in the Consumer Price Index between 2000 and the end of 2007 of about 30%.</P>
        <P>In 2008 alone the Department has paid around &euro;167m to primary schools to meet their day to day running costs. The improvements mean that the combined day-to-day funding for primary schools has increased by &euro;21 to &euro;330 per pupil.  As a result, a primary school with 300 pupils will receive almost &euro;100,000 to meet their running costs.</P>
        <P>Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from &euro;457 to &euro;880 per pupil &mdash; an increase of 42% from the rate in 2006.  The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2008, the standard per capita grant was increased by &euro;15 per pupil and now amounts to &euro;331 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of &euro;15 per pupil in 2008 in the support services grant bringing that  grant to &euro;204 per pupil.</P>
        <P>The cumulative increase of &euro;30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to &euro;535 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;300,000.</P>
        <P>Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector along with those in the VEC sector are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.</P>
        <P>These significant increases in funding are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

	<P>The provision of school meals is primarily funded by the School Meals Programme, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, and involving both an urban scheme operated by local authorities and a local projects scheme.</P>
        <P>The School Meals Programme aims to supplement the nutritional intake of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds in order to allow them to fulfil their potential within the educational system and also to reduce the risk of early school leaving. Breakfast clubs provide a caring and supportive environment where young people can engage with their peers and discuss things in a social setting. This also provides an opportunity to prepare for the school day. Parents are also encouraged to become involved in running breakfast clubs, many of which are also supported by charitable agencies which bring with them expertise such as family support.</P>
        <P>The majority of the 124 projects currently participating in the School Completion Programme operate breakfast clubs or other meal provision, in accordance with the Nutritional Guidelines issued by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>My Department has also been working in close co-operation with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to ensure that the resources available for school meals are used to best effect and to further expand school meals provision in schools serving disadvantaged communities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 505 to 517, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002. In considering the need to provide extra resource and other teachers to schools in recent years, the Government could have decided to make children wait until permanent accommodation could be provided. However, we prioritised putting the extra teachers into schools as soon as possible and, in some cases, this has involved the provision of high-quality steel-framed prefabricated structures to accommodate them.</P>
        <P>In general, my Department approves the purchase or rental of prefabricated classrooms based on need at the time of application. Local school managements then organise their class numbers, year on year, to achieve the optimum local efficiencies. My Department does not hold information on the numbers of pupils in individual schools who currently occupy temporary accommodation. It is not possible therefore, to provide the details based on pupil numbers requested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>My Department examines all applications for additional accommodation on an individual basis to determine if the need exists in the first instance. However, while comprehensive information on the provision of temporary accommodation is held on individual school files, my Department does not have a central database of those schools that are currently fully or partially accommodated in temporary or prefabricated accommodation.</P>
        <P>My Department has surveyed almost 900 primary schools across the country regarding their use of rented prefabricated accommodation and is in the process of compiling this information. The information gathered will be used to produce a database of information on rented prefabricated accommodation which will be maintained on an ongoing basis and will inform my Department&rsquo;s future decision-making in this area. This work is well advanced and I anticipate it will be completed shortly.</P>
        <P>With regard to repairs where temporary accommodation is rented, it would generally be the responsibility of the contractor to effect such repairs as are necessary from time to time. Where temporary accommodation has been purchased and is in need of repair or replacement, my Department would deal with such applications from schools on an individual basis as the need arises. This information is not held in a readily accessible aggregate form for the areas requested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The Permanent Accommodation Scheme was introduced in 2003 to reduce the need for prefabs. It was designed to give value for money in terms of providing permanent accommodation in place of prefabs, where an accommodation need was likely to exist for a consider<Col N="1017"/>able length of time. Since its introduction, over &euro;100m has been allocated to schools under the scheme and it has resulted in the provision of an additional 625 classrooms and 275 resource rooms in schools around the country. This is in addition to those classrooms provided under the major capital projects managed by my Department.  Had the Permanent Accommodation Scheme not been in place, a very significant proportion of those classrooms and resource rooms would have had to be provided using temporary accommodation such as prefabricated classrooms.</P>
        <P>In July of this year I introduced a further innovation which allows those schools with an urgent and pressing need for additional accommodation and who are being given approval for grant-aid to avail of the option of using their grants to purchase prefabs or to construct permanent classrooms for the same amount.</P>
        <P>With regard to the progression of individual school building projects, the Deputy will be aware that the commencement and progression of all large scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is under consideration in the context of my Department&rsquo;s Multi-Annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Government introduced a multi-annual Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF) for  higher education in 2006 with an allocation of &euro;510 million over the period of  the National Development Plan. The Fund is intended to be a major catalyst in  bringing about substantial change and quality improvement in our higher  education institutions and promoting system-wide collaboration that draws on  all institutions&rsquo; collective strengths.</P>
        <P>Projects approved under the Fund are aimed at institutional reform, enhancing  teaching and learning, improving access and life long learning and enabling the  development of fourth level activity. It is estimated that payments under the  Fund to institutions by the end of this year will amount to some &euro;30 million.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 522 and 523 together.</P>
        <P>The scope for any increases in the capitation grant for primary schools has to  be considered in the context of Government budgetary policy and the overall  economic climate.</P><Col N="1019"/>
        <P>My Department is aware of the funding pressures on schools. However, it is  important to recognise that progress has been made in recent years that has  seen the primary school capitation grant increased from &euro;81.26 per pupil in  2000 to its current rate of &euro;178.58. This represents an increase of almost 120%  in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000. The compares to a  cumulative increase in the Consumer Price Index between 2000 and the end of  2007 of about 30%.</P>
        <P>In 2008 alone the Department has paid around &euro;167m to primary schools to meet their day to day running costs. The improvements mean that the combined  day-to-day funding for primary schools has increased by &euro;21 to &euro;330 per pupil.  As a result, a primary school with 300 pupils will receive almost &euro;100,000 to  meet their running costs.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of  children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special  classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from &euro;457 to  &euro;880 per pupil &mdash; an increase of 42% from the rate in 2006.</P>
        <P>I am committed to increasing the funding for primary schools as resources  permit.</P>

	<P>For young parents of school-going age, the most pressing issues are considered to be a sensitive response to their needs, appropriate counselling/mentoring and medical assistance, minimal disruption of tuition, and appropriate access to childcare. </P>
        <P>Individual circumstances will differ and accordingly, school management practice will vary from case to case. Generally, when it comes to the attention of the school that a pupil is pregnant, the school authorities check to ensure that the girl is receiving appropriate medical assistance and counselling advice. Schools endeavour to be sensitive and understanding to the girl&rsquo;s needs while trying to ensure that her education is not neglected.</P>
        <P>Home tuition is provided to pregnant schoolgirls who are absent from school during the later stages of pregnancy or immediately following the birth of a baby when attendance may be impractical. In 2006/07, home tuition was approved for 69 pregnant girls attending post primary schools, while in 2007/08 home tuition was approved for 79 pregnant girls attending post primary schools.</P>
        <P>Funding has been committed in 2008 for the education element of 8 Teenage Parenting Support projects as a specific gender element of the School Completion Programme under DEIS in preventing early school leaving among teenage mothers. Approximately, 1000 young parents are targeted by the Teen Parenting Support Programme (TPSP).</P>
        <P>Links have been established between local School Completion projects and these 8 Projects, assisted by the SCP National Coordination Team and the Teenage Parenting Support Initiative Coordinators. The aim of these projects is to enable young women who are pregnant and young mothers to stay in second level education and to progress on to third level education or training. The Project does this by providing individual support, information and grinds where necessary. Young people participating in Teen Parenting Support Programmes are targeted in-school, out-<Col N="1020"/>of-school and in higher /further education, giving them the opportunity to reach their full potential through continued participation in education and training. This will improve their life opportunities and reduce the likelihood of the young family experiencing poverty and social exclusion and being long-term dependants on state support.</P>
        <P>My Department has no plans at present to introduce a stay-in-school payment scheme for teenage parents.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the Rules for National Schools, the length of the school day for pupils enrolled in infants or first class may, at the Board of Management&rsquo;s discretion, be reduced by one hour to 4 hours and 40 minutes. </P>
        <P>It is acknowledged that particular circumstances may arise whereby the implementation of the shorter day for these pupils can cause difficulties for some parents. Where this arises, my Department would encourage school authorities to engage with parents locally with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable resolution.  I do not propose to intercede in the case referred to by the Deputy as such matters are best dealt with at a local level.</P>

        <Quest> the sum of money budgeted by his Department for the 2008 fiscal year towards the operation of, including awards made by or arising from decisions of, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse; the budgetary requirements he expects the Commission to require in 2009 and beyond; the details of its work and purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was established on a statutory basis in May 2000 pursuant to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000.  </P>
        <P>The broad terms of reference of the Commission are: to afford victims of abuse in childhood an opportunity to tell of the abuse they suffered to a sympathetic and experienced forum; to establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of the physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and in other places during the period from 1940 to the present; and to compile a report and publish it to the general public, on the activities and the findings of the Commission, containing recommendations on actions to address the continuing effects of the abuse and actions to be taken to safeguard children from abuse in the future.</P>
        <P>It is not, however, the function of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse to make awards to person who may have been abused whilst resident in institutions.  This is the function of the Residential Institutions Redress Board or indeed the Courts, depending on the route taken by the former resident.</P>
        <P>At this particular point in time, it is estimated that an additional provision in the region of &euro;45 to &euro;55 million may be required to meet the remaining overall costs of the Commission.  The 2008 allocation of &euro;18.1 million will meet part of this liability.  This should, however, be <Col N="1021"/>considered to be a tentative provision given that the Commission has yet to receive and assess a large volume of third party legal costs.  Consequently, it is difficult to estimate the final outcome of costs at this time.</P>

	<P>I understand that the child referred to by the Deputy is enrolled in a special class for pupils with speech and language disorder. Such classes operate at a  pupil teacher ratio of 7:1.  In view of this significant support, additional  individual resource hours are not provided.  An enhanced capitation grant is  paid in respect of each pupil enrolled in these classes. The Health Service  Executive funds the provision of speech and language therapy services for the  children attending these classes. </P>

	<P>The development of a building project for the school in question is at an early stage, and will require a technical inspection before a final schedule of accommodation can be agreed.   My Department wrote to the Chief Executive Officer of Co Clare VEC in July of this year informing him that it is not in a position to organise a technical inspection of the school at this time due to demands for higher priority projects.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.   However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the further progression of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>Bus &Eacute;ireann operates the school transport service on behalf of my Department. Routes are planned in such a way to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible pupils have a reasonable standard of service with regard to pick-up points and travel and waiting times, while at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient and cost effective manner. </P>
        <P>My Department has been advised by Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Transport Liaison Officer for Co. Galway that the combined travel and waiting times for the pupils referred to by the Deputy remain within the general guidelines of the School Transport Scheme.</P>
