      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Office of the Information Commissioner received 10,704 requests in 2007, a decrease of 42%, or 7,739, on 2003.  The reason given was the introduction of fees. The Information Commissioner has requested on a number of occasions that the scale and structure of fees be reviewed.  The reason for this is obvious.  The commissioner makes that point that among eight comparable jurisdictions Ireland is one of only two that charges for freedom of information appeals.  For example, Ontario charges &euro;16 in comparison with Ireland which charges &euro;150 in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, dismissed a claim by the Information Commissioner, Ms O&rsquo;Reilly, for a reduction in fees for freedom of information requests and appeals which led in her opinion to a culture of secrecy.  Is the Taoiseach, in his new capacity, prepared to reconsider the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations and suggestions in so far as they apply to his Department and others?  Also, does he consider that when an appeal is lodged and justified the fee charged by the State should be waived?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Ceann Comhairle has pointed out on previous occasions, the Minister for Finance bears responsibility for the Freedom of Information Acts.  I am answering in respect of the operation of the Acts in my Department.  Regarding Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s more general question in regard to fees, there is no charge for personal information.  The up-front fee is &euro;15 and the internal review fee is &euro;75.  A review by the Information Commission costs &euro;150, with reduced fees for persons on limited means.  </P>
        <P>The regulation allows for a refund in the case of a request being withdrawn.  In response to criticisms on the introduction of fees, it is argued that any decline in the number of requests that can be attributed to such a modest fee would fully vindicate the Minister&rsquo;s view that a  better balance needed to be struck and that fees would result in a greater appreciation of the service and more considered and responsible use of the Act.  The level of fees has not been increased since introduced in July 2003.  In my opinion, this rebalancing was necessary to ensure the Act is used as envisaged.  The fact that fees are being charged, other than for personal information for which there is no fee, ensures that people when requesting information are judicious in the trawl and the work they ask of the service in the provision of that information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Where a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act is disallowed and is subsequently successful following an appeal to the Information Commissioner the fees should be refunded.  I have two further questions for the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service met with the Information Commissioner to assess the impact of fees on the Freedom of Information Act.  The Taoiseach will recall the report in this regard.  The committee subsequently wrote to the Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, seeking to have the matter addressed as urgently as possible and to have legislation introduced at the first available opportunity.  Nothing happened in this regard during the remainder of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s tenure as Minister for Finance or since his successor was appointed.  Will the Government consider this formal request from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service for the introduction of legis<Col N="275"/>lation arising from its analysis with the Information Commission of the fees&rsquo; impact on the Freedom of Information Act?</P>
        <P>A number of bodies remain outside the freedom of information remit.  The Information Commissioner has stated there is no reason the Central Applications Office, the Adoption Board, the State Claims Agency, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority should remain outside the remit of the Freedom of Information Acts.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also mentioned in this regard.  I recognise some of those bodies would clearly have sensitive information that could well be outside the remit of a normal request under freedom of information.  Does the Taoiseach share the view of the Information Commissioner that some of those should also be included, at least in part, under the Freedom of Information Act and the kind of information which would be of use to the public, without being State-sensitive or whatever, should be included under the Act?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>In truth, these are matters for the Minister for Finance unless the Taoiseach wants to be of assistance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the difficulty.  I have information specifically relating to my Department, but the general policy issues regarding a possible extension, revision of fees or amending legislation as a result of reports from various Oireachtas committees or from the Information Commissioner, who, in her annual report, sets out her views, are a matter for Government and the Oireachtas to decide.  Recommendations, by their very nature, are not mandatory.</P>
        <P>I am not in a position to provide information on the general wider policy issue, except to make an observation.  During my time as Minister for Finance, if I am not incorrect in saying so, we made some decisions to considerably broaden the number of organisations coming under the freedom of information legislation.  That was a result of a review which was brought to our attention and which provided for many of them.  Over time, there has been a steady extension of the bodies to which the Freedom of Information Act applies.  That happened during my tenure, as I am sure it happened during the tenure of predecessors in the office since the Freedom of Information Act was enacted.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of appeals investigated by the Information Commissioner, in respect of my Department since the introduction of the Freedom of Information Act in April 1998, a total of 23 requests, or less than 2%, have been investigated by the Information Commissioner.  Of these, a decision not to release records was upheld in five, a decision to part release records was made in four cases, a decision to release records in full was made in three cases and the applications were withdrawn in ten cases.  There is one case currently under investigation by the Information Commissioner.</P>
        <P>In respect of the previous query on the fees issue, an appeal to the Information Commissioner is a quasi-judicial process that can require many months to complete and can entail a considerable amount of work.  The cost is &euro;75 for an internal fee and &euro;150 for an appeal to the Information Commissioner.  Those fees are a fair reflection of the nature of the appeals process and of the costs and time involved.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that a person who appeals to the commissioner may receive a preliminary decision which gives a good indication of the likely final decision.  Even at that late stage in the process, the requester can withdraw the appeal and obtain a full refund of fees.  I understand that 30% of appeals made to the Office of the Information Commissioner are withdrawn in that respect.</P><Col N="276"/>
        <P>The question of the extension of the Freedom of Information Act to public bodies is, as I stated, an ongoing process undertaken by the Department of Finance.  In 2006 we saw the biggest ever extension of the Act, when it was extended to a further 137 bodies, which means there are over 520 bodies now covered by FOI compared with 67 when the Act first came into operation ten years ago.  Arrangements are under way in the Department of Finance to prepare for the extension of FOI to a further group of bodies, including the Law Reform Commission, the last remaining body under the aegis of my Department to be included.  I expect the Minister for Finance will have an announcement to make in this regard in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about a particular decision made by the Information Commissioner on 10 October last dealing with a Cabinet document relating to the Cabinet&rsquo;s consideration of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.  It decided the document should be released under the Freedom of Information Act and that European access to environmental information regulations superseded our domestic laws and practices that Cabinet documents are covered by Cabinet confidentiality and not released.</P>
        <P>In respect of that decision, has the document concerned been released to the applicant or is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to release the document?  Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to appeal the decision made by the Information Commissioner?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Unless the Taoiseach can be of assistance, this is far beyond the ambit of these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I can be of some assistance.  The Deputy is referring to a recent ruling by the Information Commissioner regarding environmental information that ordered a release of a record disclosing Cabinet discussions.  Following consultations with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, it has been decided that an appeal should be taken in that case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision by the Information Commissioner that a Cabinet document should be released is highly significant.  On what basis will the Government appeal the decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Information Commissioner found that the directive on public access to environmental information does not contain any provisions that enable Cabinet discussion on emissions into the environment to remain confidential.  In her view, the regulations that transpose the directive, as well as the provisions in the Constitution in respect of Cabinet confidentiality, conflict with the directive.  In these circumstances, she considers that the directive&rsquo;s provisions should have direct effect.</P>
        <P>We have been directed to release our record, which contains details of discussions at a Cabinet meeting on emissions into the environment.  The appeal is being considered as a result of advice from the Attorney General.  In our opinion and that of the Attorney General, this is a matter for the courts on which to make a decision, rather than a holder of a statutory office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>How many of the recommendations in the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s report of March 2007 have been accepted by the Government?  Has it accepted any recommendations to improve the working of the freedom of information process?  For example, the Taoiseach spoke about appeals and the cost of same.  Has he given consideration to refunding the cost of those appeals against any public body which have been upheld by the Information Commissioner?  Is the Taoiseach aware that the enforcement records of the Health and Safety Authority were removed from the scope of the Act in 2005?  One of the Information <Col N="277"/>Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendations was that this should be restored.  The Taoiseach should indicate the number of measures she has commended that have been adopted by the Government, as well as commenting on the two specific issues.</P>
        <P>I understand the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department has oversight responsibility in respect of the working of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which was established at the end of last year by the former Taoiseach.  A recent freedom of information request was made requesting information on international travel by members of the aforementioned committee members.  While I do not know whether it was made directly to the Department of the Taoiseach, it certainly is the establishing Department of the committee.  I understand that this request applied to all Members of the D&aacute;il.  In this Deputy&rsquo;s case, I noted the freedom of information request referred to international travel and was specific to air and sea travel.  However, after 11 years as a D&aacute;il Deputy, the only return from me as a member of that committee was in respect of travel to attend the Good Friday Agreement anniversary conference in Belfast earlier this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is imparting information, rather than seeking it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Such travel was returned as being international travel in that specific freedom of information request.  The Taoiseach should examine that practice.  I do not consider travel between here and Belfast to constitute international travel and I do not think the Taoiseach does either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will check into the last point made by the Deputy.  I do not think that Tyrone playing Kerry was an international match either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree fully.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It certainly was not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The wider general policy questions raised by the Deputy are best directed to the Minister for Finance, who has oversight responsibility.  I replied earlier to the Leader of the Opposition on the question of fees where a successful appeal is made to the Information Commissioner.  Rather than restating my reply, an appeal to the Information Commissioner is a quasi-judicial process.  I am unsure whether Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was in the House when I gave my reply to Deputy Kenny but it is on the record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am specifically interested in whether fees will be refunded where the appeal is upheld by the Information Commissioner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My earlier response was that it is important to note that a person who appeals to the commissioner may receive a preliminary decision which gives a good indication of the likely final decision.  Even at that late stage in the process, the requester can withdraw the appeal and obtain a full refund of fees.  That option is used in 30% of cases as a means of getting a refund prior to receiving a final decision.</P>
        <P>It is correct to say that there is not an explicit right to the return of fees if a matter is left with the Information Commissioner and the final appeal is successful.  There is an intermediate stage when, having received the preliminary decision, one can then apply for the withdrawal of the fee before the final decision is made.  The preliminary decision usually gives a good indication of the likely final decision.  The preliminary decision process provides an opportunity for people to have the fees returned rather than waiting for the appeal to be formally declared successful or otherwise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Government and the social partners recently finalised the formal review of Towards 2016 as provided for under the agreement.  This report has now been published and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Copies have also been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Given that the terms of the pay agreement for the private sector expired from March, the review process included negotiations on a new pay round.</P>
        <P>The agenda for the talks was broad in scope and complex in terms of the specific issues up for discussion.  Grappling with this extensive and complex agenda required many hours to be set aside for negotiations.  Following a lengthy talks process, in the early hours of the morning on Saturday, 2 August the social partners agreed to adjourn their discussions on a new pay agreement.  Contacts at official level continued over the summer with a view to establishing whether the potential existed to conclude an agreement.</P>
        <P>On Friday, 5 September, I held a series of discussions with the social partners during which I underlined the changed context in which the pay talks were taking place in terms of the evolving economic situation.  The parties affirmed to me their commitment to engaging in further discussions aimed at establishing if an agreement on a new pay deal would be possible.</P>
        <P>An intensive round of negotiations resumed on Monday, 8 September, within a tight deadline.  Throughout this process I monitored developments closely and in the course of the final overnight session of negotiations I held a series of meetings with the parties with a view to facilitating a meeting of minds on the key issues on the agenda.  As Deputies will be aware, negotiations reached a successful conclusion on the morning of Wednesday, 17 September, when an agreement was reached on a successor to the first module of Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>The agreement provides for pay increases to be paid to workers over a period of 21 months, with pay pauses of three months and 11 months agreed for the private and public sectors, respectively.  The agreement reached between the parties also covers a range of non-pay and <Col N="279"/>employment law related initiatives, including those related to agency workers, employee representation and victimisation, pensions, procurement, managing change and innovation, upskilling and public sector modernisation.</P>
        <P>There is consensus among the social partners that the pay agreement provides an important transitional framework for meeting the economic and social challenges which Ireland currently faces.  Indeed, the proposals have been widely recognised as representing the best terms that could be achieved.  The pay agreement also provides a welcome boost for investors and workers alike by providing certainty in pay determination, safeguarding employment and helping to preserve the industrial peace which has been a hallmark of social partnership and which has benefited our economy significantly over the last 21 years.  The terms of the draft agreement are now being considered by the social partners with a view to ratification over the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In parallel to the pay negotiations, the Government and social partners reviewed progress under the wider economic and social provisions of Towards 2016.  To inform the review, a detailed progress report was prepared on progress since the commencement of the agreement under each commitment.  Each social partner pillar was also invited to make its own submission with its assessment of progress during the first phase of the agreement and these provided the basis for discussion.</P>
        <P>Social partnership is a responsive and evolving process, an important aspect of which is ensuring wide and appropriate involvement.  During the negotiations, the interests of taxpayers and consumers are represented by the Government.  The Government and the social partners have agreed an assessment of progress over the first two and a half years of Towards 2016 and the economic challenges facing the country in the short and medium term.  Using this shared understanding, the Government and the social partners intend to work together through the current period of economic transition and uncertainty to ensure that the vision and goals set down in Towards 2016 can still be achieved.</P>
        <P>They have accepted that economic conditions require a re-prioritisation of public expenditure while recognising the need to seek to protect the most vulnerable.  They have also identified a small number of priority issues on which they will work together as social partners over the next phase of the agreement.  Social partnership has served us well in the past and, by reaching agreement at this point of economic difficulty, the process has demonstrated a capacity to contribute to managing more challenging times.</P>
        <P>I met with representatives of ICTU last Friday.  They conveyed to me their concern that the effect of the income levy announced in the budget, the overall progressive effect of which they welcomed, could be seen as being at odds with one of the important features of the draft pay agreement, namely, its focus on those on low incomes.  While the Government believes that it is not unreasonable that everyone should make a contribution, however modest, in accordance with their income in these difficult times, it is prepared, in the context of the importance we attach to social partnership and to the draft agreement, to provide in the Finance Bill that the levy will not apply to incomes up to the level of the national minimum wage.</P>
        <P>The National Implementation Body, NIB, which has been in existence since the start of 2001, continues to meet as necessary to oversee delivery of the industrial peace and stability provisions of Towards 2016.  The NIB has met on a number of occasions recently to assist in the resolution of industrial disputes.  Over the past six months, the NIB has considered such issues as the implementation of the 37.5 hour working week for nurses, the extension of flexi-bands in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, pensions issues at RT&Eacute; and the introduction of an incident command system in the fire services.  Meetings of the NIB also provide opportunities for informal discussions on some broader issues relating to the social partnership process and the industrial relations climate generally.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I did not welcome the introduction of what is known as the Lenihan levy but I appreciate the statement made by the Taoiseach that this will not apply to those earning up to minimum wage.  What numbers are excluded as a consequence and at what level will the minimum wage be next year?  As a result of the changes, how does the Government propose to make up for the savings it had budgeted for when the levy applied to those on the minimum wage and will there be changes at the upper level?</P>
        <P>In view of the rapidly deteriorating state of the public finances, is it the view of the Taoiseach that the public sector pay increases negotiated can be paid next year?</P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the first question, it is out of our respect for and in view of the importance of assisting the social partnership process that the Government is indicating that it is prepared to provide that the levy will not apply to incomes up to the level of the national minimum wage.  I do not have the figures in front of me but approximately 850,000 workers are outside the tax net, some 36% of the workforce.  In the context of the Finance Bill, the Minister for Finance will be ensuring that revenue is in line with the contribution this would make towards the social partnership process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Social partnership, which has been hanging by a thread, was weakened considerably to the point that ICTU stated last week that the agreement would not be passed if the Taoiseach persisted with the Lenihan levy in the form in which it was proposed.  Is it not obvious that the Budget Statement has now become a discussion document?  It is negotiable at all turns.  On this issue, because of the fear of the collapse of social partnership, the Cabinet decided this morning that the Lenihan levy would not apply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Just slightly longer than the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet decided the levy of the Minister for Finance should not apply to those below the minimum wage.  Obviously, that is one issue that has been negotiated.  Controversy arose from the fiasco of the withdrawal of the automatic right to medical cards for those aged over 70.  That was another issue decided upon by the Government.   Now it clearly sees the folly of its ways and the decision is being changed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the position of the Government regarding public service reform?  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, has suggested that the taxpayer might now be employed to remove from the public service persons whom the Government says should not have been employed in the first place.  With regard to the Health Service Executive, Professor Drumm says there will be 1,000 persons removed from that section of the public service.  What is the situation?  Will it apply only to the HSE or will it apply to the public sector in general?  What is the extent of borrowing required to deal with the matter and how will it be targeted?  From his experience, the Taoiseach is well aware that, as in previous times, persons at the higher levels may well leave, creating a very serious problem.  What is the position regarding public sector reform and regarding performance as it relates to pay?  What is the story from Government in respect of a targeted redundancy scheme and how much will borrowing for that cost?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny raised a number of matters.  First, the Minister for Finance outlined in the Budget Statement his intention to move on public sector reform.  As I said, there is a task force which will provide the implementation plan in coming weeks.  This will implement and sequence the OECD report on reform of the public service and how to integrate public services in order that we can improve those services.  The plan will improve opportunities for those who work in our public services to provide an integrated, co-ordinated and citizen-centred approach.  It will seek to ensure that the very considerable resources provided by taxpayers are used to the best possible effect in terms of the administrative structures we devise and that there is ability to move beyond departmental and agency boundaries and to work in a co-ordinated fashion to get the best possible output for taxpayers.</P>
        <P>Second, on the response I gave Deputy Kenny about the public service, the pay increase and how we will deal with that issue, the draft pay agreement provides for a pay pause of 11 months in the case of the public service, which is a very significant saving.  The Government has decided that special provision will not be made for the cost of that increase in the Estimates for 2009.  In other words, the cost must be found within the existing allocations for Departments and agencies which already reflected a 3% reduction in payroll costs for 2009 over 2008 outturn levels.  The net effect is a reduction of 4%, which will require significant restructuring and productivity gains.  The framework by which this will be achieved, including a comprehensive review of staffing levels and deployment of personnel, will be announced by the Minister for Finance and me in a major package of public service reform measures in coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Regarding the budget, this contribution will ensure that social partnership continues to be a part of the operation of Government.  Our commitment to social partnership is an effort on our part to ensure that we get a good outcome.  Deputy Kenny described the budget as a discussion document.  The budget will be implemented and the deficits in the macro-economic indicators that we set ourselves are those to which we will work during the coming year.  The Fine Gael Party finance spokesman put forward an alternative budget which seeks a deficit of 5.5% without tax increases.  That would require a further &euro;4 billion in expenditure cuts in either the capital programme or in current expenditure.  That is a non-discussion document.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Aer Lingus, the former national airline which the Government privatised, has effectively torn up all notions of social partnership by indicating recently that some 1,500 workers will be let go and their work outsourced through <Col N="282"/>agencies?  The company proposes to bring in workers at what can only be described as yellow pack pay and conditions.  Does the Taoiseach agree this is an outrage?  Did he note that one of the workers involved stated the measures would tear out the heart and soul of the company and that we were witnessing Irish Ferries mark two?  What steps will he take to have this disgraceful situation stopped?  Surely the future of the economy will not be a continual trend of long held and hard won pay and conditions for Irish workers being frittered away by people whose motive is clearly suspect.</P>
        <P>I listened to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments on the income levy measures announced in last week&rsquo;s budget.  He will have noted the decision in the new partnership agreement to compensate low paid workers with an extra 0.5% on their meagre wages.  This further compensation measure would amount to no more than 5 cent for somebody earning as little as &euro;10 per hour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is imparting information instead of seeking it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am seeking information on social partnership.  How, in heaven&rsquo;s name, can the Taoiseach stand over the proposal in last week&rsquo;s budget to impose a 1% levy on all workers, having given to the lowest paid workers a miserly 0.5% increase which, under the terms of social partnership, will not kick in for a further 18 months?  Given the Taoiseach&rsquo;s experience as Minister for Finance and in other portfolios, this defies understanding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may not engage in a monologue. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking for an explanation.  While the Ceann Comhairle has probably been provided with all the information, it is not available to me.  I cannot understand how the Taoiseach and other Ministers, with their collective experience, could have stood over a budget proposition last week which clearly fritters away all semblance of fairness and the meagre elements&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may not make a speech on the budget when the House is discussing questions on social partnership. </P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the meagre measures in the agreement being frittered away by the measures announced last week during the grandstand performance we witnessed in the House. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask the Taoiseach to reply. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach to explain how this could be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to answer, please. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make a few points in reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s comments.  We live in exceptional economic circumstances.  The income levy is a progressive effort to ensure those on high incomes pay proportionately.  The progressive nature of the levy, which applies to gross income, would not have been possible to achieve if one had used the tax rates, given the availability of shelters and allowances.</P><Col N="283"/>
        <P>The Deputy is correct that an additional 0.5%, to be paid in the third phase, was negotiated by the unions in respect of low and modest pay.  It is important to point out that this differential remains.  On the basis that a 1% levy will apply to people on low pay and a 2% levy will apply to those earning more than &euro;100,00 per annum, the differential between these groups will be 1.5%.  If the Deputy&rsquo;s argument is that the differential must be maintained, that is already being achieved.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy&rsquo;s subsequent question is about the extent to which we can protect incomes at the lower level, as I indicated, the Government is prepared to contribute to that objective by ensuring levy does not apply at or below the minimum wage.  At the time of the signing of the agreement, the inflation forecast was 3% for 2009, whereas the inflation now forecast for next year is 2.5%.  In fact the problem next year will not be inflation, but deflation &mdash; we are seeing inflation going down as a result of reduced activity and the flattening out of export markets in terms of activity as well.  That differential is being retained and the 0.5% in terms of the protection of living standards will now be available next year to a greater extent, in addition to what was already negotiated.</P>
        <P>When one looks at this in the continuum, the fact is that we have achieved an enormous amount during the good times, in terms of taking people out of the tax net altogether.  Some 500,000 people on low and modest incomes who had previously paid tax were taken out of the tax net, as a result of the Government&rsquo;s policies.  There is also the point that the average industrial wage has increased by &euro;15,000 in that period as well, yet the amount of <i>per capita</i> tax paid is &euro;1,000 less.  That is a very important fact.  In 1983 the average industrial wage was &euro;18,000 and now it is around &euro;35,000.  As regards those on low pay as well, there is the question of increasing the family income supplement, FIS, eligibility arrangements for working families with children.  This ensures that a family on FIS in receipt of &euro;20,000 in wages, now gets an additional &euro;726, if there are two children.  These are important &ldquo;other mechanisms&rdquo;, when one looks at how the taxation impacts on take home pay, along with the fact that so many people have been taken out of the tax net, when in the past  &mdash; before the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration came back into office in 1997 &mdash; after pretty meagre allowances, people were paying a standard rate of 26%.</P>
        <P>There is, therefore, an indication of a very concentrated effort when times were good to lighten the load of workers and the tax take of the average industrial wage was reduced from 27% to 15% as a result.  We now face exceptional times, and an income levy was introduced which maintained the differential.  The fact that there will be lower inflation next year than at the time of its negotiation is a further indication as to why people should have a positive disposition towards having the pay agreement ratified.  I hope all of these issues and information can be taken into the mix, as well as the fact that we are living in exceptional times.  It is important in terms of participatory democracy that people are in a position to pay according to their means, recognising the weight we give to social partnership.  As I said, I was in a position to announce today that it would not apply to those on the minimum wage or lower.</P>

	<P>I welcome the fact that the Government appears to be making some movement on the income tax levy and is offering some response to the position that was put to it by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  However, I would like to know more about what it intends to do here.  What will be the cost of the decision to now exempt earnings at or below the national minimum wage from the income levy?  In the context of the budgetary arithmetic, where is it proposed that this will come from? </P>
        <P Just="Left">How will this work?  Will incomes at or under the national minimum wage be exempt from the levy or will employees whose income is at or under the minimum wage be exempt?  What is the position of somebody earning just over the national minimum, say, &euro;1 weekly or &euro;100 more per annum?  Will he or she be liable for the levy on his or her entire income or on the portion of his or her income over the national minimum wage?  What is the position of somebody on the national minimum wage who does a bit of overtime?  Will he or she be liable for the levy on the full amount of the income or just on the portion of overtime he or she does?  What is the position of somebody who has two part-time jobs, one on the national minimum wage and one above it?  Will he or she pay the levy on the totality of his or her income or only on the job which is above the national minimum wage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach regret having entered into this recent pay agreement under social partnership given that any increases will be taken away by increases in taxation?  Does he agree it makes a total farce of the situation that in order to meet the targets set, he must reduce services other than pay?  Cutting services to the public will make more public servants redundant because they will not be available, or needed, to provide the services.  The whole situation is contradictory.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the sensible thing to do is to ask for a two year pay freeze rather than have this ongoing situation of increasing taxation to make up for the pay increases and of cutting services which makes more public servants redundant?</P>

	<P>To answer Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s question, as he knows, this is a levy on gross income and, therefore, in respect of anything above that, the levy is applied on the full amount.  That is the way it operates.  A person on &euro;18,000 a year, beyond the minimum wage, will be asked for a contribution of &euro;180 for the year, or &euro;3.50 tax.  In the past, Deputy Gilmore was a member of a Government which probably charged them 26% tax on practically all that income.  The person has one twenty-sixth of the burden he or she had in 1997 when Deputy Gilmore was Minister of State in the Department of the Marine.</P>
        <P>That is the way the levy system works.  It was the way it worked when it was introduced in 1992-93 under a Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party Administration.  It was also a temporary levy at that time.  From memory, it applied to people on half the industrial wage which at that time was only &euro;9,000.  We are a long way beyond that now thanks to successful policies implemented in the interim.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Barrett&rsquo;s question, under this agreement, we have a three month pay pause in the private sector and an 11 month pay pause in the public sector which should not be ignored and which is a good contribution by workers in an effort to contribute to stability.  There are also inability to pay clauses available to employers who are not in a position to assist.</P><Col N="285"/>
        <P>It is not correct to say nothing is being asked of the public sector in respect of payroll costs.  We have indicated the necessity for a reduction of 4% on payroll costs in the coming year as a contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That is different.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.  A reduction in payroll costs provides for getting a 4% reduction over 2008 outturn levels in 2009.  It provides management with the necessary flexibility to deal with that matter rather than a more blunt instrument like an embargo where many exceptions are sought and catered for in respect of emergency workers, etc.</P>
        <P>In respect of that way of doing things, even this year the Minister for Finance pointed out that the savings he sought from July, when he made his initial announcement of measures for savings, will be exceeded under that heading during 2008 by reason of applying it in that way and by giving management the flexibility to deal with these issues in a sensible way that does not impact adversely on service provision which it would otherwise do if it was a blunt instrument.</P>
        <P>I apologise to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in but on the point he raised, the board of Aer Lingus directed management to engage with the trade union group to see how it can come forward with the necessary savings in what is currently a competitive and difficult aviation sector.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>    the reason for the delay in processing applications in respect of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit; the reason there are variations in processing times across the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.    </Quest>
        <QRef>[36035/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department is committed to providing a high quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.</P>
        <P>These conditions vary between the two jobseeker schemes and involve, among other things, the need to establish the person&rsquo;s social insurance record, establish the person&rsquo;s identity or place of habitual residence and the assessment of means where appropriate.  In some cases delays arise where people fail to supply all pertinent information in support of their application.</P>
        <P>The level of inflows to the live register over the period January to September 2008, inclusive, was 311,660 as compared to 220,652 over the corresponding period last year, representing an increase of over 41%.  The average weekly inflow was 7,991 as compared to 5,658 in 2007.  At 5 October 2008, there were 39,133 jobseeker payment claims pending in local and branch offices, made up of 16,857 jobseeker benefit and 22,276 jobseeker allowance claims.  The average processing time for applications in September was three weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claims and six weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that anyone who is under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on their claim for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment can apply for supplementary welfare allowance which is subject to a means test and other qualifying conditions.  The Department delivers a frontline service through a network of 61 local offices and 65 branch offices countrywide. <Col N="286"/> Local offices are staffed by civil servants while the branch offices operate under a contract for service.  All decisions on claims are made in the local office.  The overall performance in any individual office in processing claims can be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors, including increased inflow of claims, staff vacancies and the duration of such vacancies, and the turnover of staff in the office.</P>
        <P>The Department has put a range of measures in place to deal with the extra workload arising from the increase in the live register.  These include additional posts assigned, use of temporary staff to fill vacancies pending the appointment of permanent staff, the extension of temporary staff contracts in certain offices, increased overtime and the prioritisation of work.  These measures are being reviewed on a continual basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear the measures being taken are not working because the figures the Minister gave me for October more or less correlate to the figures I have for September.  Therefore the measures taken are not decreasing the queues.  The Minister said failure to supply all pertinent information can be one of the reasons for the difficulties.  Are the people of Galway or Navan particularly incapable of filling in the forms compared to those in other places where there is only a three to six-week delay, depending on the application?  There is almost a four-month delay for those applying through the office in Galway.  How does the Minister intend to deal with this?  </P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware that unemployment is at its highest in a decade, a decade in which her party has been in power?  It is expected there will be 60,000 more people on the live register next year.  In view of the four-month delay in some offices, how will the system cope when there are 60,000 more applications?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The people who were being assessed in September are not necessarily the people being assessed in October.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has made no improvement in the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, there would be a throughput of new people.  I agree with the Deputy there are unacceptable delays in some offices.  Those offices are being examined by the Department with a view to establishing what additional staffing, overtime or temporary staff are required.  A high level review of staffing generally is being finalised and should conclude next week.  Additional posts have been allocated and there is an increase over this period last year in the number of people working in this service.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the fact that any delay can be difficult for the applicant.  There is a six-week average processing time for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance because it requires a much more in-depth review of people&rsquo;s financial circumstances and a three-week average time for the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Hanafin is the Minister and if the delay is unacceptable, it means she is not doing her job and ensuring it is dealt with.  Does she realise that not getting jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or benefit pushes families into an almost inescapable poverty trap?  They fall behind with ESB, gas and telephone payments.  They also fall behind with mortgage repayments, car loans and credit union loans.  They are stuck in that cycle.  They can go cap in hand and look for a supplementary welfare allowance, but they want the proper allowance and it is up to the Minister to ensure they can get it within an acceptable timeframe.</P><Col N="287"/>
        <P>The budgetary changes announced by the Minister last week will lead to even more bureaucracy within the social welfare system.  When will we see an acceptable timeframe in which these services will be delivered?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not envisage the budgetary changes will put an added burden on any of the administrative measures that need to be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>It will put a burden on the people involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Staffing is a matter for the Department and the Secretary General, and that is the reason the high level review is being undertaken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, not the Secretary General, is in charge of the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>No Minister determines how many people go to a particular office or who those people are.  It is interesting to hear on the one hand that people are looking for a cutback in the number of people working in the Civil Service or public service but on the other they want to see more staff allocated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I never said that, I said I wanted to see an improvement in respect of the timeframe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 1,343 people working actively on this.  There is huge pressure on staff in many offices.  We recognise that and that is the reason we have taken the measures of allocating extra people, providing overtime and putting in temporary staff.  This is being kept under constant review, particularly in the offices where there is a particular delay.  I repeat, nobody need be destitute or in poverty.  People can go to the social welfare officer for supplementary assistance.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>    the improvements she will make to the back to education allowance and the back to work enterprise allowance in order that unemployed people can avail of these supports within a few months of their signing on the live register.    </Quest>
        <QRef>[35949/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>A range of education and employment supports are available to persons in receipt of welfare payments to assist and facilitate their return to the active labour force.  These measures include the back to work allowance and back to education allowance.</P>
        <P>The back to education allowance is designed to encourage people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  It enables qualified people who have been getting a social welfare payment to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course.</P>
        <P>In general, to qualify for participation an applicant must be at least 21 years of age and must have been in receipt of a social welfare payment immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study for at least six months for a second level course and 12 months for a third level course.  The 12-month requirement is reduced to nine months for people participating in the national employment action plan, NEAP.  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P><Col N="288"/>
        <P>The back to work allowance scheme is designed to assist the long-term unemployed and other social welfare recipients to return to work.  There are two strands to the scheme, the back to work enterprise allowance for the self-employed and the back to work allowance for employees.  The scheme is designed to support people who would not otherwise be able to return to the workforce for financial reasons.  To qualify for this allowance, the person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment for a specific length of time immediately prior to commencing employment.</P>
        <P>The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the back to education and back to work schemes, which were designed to recognise the special difficulties that people who have been unemployed for a long time can face when attempting to gain a foothold in the labour market.</P>
        <P>I will continue to monitor the schemes but I believe that, overall, they continue to meet their objectives and that the time requirements ensure that limited resources are targeted at those who are most in need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept the budget should be judged on two issues, whether it is fair and whether it helps the economy and jobs?  The public has given a clear answer on the first and the budget is clearly not fair.  With regard to jobs, not only is the Government making matters more difficult for people who find themselves unemployed in terms of cutting their entitlements, but the budget has done nothing to help them to get back into employment.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept the priority must be to ensure that people who become unemployed now do not become the long-term unemployed of the future?  What is the justification for the time lag between a person becoming unemployed and being able to avail of the back to education or back to enterprise allowances?  Surely in this day and age the priority must be to try to enable unemployed people to get back into work, enterprise or training as quickly as possible.  Why does the Minister maintain those excessively restrictive rules?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct in saying that the overall aim of the budget and of the Government is to ensure that people return to work.  The responsibility for that rests with all of us.  She will have recognised that the budget contained specific measures for small companies and new start-up businesses, and taxation measures that come under the ambit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, all of which are important.  The budget&rsquo;s overall taxation package will also ensure that we can continue to attract investment into the country.  Measures such as the research and development grants ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place for people to come and provide employment.  The Deputy is right that employment is the key and that was the overall consideration.</P>
        <P>Education is also key.  Back to education is just one of the areas in which we can support people.  It is encouraging that approximately 8,000 people are participating in that scheme.  In early September, with the help and support of Brian Mooney of the Institute of Guidance Councillors, all the facilitators throughout the country were invited to Dublin to make them aware of the latest developments in education so that they can actively advise people as to where they can turn to improve their skills and education.</P>

	<P>Go raibh maith agat, a Aire.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that was a very positive contribution.  It is also very important that the back to education scheme facilitates people on social welfare.  The Deputy <Col N="289"/>will be well aware that a few years ago there was serious abuse of the scheme, not, let it be said, by unemployed people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but by people using Ireland as a base to try to get this scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The qualifying criteria for these schemes were designed in a different era for a very different problem.  Why must a person who becomes unemployed wait at least 12 months before being permitted to avail of the back to education allowance in order to attend a third level course?  Surely an unemployed person should be encouraged in every way possible to avail of further training to enable him or her to apply for new jobs in the future.</P>
        <P>What on earth is the justification for requiring an unemployed person to wait for at least two years before he or she has an entitlement to the back to enterprise allowance?  Surely we should be doing everything we possibly can to ensure that unemployed people get back into education and back into enterprise as quickly as possible.  There can be no justification for those time lags.  Why will the Minister not reconsider those?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a justification for having timelines.  For example, we do not want someone who has just completed his or her leaving certificate examinations drawing the dole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister knows that is not what I am talking about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It does and can happen, but we do not want it to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>

        <Quest>    the way she will ensure that the information on 374,000 persons, whose personal data were contained on laptop computers recently stolen from her Department, is not being misused or compromised; the number of persons who have contacted her Department on this matter; if her attention has been drawn to any interference or fraud activity connected with the missing information; and if she will make a statement on the matter.    </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department was notified in April 2007 that a laptop computer belonging to the Comptroller and Auditor General had been taken from the offices of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The theft was immediately reported to the Garda.  Some 16 months later, in early August 2008, the Department was informed that the laptop computer contained personal data relating to social welfare customers.  The Department moved swiftly to respond to the incident and has taken all reasonable steps to minimise the concerns <Col N="291"/>of the customers whose records were contained on it.  Letters issued to customers informing them of the incident.  A helpline was set up to answer inquires arising from this matter.  An e-mail address and a post office box number were provided for written inquires.</P>
        <P>The Department was also in contact with the Garda and payment institutions to alert them to the incident.  While the Department notified the appropriate banks about the incident, individuals whose bank details were included on the laptop computer were advised, as an added assurance, to check their bank statements to establish if there had been any unusual activity.</P>
        <P>The Department worked closely with the Data Protection Commissioner regarding his response to this incident.  The commissioner welcomed the manner in which the Department addressed the issue by writing to those directly affected and establishing a dedicated helpdesk to provide further information and assistance as required.  He stated publicly that he considered that this approach represented &ldquo;best practice and a truly first rate response in the circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Up to the time that the helpdesk ceased operating on 3 October, 16,500 calls had been made to the special helpline number, 161 e-mails had been received and responded to and 750 letters have been received and are being dealt with.</P>
        <P>The information contained on the laptop computer alone would not be sufficient to access public services.  Public bodies, employers and others who are authorised to use the PPS number are required to exercise diligence in properly identifying those whom they employ or with whom they transact business.  Additional evidence of identity such as photographic ID, signature, mother&rsquo;s birth surname, PIN, password etc. is required to fulfil this purpose.</P>
        <P>From contacts to date with the Garda and various other Government and payment institutions, there has been no indication of any systematic misuse of the information contained on the laptop computer during the 18 months since the theft occurred.</P>
     
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>The Department has been engaged in a programme of continual development and deployment of measures to enhance data security.  Since this incident came to light, the Department has further reviewed and enhanced its protocols for the transfer of data to third parties, including the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  All bulk data are now transferred in an encrypted format in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s external party electronic data transfer policy.</P>

	<P>Has there been any non-systematic misuse of the information from the laptop computer?  The laptop computer was stolen from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Were departmental officials made aware of its theft when it was stolen?  What was the reason for the 16-month delay before the Minister was informed of it having been taken?  There was a commitment that all laptop computers in the Department of Social and Family Affairs would be retrospectively encrypted.  Has this happened with all the laptop computers in the Department?  Likewise there was to be a restriction on the use of USB memory sticks.  Has that measure been implemented?  Will the Minister ensure that this type of information is not easily removed from the places where it needs to be accessed and that when it is removed it is all encrypted?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The laptop computer, which was the property of the Comptroller and Auditor General, was used in an office solely used by the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I understand it was just the caretaking and security people who were informed that it was lost.  However, no indication was given at <Col N="292"/>that time that there was information on it.  It was only when the loss of subsequent laptop computers from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General came to public attention that it came to light that this amount of information was on it.  That is why there was a gap in informing us.  As soon as we were informed in August 2008, 16 months later, we immediately put in place the processes I have outlined to allay people&rsquo;s fears.  Judging by the response, I believe those fears have been allayed.  There is no indication that the information has been used in any way.</P>
        <P>Obviously such an incident causes everybody to review security arrangements.  Now the information is password protected on personal accounts with a secure network.  There are bespoke application interfaces which can control the level and type of information to individuals who are working in the Department.  People who are looking to access information from the system need to make a business case to management, which determines whether that staff member may have that information.  We have also added read-access logging.  The electronic data are stored in a secure computer site.  The perimeter of the site is also secured.  Encryption is now in place for all information that is being transferred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Is encryption now in place on all the Department of Social and Family Affairs laptop computers?  Anyone who is in anyway good at this will be able to get around a password.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor was questioned on a similar matter in October 2007 when there was abuse of information by a Department of Social and Family Affairs official.  At the time he advised that a high-level group was constantly reviewing all aspects of controls and security management.  Has this high-level group chaired by the Secretary General made a full report on the issue?  A laptop was stolen in a house break in and two desktop computers were stolen from a social welfare office.  Can the Minister be fully satisfied information about people is secure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Two relevant policies were introduced recently &mdash; the external party electronic data transfer policy and the portable computing device security policy.  It is now Department policy to password protect all laptops and all new laptops are encrypted.  Existing laptops are being recalled for encryption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Within what timescale will that be completed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are not many laptops and, therefore, it is a priority.  We are also engaged in a policy to restrict the usage of USB memory devices.  Staff members who need such devices will be issued with encrypted devices and future usage will be restricted to them.</P>
        <P>Laptops are generally used to access centrally stored information.  No client data is retained on laptops.  It was a highly unusual situation and we asked the Comptroller and Auditor General why all the encrypted information was downloaded to a laptop and made readable.  This is the issue that caused concern for people.  Given changing technologies, we must keep this policy firmly under review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The national employment action plan is the Government&rsquo;s main welfare to work measure.  It has been in operation since 1998 and proved successful in that period in assisting people on the live register back into employment.  It is a preventive strategy that provides systematic engagement of the employment services with the unemployed.</P>
        <P>The operation of the plan involves referral of people on the live register who have been unemployed for a certain period to F&Aacute;S.  Currently, every person between the ages of 18 and 65 years approaching three months on the live register is referred to F&Aacute;S for interview with a view to assisting them in finding employment.  Clients are given an interview time and are requested to present for interview with a F&Aacute;S employment officer at the appointed time.  It is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s labour market policy.  The employment action plan provides access to the range of employment, training and education opportunities afforded by F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>In the five years ending December 2007, a total of 226,052 people on the live register were referred to F&Aacute;S under the plan.  A total of 149,806 were interviewed, of whom 39,022 were placed in jobs, training or education and a further 31,401 left the live register shortly after the interview but without additional intervention from F&Aacute;S.  In the period between January and August 2008, a total of 40,407 people were referred to F&Aacute;S, of whom 26,132 were interviewed by the agency and 4,618 were placed in jobs, training or education.  Information is not collected on those returning to the live register in a manner that would identify whether their most recent employment resulted from a F&Aacute;S job placement.</P>
        <P>The employment action plan process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the live register.  It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by F&Aacute;S.  In addition to the plan, a range of other education and employment supports are available to persons in receipt of welfare payments.  These initiatives are designed to assist and facilitate people on social welfare payments to return to the active labour force.  These measures include the back to work allowance and back to education allowance, which I dealt with earlier.  A team of facilitators is also in place in the Department to provide additional, more intensive assistance, for those who need it such as people who have been identified by F&Aacute;S as needing further support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the figures.  However, there is a significant gap between the number being interviewed by F&Aacute;S and the number referred to employment and training programmes.  Between January and July 2008, 35,000 people were referred by the Department to F&Aacute;S of whom 1,344 were referred to agency schemes and 275 to further education and training.  Why are those figures so low?  The Minister stated the Department does not collate information regarding the number of people on F&Aacute;S placements who subsequently take up employment.  Would it be a good idea to do so in order that we can establish what is working?  It is difficult to improve an organisation if the facts are not available, although I appreciate F&Aacute;S does not come within the Minister&rsquo;s remit.  Is the Minister happy the system is working and is effective?  What changes have been made in the past year in the interaction between the Department and F&Aacute;S bearing in mind unemployment is increasing steadily?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like more interaction between F&Aacute;S and those on the live register.  Currently, 1,620 interview slots are available and more use could be made of them.  I did not outline the number of people who leave the live register when invited by F&Aacute;S for interview.  That means F&Aacute;S has capacity to call more people than it anticipates turning up.  Of the 40,000 clients referred to the agency by the Department between July and August this year, 26,000 were interviewed.  However, 20,000 people had left the live register, which includes those <Col N="294"/>who did not show for interview or who had secured employment.  I have raised this issue with F&Aacute;S officials.</P>
        <P>I also mentioned to them that I am concerned about the number of people the agency is unable to place because they need more support.  That is why an additional ten facilitators were employed from September to work directly with these people to establish their needs.  Do they have basic education or literacy problems?  What training do they need?  We are also ensuring people are recalled by F&Aacute;S more frequently than in the past.  Joint meetings take place regularly between the agency and the Department to review this policy.  It would be wrong not to acknowledge the successes where people have been placed in jobs, training and education.  However, there is scope for more placements and that is why I have been working with the agency on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>F&Aacute;S has a budget of &euro;1 billion per year.  Last year the Minister stated 51,500 people were referred to the agency by her Department of whom 2,763 were referred to employment and training programmes and 866 to further education.  Approximately 3,600 people, therefore, were referred further by an agency with a budget of &euro;1 billion.  I appreciate it is engaged in other activities but its core function is to assist the unemployed to return to work.  By any measure, that is a failure.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated twice she appointed 50 facilitators during the summer to work with lone parents and the unemployed on a one-to-one basis, which means each facilitator must carry a caseload of 8,000 people.  How can one person deal with 8,000 people and give them an opportunity to leave the live register and return to work?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The facilitators will not work with everybody.  A significant number of people join the live register for a week or a month.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>This involves tens of thousands of people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>F&Aacute;S identifies the people who can best benefit from this process.  The additional interaction with the facilitators and education can help to support that.  The aim is to deploy a facilitator in all the major offices to do that work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>They will not deal with people on a one-to-one basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct that the F&Aacute;S budget is &euro;1 billion.  Many training programmes are undertaken that do not involve people on the live register, including those for apprentices who have a particular difficulty currently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>A difficulty that has not been solved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The agency has adapted the courses its offers.  For example, staff in its Loughlinstown centre are working closely with companies in Cherrywood to ensure they can meet their employment needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>    her view on the recent statement by the Combat Poverty Agency that budget 2009 fails to protect the most vulnerable in society and will impact negatively on low-income households; and if she will make a statement on the matter.    </Quest>
        <QRef>[36038/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the recent budget, the Government had three main priorities, namely, to restore order and stability in the public finances, to increase productivity and competitiveness and to protect the most vulnerable in our country.  Social welfare was prioritised in the budget.  Next year, total funding for the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be &euro;19.6 billion.  This represents an increase of &euro;2.6 billion or 15.5% on the Estimates allocation for 2008.  More than 1.7 million people and their dependants will benefit from this expenditure, including 440,000 pensioners, 345,000 ill and disabled people, more than 80,000 carers, 30,000 low income working families availing of the family income supplement and more than 580,000 families in receipt of child benefit payments.</P>
        <P>Provision has been made for &euro;515 million worth of improvements in social welfare rates and qualifying conditions.  These include &euro;7 extra per week for State pensioners, an extra &euro;2 per week in the fuel allowance, with payment also being made for an additional two weeks, &euro;6.50 extra per week for welfare recipients of working age, such as those on job seekers and illness payments, and increases in the qualified adult allowance, which maintain the value of that payment as a proportion of the personal rate.  The budget also provides for an increase of &euro;2 per week, or 8.3%, in the qualified child increase, bringing it to &euro;26 per child per week.</P>
        <P>The qualifying threshold for the family income supplement, FIS, is also being increased by &euro;10 per child to benefit low income working families with children.  This change will result in an average increase of approximately &euro;6 per child and will ensure that approximately 2,000 additional families will become eligible for the payment next year.  Some 18,000 more families will benefit from the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance next year.</P>
        <P>All weekly income maintenance payments increased by amounts varying from 3% to 3.8% in the budget, thereby fully protecting people from inflation, which is predicted to average 2.5% next year.  The increases are also ahead of the projected growth in gross average industrial earnings next year and are in line with the wage increases agreed by the social partners in the second phase of the national pay agreement.</P>
        <P>In its poverty impact assessment using the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH model, the Department established that the social welfare budget proposals would lead to a reduction in the risk of poverty.  At a time when it is essential that public expenditure be strictly controlled in the national interest, this increased provision for social welfare is an unambiguous statement of the Government&rsquo;s intention to protect the vulnerable and less well-off in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>If anything ever showed the need for an independent agency, it is that answer.  I will ask for the Minister&rsquo;s opinions.  The Combat Poverty Agency is an advisory body that uses evidence-based proposals to combat poverty.  Recently, the Minister stated that the agency was established when people needed to focus on combating poverty.  Given this statement, does the Government believe that we no longer need to focus on poverty?  It would be a natural conclusion to draw.</P>
        <P>From a poverty perspective, what is the Minister&rsquo;s opinion on the introduction of the 1% levy?  The issue is being revisited, but people on the minimum wage who earn anything else will fall under it.  Is the Minister aware that, according to the Central Statistics Office, 10% of <Col N="296"/>people living in consistent poverty are in employment?  How will the budget&rsquo;s addition of a levy address this matter and help to take them out of consistent poverty?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware that a low income household spends just under 50% of its total weekly income on food and fuel, which are staples?  A family on an average income spends only<?oasys _jy ?>20%.  How can the Minister disagree with the conclusions drawn by the Combat Poverty Agency?  As it is still a Government advisory agency, why is she not taking its views on the budget on board?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>All social welfare payments are exempt from the levy.  The people to whom Deputy Enright referred, workers on low incomes, may qualify for FIS.  Two measures are important.  The first is the increase in the threshold by &euro;10 per week to give a net gain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government gives it with one hand and takes it away with the other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of &euro;6, while the second is the extension of FIS to approximately 2,000 additional families.  These measures should protect a number of people.</P>
        <P>In terms of families and children and the pressures of returning to school, an additional 18,000 families will qualify for the relevant allowance.  Other details of the levy will only be seen in the Finance Bill when it is finalised by the Minister.  The Government remains committed to combating poverty and the specific targets we set will remain our aims until 2012 and 2016.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister believe that the targets will be met in the agreed timeframes?  In light of the budget, the Combat Poverty Agency believes it cannot be done.  Will the Minister guarantee the agency&rsquo;s independence now that it will be subsumed into her Department?  Will the new body, be it the &ldquo;Office of Social Inclusion&rdquo; or so on, be able to make statements on the next budget as the Combat Poverty Agency has done on this budget?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Targets were set during a time of plenty.  While we do not have the same resources, it is still our aim&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The poor are getting poorer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to meet those targets, as shown in the outlined figures.  A certain target was set for 2012 and another for 2016, both of which are a long way off.  We are working towards the targets.</P>
        <P>No matter what my position is, I have always valued independent advice and research and evidence-based data.  It is important that this trend continues in my work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 142 together.</P>
        <P>The development of a national carers strategy is a key Government commitment in both the national partnership agreement Towards 2016 and the programme for Government.  A working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach is working on developing the strategy.  My Department provides the secretariat to the working group, which also includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as well as F&Aacute;S and the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Developing the strategy involves consultation with other Departments and bodies not represented on the working group.  The Department has met with a wide range of organisations, including the Equality Authority, the Combat Poverty Agency, the Citizens Information Board, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the National Disability Authority.  A request for submissions from the public was published in regional newspapers in early March.  The closing date for submissions was Friday, 18 April.  There was a good response from individuals and organisations and the submissions received are being examined.</P>
        <P>Towards 2016 commits the Department to hosting an annual consultation meeting of carer representative groups and relevant Departments and agencies.  Such a meeting was held on 23 January 2008.  Representatives of 12 groups and nine Departments and bodies attended.  The theme was the national carers strategy and groups were given an opportunity to comment on the draft terms of reference and to raise other issues considered relevant in the context of the strategy.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to launch the report, Listening to Carers: Report on a Nationwide Carer Consultation, produced by the Carers Association in partnership with Caring for Carers Ireland and Care Alliance Ireland on 30 June this year.  The issues raised in the report are being considered as part of the development of the strategy.</P>
        <P>The commitment to the development of a national carers strategy also includes a commitment to appropriate consultation with the social partners.  An update on the strategy was provided to the social partners&rsquo; plenary session in February.  The first of two consultation meetings with the social partners was held on 8 May.  Key issues raised were recognition for carers and their work, access to suitable health services, income support, training, gender issues and balancing employment and care.  We are working on bringing the carers strategy to completion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been considerable slippage in the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s undertaking.  Is it a case of the Government not giving adequate priority to the work of carers?  The programme for Government states: &ldquo;Ensure a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy focusing on supporting informal and family carers in the community will be developed by the end of 2007.&rdquo;  That is a delay of ten months.  It would be easy to come to the conclusion that the Minister, who is new to her Department, is not giving adequate priority to the issues of carers.  The country depends on the vast number of people providing care to ensure that people can remain in their homes and that the cost to the Exchequer does not go through the roof entirely.</P>
        <P>What is the reason for the ten-month delay in delivering on the undertaking given in the programme for Government?  At what point is the publication of the strategy expected?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be well aware that, according to Towards 2016, the strategy was due for publication by the end of 2007, but there was a particular pressure on the Green Paper on Pensions at the time.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Certainly.  Last year, one group of officials was working on two major items, namely, the carers strategy and the Green Paper on Pensions.  Work was also ongoing in respect of nursing homes, a matter in which the Department of Social and Family Affairs had an input.  That the paper and the carers strategy were not published at the time did not take from the Government&rsquo;s commitment, as shown in last year&rsquo;s budget, which dealt with half-rate carers, substantial increases in respite care and the introduction of large income disregards.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>My question relates to the carers strategy.  When can we expect it to be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not an indication of a lack of commitment on the part of the Government that the strategy has not yet been published&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no sign of it after ten months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Significant provisions have been put in place to recognise the important work of carers in society.  Since then, work has been ongoing on submissions, meetings and consultations.  That work is now drawing towards completion.  It involves not only my Department but also the Department of the Taoiseach and, in particular, the Department of <Col N="299"/>Health and Children.  Most carers have concerns, for example, in regard to supports available from the Health Service Executive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>It is pathetic to discover that staff in the Minister&rsquo;s department can work on only one project at a time.  The programme for Government contained a commitment to devise a national carers strategy and to introduce a Green Paper on pensions.  We are currently awaiting the White Paper on pensions.  Is the Minister now saying there will be no progress in this regard until the carers strategy is completed?  The Civil Service has grown by tens of thousands in the period in which Fianna F&aacute;il has been in government.  It is pathetic that it can only work on one strategy at a time.</P>
        <P>When the document is finally produced, will it include specific targets and timeframes for delivery or will it be merely a grandiose visionary document that proves to be just as meaningless as the programme for Government seems to be?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year&rsquo;s budget afforded more recognition to carers than any of its predecessors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The bodies representing carers have described this year&rsquo;s budget as a bitter blow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important where strategies are being devised, particularly when they involve cross-departmental input, that they are given the care and attention they require.  The bringing forward of the budget has put pressure on all Departments and Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is making commitments she does not intend to honour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is our intention to continue to work on the critically important pensions strategy.  We are working towards completing that, as well as the carers strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I will repeat my question.  When does the Minister expect to be in a position to publish the carers strategy, which is now ten months late?  It is not good enough to suggest that the strategy can wait because the Government is, in the meantime, taking steps to improve the position of carers.  That is not the case.  The budget for 2009 provides carers with the smallest increase, a mere 3%, out of all social welfare recipients.  The programme for Government includes three other undertakings to carers, none of which was delivered in the budget.  When will the Minister deliver on these commitments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will be pleased to deliver on the programme for Government commitments as soon as the budgetary position allows.  I will publish the strategy immediately after I bring it to Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>When will that be?  The Minister has given a ridiculous answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>    the steps she has taken to abolish the ceiling on PRSI.    </Quest>
        <QRef>[34848/08]</QRef>
      </Qst><Col N="300"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the PRSI system, social insurance contributions are compulsorily payable by employers and employed and self-employed workers.  In the case of employees&rsquo; contributions, the amount payable is determined by reference to reckonable earnings in a weekly period and is subject to a range of thresholds and an annual ceiling.</P>
        <P>The PRSI exemption on low earnings stands at &euro;352 per week.  In other words, incomes at or below that level are exempt from PRSI.  In the case of workers who earn above this level, their total income, up to the annual ceiling, is chargeable to PRSI.  However, they are entitled to a PRSI-free allowance of &euro;127 per week.  Approximately 76% of workers pay PRSI class A and class H at the rate of 4% and accrue entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions under various social insurance schemes.</P>
        <P>The employee PRSI ceiling is reviewed annually in accordance with the legislative stipulations of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005.  The legislation requires that changes in the average earnings of workers, as recorded by the Central Statistics Office, be taken into account in this regard.  In the 2009 budget, the employee ceiling was increased by &euro;1,300 from &euro;50,700 to &euro;52,000, in line with projected increases in earnings for 2009.</P>
        <P>The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund 2005 report, published last year, found that paying social insurance contributions represents good value for money in almost all circumstances.  In particular, the report stated that those on lower incomes fare considerably better than those on higher incomes, with persons earning less than the gross average industrial wage paying 35% of the contributions but receiving 66% of the benefits.  This finding demonstrates the solidarity principle of the social insurance system whereby contributions paid by insured persons are not actuarially linked to benefits but are instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.  It is an expression of solidarity between both earning groups and generations.</P>
        <P>Any future changes to the PRSI ceiling must be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her contribution.  However, she did not reply to the question, which related to any steps she may have taken to remove the ceiling on PRSI.  Is she aware that such a removal would amount to an income stream of &euro;334 million to the social insurance fund, thus offering a substantially greater saving than the &euro;100 million to be gleaned by attacking pensioners over 70 years of age?  Would such a move not be preferable to attacking, via the 1% so-called levy, low income workers, including those on the minimum wage?  It would be far more equitable to go after those who can afford to pay.  If the Minister does not agree, will she explain her reasoning?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be appropriate for me to comment on any measures being discussed in the context of the budget.  Deputy Morgan referred to what are revenue-raising measures for the Exchequer.  However, PRSI contributions go directly into the social insurance fund and cannot be diverted for other purposes.   Any changes in PRSI provisions must be made with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.  Savings across other Departments do not impact on the fund and PRSI receipts do not impact on the Exchequer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>In her contribution in the budget debate, the Minister told us that expenditure this year in regard to the social insurance fund would exceed income by &euro;200 million and that this shortfall is expected to increase to &euro;900 million next year.  Will she explain how it is proposed to plug that hole this year and next?  Given the size of the gap, why did the Government not fulfil its undertaking in the programme for Government to lift the ceiling on PRSI?  The change announced in the budget is marginal.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="301"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The current deficit in the fund can be met in this and for some future years from the accumulated surplus.  Therefore, there is no need as yet to plug the gap.  However, it will be important to keep the situation under review.  We must examine all revenue-raising measures and savings in terms of how they impact on families.  This is one of the measures that is kept under review by both Departments.  For now, that shortfall can be met from the surplus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I had a slip of the tongue in referring to the Exchequer.  We all anticipate that there will be a significant number of additional social welfare recipients in the coming 12 months.  Why would the Minister not want to have at her disposal the additional funding that would arise from abolishing the PRSI ceiling in order to meet the needs of those who will require assistance?  Why has she not pressed the Minister for Finance to take this route?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 118 and 169 together.</P>
        <P>The living alone allowance or living alone increase as it is now known, is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week to people who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who live alone.  The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone.  The policy in regard to support for older people has been for many years to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension in addition to enhancing the household benefits package and other supports rather than supplementing the living alone increase.  The objective is to use resources to improve the position of all pensioners to the fullest extent possible.</P>
        <P>The results of this policy can be seen in the most recent results from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, SILC, which show that the position of older people improved significantly from 2005 to 2006 with the &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo; rate falling from 20.1% to 13.6% and the consistent poverty rate falling from 3.7% to 2.1%.  This latter result indicates that we have met the target set in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  Furthermore, the number of people aged 65 and over at risk of poverty was significantly lower than the figure of 17% for the general population.  These figures do not take account of the significant increases in pensions in the 2007 and 2008 budgets so the position can be expected to improve further.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2009, we have provided for increases of &euro;7 per week in the personal rate of pensions.  This is broadly in line with inflation and so will maintain the real value of pension <Col N="302"/>payments and protect the very significant progress we have made in recent years in reducing the poverty risk for all older people.  While I acknowledge the overall and positive impact of increasing the resources of all pensions, I am also conscious of the particular difficulties which older people face when living alone.  I intend to keep this matter under review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has studiously avoided answering my question.  The Vincentian Partnership carried out worthwhile research into minimum essential budgets.  In this regard, it added up the weekly expenses of people in different categories and measured this against their social welfare income.  It found that the cost of living for a single pensioner is equal to approximately 73% of a couple&rsquo;s living expenses.  Did the Minister read this research on which many agencies are basing their work?  If so, does she accept it?  Also, will she then accept that &euro;7.70 per week is not enough to cope with the costs of living alone for pensioners?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Vincentian Partnership research, which I have read, was a valuable contribution in our consideration of the budget as was the forum which we held with all of the organisations involved.  There has been no increase in the living alone allowance since 1996 because the emphasis has been on increasing basic rates of payment.  With a pot of &euro;515 million, the amount allocated to the social welfare package in Budget 2009, I had to prioritise and to ensure the basic rates increased for everybody.  It was not possible this year to give the same increases as we gave last year.  Were I to target even more specifically groups living alone I would have had to take money from other people and perhaps given some of them less than the anticipated rate of inflation and this would not have been fair either.  In trying to prioritise, I had to ensure the basic rates were increased.  This is the reason for increases such as the &euro;7 per week increase for pensioners.  To give to anybody else would have required me to take this increase from them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>

	<P>I will allow a brief supplementary question from Deputies Enright and Shortall.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is doing a great deal of cherry-picking in that she is taking the line of reports which back up what she is saying and is stating other reports which do not agree with her are &ldquo;interesting&rdquo;.  The Minister needs to take on board what the Vincentian Partnership had to say.  A person who moves from living in a two person household to a one person household is given an increase of &euro;7.70.  The Minister is correct that there has been no increase in this payment since 1996.  It has not been increased as long as this Government has been in office.</P>
        <P>What does the Minister mean when she says she will keep this matter under review?  This to me appears pretty meaningless in a situation where everything but clothes and a little extra fuel must be paid for by one person rather than two.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is being extremely disingenuous in terms of how she is dealing with this question.  I asked her if she accepts the findings of the Vincentian Partnership that the cost of living for a single pensioner is equal to 73% of the cost of living for a couple.  Does the Minister accept this?  If she does, what is her defence of the fact that the living alone allowance has not been increased for the past 12 years?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="303"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The defence is that a social welfare package of &euro;515 million has been provided for under the current budget.  In dividing this money, we had to ensure the basic payments this year were as generous as possible.  To target this in any other way would have required me to take from other recipients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government had 11 other years during which it could have done something in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>

	<P>If the Taoiseach had been in St. Andrew&rsquo;s church, Westland Row, today with Members of the Government he would have appreciated to a far greater extent the hurt and anger felt by the elderly population arising from the Government&rsquo;s shameful decision.  At least 2,000 people heard stories from the elderly of the circumstances in which they now find themselves and what faces them as a consequence of the Government&rsquo;s decision to take <Col N="304"/>back that which they never asked for and to end the principle of universality in regard to medical cards for people on reaching the age of 70 years.  That card was given to them on the basis of what they did for this country when times were not good, how they sustained it during bad times in paying exorbitant rates of tax, for paying in full for their children&rsquo;s education and in accepting in good faith and in trust that this State would look after their medical needs when they passed the age of 70 years having been given a medical card.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and the Government created fear and concern among the elderly who are bruised and offended by what was done.  Since Friday, the Taoiseach has made three attempts to rectify this problem, namely, on &ldquo;Six One&rdquo; news, on Sunday and again today.  I am not sure where the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who introduced this measure, was.  One would have thought that he who introduced it should have been at the conference today.</P>
        <P>Each intervention by the Taoiseach was not on the basis of dealing with the elderly but of quelling the revolt in the backbenches of Fianna F&aacute;il who know this decision was wrong; that this principle should not be breached.  The decision of Government is now recognised by every Fianna F&aacute;il member to have been grievously wrong.  The Taoiseach has expressed regret that this decision was taken and for the incompetent and shameful manner in which this matter was handled.  The Taoiseach will shortly leave for China on important business and I respect that.  The saving as a result of this decision was calculated to be &euro;30 million, half the amount spent on electronic voting machines.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach, before he leaves, prevent the ignominy of thousands of elderly citizens arriving in this city tomorrow to campaign to retain their right to a medical card, a right given to them in good faith by this Government, a trust now breached?</P>

	<P>The announcement made this morning was for the purpose of allaying the concerns of the people involved in this situation.  As I stated, approximately 95% of people who had cards in the past will retain them under the new arrangements.  The core decision and the requirement for a core budget arithmetic to be respected is incorporated in the revised scheme brought forward in the interests of providing a sustainable way forward.  The principle the Deputy enunciates today was not advocated by his party when this measure was introduced.  One can quote from various Deputies in the House on the other side who did not agree with universal entitlement for their own reasons.</P>
        <P>At a time of depleting resources, there is a need to target resources in a whole range of areas in the health sector for people most in need, and this principle comes into very sharp focus in the exceptional economic times in which we live.  Therefore, we have sought in this case to allay public concern.  In political terms, there may be some disappointment if it starts to be allayed as a result of the decision this morning but it is important in the public interest that the concern is allayed.</P><Col N="305"/>
        <P>I have expressed profound regret to any family or individual who, because of the way in which the matter was being portrayed or as a result of our failure to communicate properly, felt they were not going to continue with an entitlement because more than 70% of the people concerned were going to retain their medical entitlement.</P>

	<P>Instead of the graduated response for the others, as per the original proposal, we are now extending medical card eligibility, as I have stated, right up to those who have income of &euro;700 per week for a single person or &euro;1,400 for a couple.  For those reasons, this is a comprehensive response by Government in the face of such concern to allay it, dispel it and deal with it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the budget arithmetic, as I have stated during an earlier session of Leaders&rsquo; Questions, the Fine Gael Party has a budgetary position that does not stand up to any scrutiny at all.</P>

	<P>Sticking to the point that is of particular concern to people today, that is the background I wish to mention.  The fact is we are dealing with that situation comprehensively, providing for savings to be obtained by reason of the fact there will be people who will not be entitled to the card as they are over those eligibility limits on 1 January.  That will provide a saving.</P>
        <P>From next week there will be an agreed common single capitation rate for those over 70s on the medical card scheme, which will provide savings.  Of course, the committee, chaired by the person we have obtained, for the purpose of dealing with drug usage will provide the significant and substantial savings which we believe, on the basis of consultation with GP representative bodies, are available given that total drug spend at the moment is approximately &euro;1.95 billion.  That has almost doubled since 2003.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This does not deal with the fundamental fact.  We are talking about a decision of the Fianna F&aacute;il Government, backed up by the remaining Progressive Democrat and the Green Party, the deputy leader of which stated on KCLR this morning that but for <Col N="306"/>the fact that the Green Party threatened to pull out of Government, this morning&rsquo;s action would not have happened.

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make the point to the Taoiseach again.  Irrespective of the discussion going on around this, the Taoiseach and his Ministers sat down at the Cabinet table and decided to do this and break the principle of universality to give people, by right, a card after 70 years.  This was given to them in good faith by the Government seven years ago as a reward for what they did in sustaining this country and building it up so they could, in their twilight years, look forward to the State looking after their health benefits.</P>
        <P>I understand in some cases even people with a terminal illness are being means tested in respect of their medical cards.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The Deputy should get his facts right.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>That faith and trust has been breached.  The Taoiseach can give a categorical assurance on the following concern if he wishes.  The people are concerned that this will be driven through by the Taoiseach and the people behind him &mdash; they will have a very different view when they go down to the constituencies where they speak like Opposition Deputies on every radio station.  They will be forced tomorrow evening to go up those stairs and turn right or left.</P>

	<P>Before the Taoiseach leaves for China, I ask him to give the House a categorical assurance that when he rams this shameful, disgraceful and callous decision through, he will not follow it with similar decisions on electricity, telephone and travel allowances, which he can do without any legislation.  I ask him for that assurance today.</P>

He can prevent the ignominy of the cowardice of his Government&rsquo;s members when going up those stairs tomorrow evening to vote for a decision they know in their hearts is wrong.  Principle and courage are required and this could have been done in an entirely different way.  The elderly sector should not be segmented into those who have cards and those who do not.</P><Col N="307"/>
        <P>Before leaving for China, will the Taoiseach stand up and say his Government got this wrong, that he is sorry, that he is withdrawing it, will leave the elderly with their cards and the universal principle will apply under Fianna F&aacute;il?  They have said over the years they will look after the sick, the old, the vulnerable, the lonely and the isolated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to the point.  Shouting at me does not get the Deputy anywhere either, by the way.  There are many Deputies on the other side of the House, who at the time <Col N="308"/>of this scheme&rsquo;s introduction and since, are on the record as saying they were not in favour of that universality being provided.</P>

	<P>Yes, but it was brought in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>I am entitled to respond.  When I do so and the Deputy does not like it he speaks of people lecturing.  I am not lecturing the Deputy but I am stating the facts.

	<P>This should be done instead of having them worried, as they are, that their income will creep up above the limits of &euro;700 and &euro;1,400, respectively, for those who are single or married.  They are worried about what will happen if one partner dies and what income will be left to the other partner.  They are worried whether, at some future stage, the Minister will reduce the level of the means test.  If they are not worried about themselves, they are worried about their neighbours who may be in such a position.  Moreover, if the Taoiseach begins to withdraw universal entitlements to medical cards today, they are worried about where he will stop.  Will it be the bus pass next year and something else the following year?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach should clarify a couple of points in respect of his announcement this morning.  He stated that 5% of the single and married over-70s earn in excess of &euro;700 and &euro;1,400, respectively.  What is the basis for this figure?  I do not know whether income distribution figures are available for those who are over 70.  I have never seen or had access to them.  What is the basis for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s assertion in respect of this figure of 5%?  Is it simply off the back of the envelope?</P><Col N="311"/>
        <P>The Taoiseach has stated that from 1 January, there will be no automatic entitlement to a medical card for those who are over 70.  Can the Taoiseach confirm to the House that after 1 January, the income limits may be changed by ministerial order and will not require approval from this House?  What assurance can the Taoiseach give to pensioners that they will not be further reduced if economic conditions continue to be bad?  Will the &euro;700 and &euro;1,400 limits, to which the Taoiseach referred this morning, be index-linked?</P>
        <P>What is the position in respect of someone who has a medical card which states it is valid until 2012?  Will such people keep those medical cards until 2012 or will they be required to make a declaration that their income has gone over the limit?  What happens if someone does not make a declaration that his or her income has exceeded the limit and this is discovered subsequently?  Will they be committing an offence under the Health Act 1970, which I understand to be the position at present?  Will the HSE be entitled to go after such people for the health costs they incurred while holding medical cards in circumstances in which they did not make the declaration?</P>
        <P>Members have heard the figures for the income limit for holding a full medical card.  Are new income limits available for doctor-only cards or for qualification for the &euro;400 subsidy that was announced on budget day?  Have the doctor-only card for the over-70s and the &euro;400 subsidy that was announced on budget day now been taken off the table?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To take the final point first, we have brought forward a different proposal in respect of widening the eligibility criteria in order that more people are entitled to the medical card.  Therefore, the requirement for the GP-only card or the fee payment does not arise.  These were graduated responses in the past when, while preparing the budget, the Government was dealing with a scheme as constituted then and as remains until it hears from Mr. Sullivan, which has a differentiated fee payment system in respect of those who now are over 70 and who have means tested medical cards because they entered the medical card system before turning 70 and those who acquired it simply because of their age, regardless of their means.  As the Deputy is aware, a differentiated system was in place.</P>
        <P>As for the question of the calculations of the Department of Health and Children regarding the numbers who would be eligible in respect of income etc., information is available and the Minister for Health and Children can provide it to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>As for the question regarding the position after 1 January 2009, the Government&rsquo;s statement indicated that there will be a repeal of the Health Act 2001 such that the legal basis for the eligibility for a card is in line with the decision to which the Government has come and which was announced this morning.  I also make the point that new entrants onto the scheme after 1 January will be required to apply for their medical cards under these new arrangements.  Everyone will be notified by way of letter as to what are the new arrangements.  Those who have an income above the limits set out in the letter will be asked to notify the Health Service Executive that they now are over the limit under the new arrangements.  The repeal of the Act, which changes the legal basis upon which the entitlement of the card is provided to everyone, obviously is the legal basis upon which it should be held beyond 1 January, when the new scheme becomes operable.</P>
        <P>On the question of how such a notification process would work, as I said, the Government believes it should be voluntary in the main.  Obviously, administrative data exist which would be available to the Government through its agencies over time to ascertain the manner in which those who are over the limit can be identified.  However, I believe that most people will comply and will notify the Health Service Executive of their situation in the future.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="312"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for offering to make the income information available.  The income distribution on which this decision is based should be published today.</P>
        <P>The formula announced today by the Taoiseach has been designed more to solve his political problem than to settle the worries of pensioners who are concerned about losing their medical cards.   While it may satisfy the more gullible of his backbenchers, I do not believe it will satisfy those pensioners who are rightly concerned about this measure and see what was done last week as an assault on them.  It was a kick in the teeth to those who have given a lifetime of work to this country and who ask for nothing more than to have the peace of mind, through the possession of a medical card, to visit their doctors when feeling unwell in the morning without being obliged to worry about the cost.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is departing on a trade mission to China and, like Deputy Kenny, I wish him well in this regard.  However, he is leaving behind him the biggest budget shambles of any Government in recent times.  When the economy began to experience difficulties, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s big idea for addressing it was to bring forward the date of the budget.  He now is in a position whereby he cannot get the budget that was announced in this Chamber last Tuesday through the House.  One after another, the measures he announced in the budget are falling like nine-pins.  The medical card issue has had to be changed.  The Taoiseach informed the House earlier today that he will be obliged to make changes to the income levy and I believe that, in time, he will be forced to make changes to other measures that were announced in the budget, including the issues of class sizes, cuts in education and some cuts in the social welfare area that Members have not yet addressed.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s budget is a mess.  What is the standing of the Government and what is its authority as the Taoiseach leaves for China in circumstances where he clearly does not have a mandate for what he is doing?  This is not what he or, indeed, anybody presented to the Irish people last June.  He has no mandate to do what he did in last week&rsquo;s budget, whether in regard to the medical cards or other issues.  It is now manifest these measures cannot be put through the House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept for a moment the contention by Deputy Gilmore.  I have already explained the context in which two adjustments have been made in specific elements of the budgetary arrangements passed last week.  The adjustment in respect of medical cards for the over 70s and the willingness to provide an exemption from the income levy for people on low wages retain the essential principles of the decisions as announced, and are being implemented on the basis that the broad budgetary framework applicable in both cases will be maintained.</P>
        <P>It is right that the Government should consider problems which are identified.  In the case of medical cards, confusion and anxiety were caused to large numbers of older people who would not in any event have been affected by the proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Who created them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It proved possible to identify an alternative strategy which retained the essential elements of the decision regarding the granting of medical cards irrespective of income but in a way which confined its impact to the manifestly much better off.  In the case of the income levy, the essential elements and financial impact are being maintained.  It is right, in the context of our relationship with the social partners and the importance to the country of the stability afforded by a new pay agreement, that we should take seriously the concerns expressed by Congress, and that is what we have done.</P><Col N="313"/>
        <P>Difficult and challenging measures will have to be implemented in line with the budget announcements.  It is inevitable in regard to such difficult decisions, which come after a long period of sustained economic growth and substantial increments to benefits for taxpayers in budgets over many years, that the adjustment to the new economic and fiscal environment is difficult.  That is all the more reason for the Government to be sensitive and reflect on issues raised when it is possible to do so within the framework of the budget strategy and arithmetic.  As for other matters, these will be implemented, and the serious situation outlined by the Minister for Finance will be faced with determination in the exceptional times in which we live.</P>

	<P>I refer to another budgetary issue.  Will the T&aacute;naiste tell us if it is proposed to provide sufficient moneys in order that the fair deal scheme can be introduced earlier rather than later?  This is promised legislation that has been published.  The difficulty for health board areas is that the funding is not available.  The families of those entitled to medical cards and who have medical cards are put to the pin of their collars to pay for them in nursing homes.  Will the Minister introduce a supplementary budget to ensure this happens?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to topical issues, two Bills on which the T&aacute;naiste might indicate her intentions to the House.  One is the legislation to clarify and update the provisions relating to the eligibility for health and personal social services, No. 54.  It looks like a suitable Bill for debate in the House in the present circumstances and climate.  It might provide an opportunity for the Minister to provide clarity on the situation that is unfolding.</P><Col N="318"/>
        <P>The financial services miscellaneous provisions Bill will transfer ministerial responsibility for building societies from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Minister for Finance to provide for various other miscellaneous amendments.  Both Bills are topical and important.  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate if these will be introduced earlier than expected?  Otherwise they will have to be amended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

	<P>When is it expected that the public transport regulation Bill will be published?  Regarding reform of the Competition Act, Mr. Prasifka says he cannot order a study of any industry such as the liquid fuels market because it would prejudice a court case.  Is the T&aacute;naiste in favour of giving the Competition Authority the powers that seem to be necessary?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The public transport legislation will be taken next year.  Regarding the Competition Act, I must take into consideration all the legalities before I produce legislation.

	<P>When this House adjourned last week we anticipated some speculation over the weekend but I am sure that neither the Ceann Comhairle nor I, nor the House in general, fully anticipated and appreciated the extent of that speculation and to where it would lead.</P>
        <P>As we sat in this Chamber last Thursday evening, when poor Deputy McGrath and others were wondering what their next move might be, Deputy Behan made his move and decided to set them all offside.  The offside flag went up and it was too late at that stage for anybody else to move.  I am sorry they were consigned to dry dock in such a way.  After all, it is only a few short days since all the Government backbenchers and supporters on the benches opposite stood up with one accord and applauded the budget.  It was an extraordinary performance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>For which they got a standing ovation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>A standing ovation that lasted for seven minutes.  I wondered what all the cheering was about because there was nothing in the budget about which to cheer.  There was nothing in it that was reassuring and nothing for elderly people who were about to have their medical cards withdrawn.  There was nothing to cheer about so I do not know why the people across the House were cheering.  There was nothing for the younger people because <Col N="320"/>a levy was imposed across the board, right down to those on a basic minimum wage.  What prompted the backbenchers to react in that hysterical fashion in the course of the budget debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a case of turkeys and Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe this was the first time such a thing happened.  The Ceann Comhairle, who is an experienced Member of this House, will appreciate that more than anybody else.  Turkeys have been known to approach Christmas with a certain amount of trepidation in the past but on this occasion there was none of that.  Children and the mothers of children&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I never spoke to turkeys.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be a good idea to try to have an interview with them, in any event.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Let us examine the other reasons the Government backbenchers might have cheered.  What about the mothers of children who are to have their child benefit removed when their children reach 18 years of age?  This is at a time when education is under pressure and, although higher education grants remain the same, registration fees have gone up.  Income thresholds have not been lifted sufficiently to cater for the situations that now arise.  Therefore, it could not have been the mothers of children or the children on whose behalf the Government backbenchers reacted with such enthusiasm.</P>
        <P>I was amazed, and I could see the incredulity on the face of the Ceann Comhairle because I am sure he, too, never saw anything like that in his time in the House.  It was definitely the first time.  As was said long ago in a poem: &ldquo;Even the ranks of Tuscany could scarce forbear to cheer&rdquo;.  I just do not know why they cheered.  All I can conclude is that the Government backbenchers were delirious at the time.  They were completely taken over by a kind of euphoria, an upsurge and a welling up in their hearts and minds, because it was a great day.</P>
        <P>However, nothing could have been further from the truth.  As I said the other evening, these events did not start during the past week, month, six months or the past two or three years.  They began during the past eight years.  Do we remember all the things that were said to us and about us?  We were told the fundamentals were good and if anybody suggested that the economy was going wrong, that person was wrong, hysterical and scaremongering.  That person was unpatriotic and talking down the economy.</P>
        <P>What was happening across the floor of the House?  Why did somebody on that side not ask the obvious question about whether everything was really going all right?  Was it right to have 120% and 130% mortgages for first-time buyers or for any buyer?  Was it right to have the degree of investment and speculation in the construction industry that was clearly taking place?  Why was benchmarking introduced all those years ago?  The answer is simple &mdash; the pay agreement entered into a year or 18 months before had gone done the tubes.  The cost of living had caught up with everybody and the only thing to do was to find some way of getting some money to assuage the general unease in the minds and hearts of the public at that particular time.  It was an appalling decision but it was not the decision itself that was wrong, but the reasons for which it had to be taken.  Those reasons should have been questioned at that time but were not.</P>
        <P>Members on the Opposition benches raised those issues but were told that we were scaremongering, that we had no imagination, that this was a new type of economic thinking and that <Col N="321"/>all was bound to be fine.  Were we not the strongest and richest country in the world and one of the most influential?  What a load of rubbish that was.  Surely we can cop ourselves on and not go on with this type of delusional nonsense in the future.</P>
        <P>As to those Government backbenchers who rose up last week, as if in rebellion, and applauded and stomped their feet loudly to the tune of the conclusion of the budget speech, I presume they were not taking responsibility for what had happened.  However, somebody, somewhere, must take that responsibility.  It is important in the country&rsquo;s interests that somebody takes that responsibility and does so soon.  It is no good if the Government barracks the Opposition and complains that its members are not realistic, or if it suggests that the Opposition has been at fault in some way.  The Opposition&rsquo;s job is, as always, to challenge the Government, to prosecute it and to make sure that we stand up for the people outside the House and raise their concerns and questions even before they are raised in the public arena.  That is the important thing, as the Ceann Comhairle will know well.</P>
        <P>It was very sad that nobody wanted to take responsibility.  Everything in the garden was rosy and there was nothing but the smell of roses in the air as the Government and the country careered in a particular direction.  From my knowledge, and from my time in this House, I cannot believe that we have got to where we are nor the means by which we got here without any recognition on the other side of the House as to what was happening.  The problem is of so great a magnitude.</P>
        <P>The other thing that annoys me, as I am sure it annoys the Ceann Comhairle and other Members of the House, is the suggestion that the problem was imported, that international currency fluctuations caused it all.  This is not the case because 95% of the problem originated in this country and was within the ambit of Government, the Financial Regulator, the banking system and the Central Bank to control.  It was well within their reach had they wished to control it, but nobody wanted to.  It was as if there would be no tomorrow, as if everybody said: &ldquo;This is great, we are going to have a really great time.&rdquo;  The feel good factor began to break out all over, but that did not last.</P>
        <P>At this juncture, as we review the likely impact of this budget on the economy and as Deputies Enda Kenny, Richard Bruton, Eamon Gilmore and others suggest, it looks as if this is only a temporary bandage put on the economy to stop it from rolling over the cliff.  All the impositions on the public are there merely to punish the people but the question is, for what are they being punished?  They were not responsible for what has happened but they are about to be punished.  Unfortunately, ordinary members of the public are about to be punished left, right and centre for the actions of the Government and the banking system.  Despite having had no hand, act or part in the fiasco, they will carry responsibility for wrongdoing in the banking sector.</P>

	<P>It is a good job the tent at Ballybrit has been closed because it would have been great fun if it had been open this week.</P>
        <P>It is grossly unfair that children, people aged over 70 years and those on hospital waiting lists will be punished.  On the issue of hospitals and the delivery of health services, I am sick to the back teeth of listening to the Minister for Health and Children tell us that it is economically preferable to take this or that approach.  I am also sick of hearing about centres of excellence and long waiting times for services.  What has gone wrong with the delivery of health services for members of the public?  In recent weeks, I had occasion to speak to a 95 year old man who <Col N="322"/>had to sit on a chair for 24 hours before receiving attention in a well known Dublin hospital.  That is how good health services are being delivered.</P>
        <P>We do not need rocket science but simply someone to get a grip and do something to address the glaring faults in the system.  When the Government decides to address the problem in our health services it must take a meaningful, humane approach which recognises the need to provide services for people when they are vulnerable.  We do not need a conveyor belt system under which people receive treatment having waited for up to four years.</P>
        <P>I never understood the reason the issue of public housing was included in partnership negotiations seven, eight or ten years ago.    Housing has nothing to do with partnership and should not have been dragged from the public arena into the partnership process where those involved are not accustomed to dealing with the issue.  A range of ideas was trotted out concerning the way in which the housing sector would develop.  We were told, for example, the Irish tradition of home ownership was a whimsical notion about which we should not be concerned as people all over the world were happy to rent their homes.  Moreover, everybody would have access to housing through the rental system.  As I predicted at the time, renting soon became as expensive as buying and those who were renting were paying the equivalent of a mortgage in any event.  I could not understand the logic of the original argument put forward by some of those involved in the property sector, members of the Government and others who should have known better.</P>
        <P>It is appalling that a generation of young people has been consigned to renting property in a market which is being artificially propped up.  These young people are destined to remain in this market until such time as prices fall and come within their reach.  If some people have their way, however, prices will not fall and they will swing in the market for another five or six years.  The Government failed the younger generation by completely ignoring their housing needs.  To fund their housing needs people found it necessary to borrow sums for 45 and 50 years or secure loans of 120% of the price of the property.  Agencies will deny such loans were provided even though 150% loans were provided in some cases, as becomes clear when one considers that on some sites property prices increased by up to &euro;50,000 within a 12-hour period.  The Government stands indicted of failing to attempt to deliver to this sector.</P>
        <P>In recent years, Government Deputies have loudly boasted about the large increases in social welfare payments awarded in budgets.  They scathingly refer to the last Social Welfare Act introduced by the former Minister for Social Welfare, Mr. Proinsias De Rossa.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan should be ashamed to even raise the issue, given that the then Minister, Mr. De Rossa, increased social welfare payments by just &pound;1.50 per week. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Deputy Kennedy has piped up.  After ten years of what is alleged to have been the greatest era of development in the history of the State, the Government has awarded a 3% increase in social welfare payments, which is equivalent to the rate of increase introduced by Mr. De Rossa in 1997 when there was good reason to limit it.  Government Deputies who in recent years boasted that the Government was acting like Santa Claus should have known this day was approaching because the relevant information was available to them.  </P>
        <P>When the Taoiseach informed the House that the Opposition promised A, B and C during the most recent general election campaign, he failed to mention that the Government had all the facts and figures at its disposal.  It had inside information whereas the Opposition had second-hand information.  The Government&rsquo;s intention was clearly to get past the general election and it succeeded using a stroke of genius.  The figures available at the time were misleading and continued to be misleading until a couple of weeks ago.  Even today, the Opposition cannot <Col N="323"/>be certain that the information it receives is accurate.  The Minister for Finance was unable to assure the House about the veracity of information on the banking system and is unlikely to be able to do so in the next couple of weeks.  However, that information will emerge in time.</P>
        <P>Is it not appalling that after the so-called Celtic tiger era our schools continue to have prefabricated structures in which, in some cases, the parents and grandparents of the current generation of school children were educated.  After ten years of the Celtic tiger roaring in the concrete jungle, the Government has nothing more to offer young children than the same prefabricated structures and overcrowded classes.  This is in direct conflict with the promises made by Government parties during and in the aftermath of the general election campaign.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, for reasons of time I am unable to discuss the motions as they relate to other Departments.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom labhairt ar an mbuis&eacute;ad t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak on this important budget at a critical time for the country&rsquo;s finances.  We all know the budget was introduced in the context of a severe economic downturn, with income tax revenues down &euro;6.5 billion in the current year.  We must take cognisance of this fact.</P>
        <P>While my colleagues and I agree that last week was difficult for backbench Deputies, I am greatly relieved by this morning&rsquo;s decision to change the budget measures on medical cards.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;especially during the general election. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the measures that have been announced, more than 95% of deserving people will retain their medical cards.  The new income thresholds widen the net enormously to take into account the huge proportion of our elderly who deserve our support and have always got it.  Under the new arrangements, single people can now earn up to &euro;700 a week, equating to &euro;36,500 in a year.  That excludes any savings they may have, and they still retain their medical card.  Married couples can now earn up to &euro;1,400 per week, equivalent to &euro;73,000 per annum, again excluding their savings.  For those who might not qualify under those income limits, there is the discretionary scheme, which has always been in place for those with severe medical needs and costs. </P>
        <P>The newly announced system is more straightforward, in my view, and I sincerely hope today&rsquo;s developments will reduce the anxiety felt by members of the public in the past week.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has long looked after the interests of the elderly, more than any other party in this House.  I thought it interesting that our Fine Gael colleague from Kildare was talking about the derisory figure of &pound;1.40 that the revered MEP, Mr. Proinsias de Rossa, gave when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  That was a severe embarrassment to Fine Gael and the Labour Party and the less said from that side of the House, the better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should talk about the 1920s now. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I remind our colleagues in Opposition that not alone has the Minister increased the figure by &euro;7 this year, but it is now &euro;230 per week on top of all the other free items senior citizens are given.  We should recognise that Fianna F&aacute;il, in successive <Col N="324"/>Governments over the last number of years, has substantially increased the benefits to our senior citizens.  I challenge anybody from Fine Gael and Labour to dispute that fact.</P>
        <P>In lobbying hard last week for the changes to the medical card, I was conscious of the enormous number of views being expressed to me and, indeed, to all Deputies.  As a Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher I broadly welcome the changes now made to the medical card.</P>

	<P>I certainly made my views known on the matter and believe that today&rsquo;s announcement has resolved the concerns of the vast majority of the people.  We now have a much more equitable solution.  As a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy and a life-long supporter of my party, it is my duty to represent the views of close to 11,000 people who gave me their first preferences in the general election of May 2007.  I thank them for that and had no compunction in expressing their concerns to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children.  I am relieved that my representations and those of my backbench colleagues have helped to resolve the situation.  The measures announced this morning are fair and equitable and will achieve what the Government was attempting to do, in the first place, that is, to save the State a substantial amount of money. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I am delighted that the Government is to take this issue to the GPs.  I mentioned this last week, and as we know Deputy Reilly went berserk when I suggested that the IMO had a role to play.  I certainly believe that was always the way we should go to get better value on behalf of the taxpayers of this State, from the IMO.  Quite clearly, the figures were very much in its members&rsquo; favour.  It was good to hear a doctor on last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; agree that the average number of visits per patient is six, when they are getting paid for up to 13 visits per year.  A 50% saving is badly needed there and the Government is to be congratulated on those negotiations.  I look forward to the result of this consultation and I have faith in the Government to make the required savings by addressing the deal with the GPs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to take a moment to acknowledge the contribution of my constituency colleague, Deputy James Reilly who, as a revered former section head of the IMO, was responsible for the medical gold card scheme, which is now emerging as a major expense to the Government.  I ask, specifically, as I did last week, whether he will give his blessing to his former GP colleagues in the IMO voluntarily reducing the costs to the Government of treating these elderly medical card holders.  We should recall Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s comments as regards the universality of the scheme when it was originally announced.  I shall quote from some of his comments when he was chairman of the GP section of the IMO.  He said he &ldquo;would not like to see cards given out to those who could afford golf clubs&rdquo;.  I assume he was talking about higher subscription golf clubs.  In 2001 he said he &ldquo;would not like to see [medical] cards given out to senior civil servants, retired or otherwise, judges, Ministers, high-powered property tycoons, hospital consultants...&rdquo;.  Equally, I want to remind him of an article, dated 16 December 2007, in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, at which stage he was a D&aacute;il Deputy and not acting under his previous guise as a chairman of the IMO&rsquo;s  GP section.  In the second last paragraph of the article written by Aileen O&rsquo;Meara, Deputy Reilly is quoted as saying he &ldquo;does not want millionaire over-70s to be given cards&rdquo;.  I regard his attitude and that of Fine Gael on the issue of giving medical cards to millionaire over-70s to be absolutely hypocritical.  It is disgusting how someone such as Deputy Reilly can somersault in his attitudes for the sake of sheer naked political opportunism.  I hope he will address the issue and allude to that fact when he speaks tonight, as I presume he will, as spokesman for Fine Gael, on the Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  I should like to hear his justification as regards what he believes in 2008, when this country has severe financial <Col N="325"/>constraints compared to 2001-02 when it was trading well and garnering a good deal of taxable income.  I want him to answer those queries because I believe that he, and his colleagues in Fine Gael, have been hypocritical.  Moving on&mdash;&mdash;</P><P />

	<P>The Deputy should go on worrying about himself and his party and not about Fine Gael. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael is confusing the public and deliberately misconstruing the situation.  That is the only point I am making. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, the Deputy got that from the script writer.   Fianna F&aacute;il wrecked the country in 1977 and 1981 and now it is wrecking it again. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to deal with measures to bridge the gap between the State&rsquo;s current income and expected revenue.  Some &euro;3 billion is needed to run the country for the next year, and there is no point in denying it or rewriting history.  No more than previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administrations, Fine Gael-Labour Governments were equally bad in terms of increasing the national debt and creating problems.  We need money now and the general public recognises the next two or three years will be difficult and is willing to make its contribution.  However, matters are not helped when people on the other side say that extra taxation is not needed.  I do not pretend that I am an economist, but I have been a businessman and so know something about it.  Eminent economists argue that if the Fine Gael proposals were implemented, we should be borrowing an extra &euro;4 billion on top of what the Government is planning.  We should recognise that our GDP will decline by 1.5% next year and a further decline is on the cards for the following year.  We know that &euro;2 billion of this money will come from taxation measures and a further &euro;1 billion will be garnered from savings on public spending.  Everyone in the House expects savings across the public service.  We have all had difficulties, whether with the HSE or other bodies.  I welcome the fact the Government will tackle this problem.</P>
        <P>Income from taxation will primarily come from the 1% income levy.  That levy is fair and equitable.  However, I welcome today&rsquo;s confirmation by the Taoiseach that those on lower incomes will be excluded from this.  Higher earners, those earning over &euro;250,000 per annum, should pay a higher figure than the 2%.  I suggest 2.5% or 3%.  I hope when the Minister brings forward the Finance Bill, he might incorporate that because higher earners have done well out of this country, they are not afraid to pay up and they are willing to make their contribution.</P>
        <P>I mentioned old age pensioners earlier.  The &euro;7 increase, bringing the pension to &euro;230 per week, is important.  Most of the people I have met over the past number of years recognise that they have been well treated.  They are quite happy with the increases they have been getting year on year.  From my discussions with people,  I believe they are happy they are getting an extra &euro;7 in the coming year considering the state of the public finances.  They recognise that as much as the rest of us do.</P>
        <P>The levies will certainly pay for the 5% increase in the mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers.  That is a very important facet.  These people need help in these difficult times and it will allow them to claim up to &euro;416 per month which is significant.</P>
        <P>I am particularly pleased with the transportation issues.  Deputy Broughan will agree with me in regard to metro north which will benefit his constituency, even though it does not run through it.  The area north of the Liffey, including Meath and south Louth, needs a public transportation system comparable to the Luas on the southside.  We need an efficient and cost-<Col N="326"/>effective method of public transport.  Every morning the M1 motorway coming into Dublin city is clogged up.  We need to take those 20,000 cars off the road for future sustainability, to reduce CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, etc.  All the sceptics, including Deputy Broughan, were half hoping that metro north would not be in this year&rsquo;s programme.  Deputy Broughan could have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am only stating the facts.  Deputy Broughan and his colleagues would have berated the Minister if he had excluded metro north.  It is in this programme.  I hope those opposite will acknowledge that because when I read the <i>Northside People</i> and see Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s comments about metro north, sometimes I want to cringe and tell the people what he says at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about metro west and the western rail corridor?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>Metro west will follow.  Let us get metro north to the airport so that metro west can come about.  Metro west will happen when public finances allow.  Again, it is badly needed.  Deputy Broughan knows Transport 21 is a substantial &euro;34 billion programme.  Most of it is intact.  Many of the items in Transport 21 have been delivered.  </P>
        <P>I refer to our new roadway structure.  One can drive from Dublin to Cork, from Dublin to Galway and from Dublin to Sligo.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>We will come to the buses.  Let us deal with Transport 21 about which Deputy Broughan is so sceptical.  We have delivered on the vast majority of the road programme in recent years ahead of time and ahead of budget. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kennedy must be joking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Barrett should look at the record.  I am talking about recent projects coming in ahead of budget and ahead of schedule.  That is a fact.  If he doubts it, the Deputy should look at the record.  The NRA will confirm that and I am sure Deputy Broughan will do so too because he asked the NRA quite recently about its programmes. </P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kennedy must never travel on the N73.</P>

	<P>I travel on as many roads as Deputy Broughan.  I had the pleasure of driving from Galway to Dublin recently in two and a half hours and it did not involve breaking the speed limit.  That is indicative of the progress we are making.</P>
        <P>In regard to education issues, we all regret an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio but we must live with the reality of the financial constraints.  I listened to the Fine Gael Deputy from Kildare North talk about education.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>He never mentioned the 19,000 extra teachers and special needs assistants who have been put into our schools in the past three to four years.  He did not even have the guts to admit that there has been a substantial building programme, including in Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s constituency and in my constituency of Dublin North.  Major news schools have been announced and, more important, built in the past number of years.  Does Deputy Broughan want me to name them?  There are extra schools in Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Swords and Donabate.  Does Deputy Broughan want me to name the schools in Dublin North-East?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kennedy should not forget the Naul.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will leave Deputy Broughan to deal with Dublin North-East.  There has been a substantial programme.  One must be realistic in terms of what we can do at this point.</P>
        <P>In regard to class sizes, there are exceptions to every rule and I will focus, in particular, on schools with large numbers of foreign national pupils in their midst whose command of English is not too good.  We need to put extra language teachers into those schools and I will ask the Minister to deal with that issue in a very flexible and considerate manner.</P>
        <P>We want to reduce numbers going forward and as money permits.  We have good school buildings and a teacher-pupil ratio of 28:1.  Most of us in this House went to schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of 35:1 or 40:1, or at least I certainly did and it did not do me any harm.  There were 35 pupils in my children&rsquo;s classes and they all went to college and got degrees, masters&rsquo; degrees, etc., which I did not.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the pupil-teacher ratio is a major problem.  We have quality teachers and I trust them to deliver a good education, as they have done over the years.  That is our hope.  The odd school will have problems and I recognise that it should be helped.  However, for the next couple of years, we will live with a pupil-teacher ratio of 28:1.  I do not believe there should be any arguments in that regard.</P>
        <P>As a Deputy for Dublin North, one of the emerging locations for new business and research and development, I welcome the tax credits which the Minister has introduced in the budget.  A sum of &euro;335 million has been provided for research and development.  That makes Ireland competitive in the global knowledge economy and it is an increase of 3% on last year, which is very welcome.  When one considers that the current budget is nine times the investment we made in 2000, it is substantial and recognises the role the Government sees for business.   I wish the Taoiseach and the business delegation travelling to China well in their efforts to bring business and badly needed jobs to our country.  We need to encourage as many overseas companies as possible to set up research facilities on these shores.</P>

	<P>I realise Deputy Broughan suffers slight embarrassment at the progress the country has made under Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  I will not give out to him for barracking, because that is all he can do.  I am sure he will not have too much to say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will continue with my speech if the Deputy does not mind, but if I have time, I will revert to that later.</P><Col N="328"/>
        <P>At this point in time, it was necessary to have a tough budget.  It is in the country&rsquo;s interest that we get our public finances back in order and bring competitiveness back into business.  We must use every opportunity to educate the public about the current downturn and to warn them that the high expectations of the past must be tempered and lowered.  The public should not be conned into believing that everything is rosy in the garden and that the Opposition would deal with the current situation better.  Economists have told us that if the Fine Gael proposals enunciated in recent weeks were adopted, we would need to borrow an extra &euro;4 billion.  One can imagine the impact that would have on our economy, on jobs, on taxpayers and our GP cards.</P>
        <P>Sacrifice is needed from all sections of society to maintain stability so that we will be in a position, when the global economy improves, to reintegrate our aims into Government policies and future budgets.  In 1987, when the country suffered certain financial constraints, the Minister of the day, Ray MacSharry, took tough decisions.  At the time, the people felt the measures taken were tough, but hindsight proved the decisions taken to be correct.  It was no different in 2004 when once again tough decisions had to be made.  Tough decisions were made then in the national interest.</P>
        <P>As we discuss this 2009 budget, I believe we need to make tough decisions.  We need to tell the public in clear, simple language the difficulties we have with our finances.  We are &euro;6.5 billion down this year and expect to be &euro;9 billion down next year.  This must be stated clearly so that the public understands why we must take tough decisions in the budget.  If we do not, we will find great difficulty in getting ourselves back on track and being ready for the upturn in 2011.</P>
        <P>With regard to the current financial situation, it must be recognised that Ireland is not the only country suffering a downturn.  The whole world has gone through turmoil.  There is a downturn in the global economy.  We are aware of the situation with regard to the US banks and sub-prime lending and the difficulties it caused for the US, us, our neighbours in Britain and our European counterparts.  We did not bring that upon ourselves.  It was foisted upon us.  Opposition spokespersons have commented that Ireland brought these troubles on itself, but our banks were not immune from the problem in the United States.</P>
        <P>Ireland showed great leadership in bringing forward its bank bail-out legislation.  We were the first to step in and say we would guarantee the savings of depositors.  That was the right decision.  It was done in the interest of stability and we got stability because of taking that decision.  It is interesting that our European counterparts, some of whom criticised our decision at the time, have said it was the right way to go.</P>

When the Labour Party has time to reflect on what it has done, it will regret it.  The country needed the Labour Party members to stand up and be counted, but they failed to do that.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this budget.  The budget should be judged in terms of its effects in a particular context.  It was brought forward for a particular reason, to respond to international economic circumstances which had changed.  While those who prepared the budget have used these external circumstances as a kind of apologia for their actions, there is no doubt but that there has been a crisis in fiscal terms here since 2006.</P>
        <P>The reason I say the crisis has been with us since 2006 is because I want to talk about real economics.  In 2006, our imports exceeded exports.   Without being partisan about it, between 1995 and 2000 the economy performed well in terms of growth, which was sustained by export growth.  Exports then flattened out and dipped in 2006 after which imports exceeded exports resulting in a serious balance of payments problem.  It is not accidental that in approximately January 2007 property prices reached their peak.  There was an international bubble and within that a home-grown bubble based particularly on property speculation and also fed by a series of instruments that could be regarded as virtual financial products.  Some people suggest these were invented in the United States and sub-prime lending spread through the international <Col N="330"/>system and made its way into the Irish banks.  I do not accept that excuse.  There were serious failings in regulation by the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.</P>
        <P>Those responsible for economic policy promoted the kind of property speculation we had.  In time, people will look back at the McCreevy budgets as the most irresponsible of all time in being totally indiscriminate in the consequences created by tax breaks.  While there was an international atmosphere, there is also that for which we have responsibility.  This was brought home to me very dramatically when I was in Westland Row church this morning looking at frail elderly people coming up to stand behind a microphone to state they had worked all their lives.  In some cases, women said they had retired from the Civil Service and were, therefore, in a particularly vulnerable pension position.  They might have got a lump sum and reared their children.  How are they now to purchase on a private market the health security people want?</P>
        <P>I have been thinking about what is at stake here.  It is the loss of citizenship by the Government action.  The previous Taoiseach announced some kind of campaign which was supposed to be about citizenship, but turned into a lacklustre appeal for more volunteerism.  It was not citizenship in any sense.  Citizenship is about inclusion.  Amartya Sen, the Nobel laureate in economics, once said that the purpose of economics was &ldquo;the ability to appear in public without shame&rdquo;.  Genuine citizenship is about inclusion and that is the debate about universalism.  We make universal provision for those who want to come in and out of citizen participation in their society.  This is why we should have universal provision for children in education, etc., in order to give all citizens a chance to be able to participate in society without shame and to be able to earn a living.  There is a debate in philosophy that I cannot deal with in 15 minutes as to whether this should be based on capabilities.</P>
        <P>At the other end, people want security.  Having spent their lives working, they want to be assured.  While they are not looking for material benefits, they want to know, if they have need or are ill, that they would be able to have access.  Those who came to Westland Row this morning wanted to be secure in regard to health needs.  Apart from everything else, this makes practical sense.  On average, a person lives for three years after going into a nursing home.  I was a sociologist in another life.  The proportion of people who want to spend their final years in their own home has never sunk below 80% in any survey.  People want to be at home.  While some of people never used them, the knowledge that if they felt unwell they could use their medical cards and go to a pharmacy with which they had a relationship served as a kind of instrument of security.</P>
        <P>These two ends of the spectrum are represented by the elderly and children in education.  It is a pity that the previous speaker is not here.  A woman spoke about the school in which she works in Tallaght.  That school, in which almost 50% of the children have difficulty with English, is losing two language teachers.  Nobody wants that to happen and it should not happen.  However, there is a great laziness about this budget.  When I was a Minister, the message would come from the Department of Finance that I needed to prepare my budget on a no-change basis.  The Department of Finance would always come back for the second round in which it suggested it needed a cut of a particular percentage.  This has all the marks of that lazy indiscriminate thinking with no flexibility or discretion for, for example, the school that with half its pupils&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should allow Deputy Higgins to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will return to it.  If there is flexibility in that case, I welcome it.  However, how can it be progressive to increase class sizes?  One might say that this is what we can afford.  The Minister of State can disagree with me if he wishes, but I want to be practical about the matter.  If the Government wanted to have some kind of citizenship that would be positive, it would have put a rights ring around certain categories of the population &mdash; children in education and the elderly.  It would have used education for this reason.  If I accepted the Minister of State&rsquo;s logic, young people are going into an economic space where it will be far more difficult to get employment.  It will be more insecure employment and they will change jobs far more often during their lives.  Therefore, they will need more personal, social and professional skills.  It makes sense to invest in education.  For those who are losing their jobs, it makes sense to reduce the obstacles on the social welfare side to enable people to get back to education.  That did not happen.  It also made sense to have upskilling.  There is a series of things I could mention.  The budget fell indiscriminately on an entire category of people.</P>
        <P>It is very interesting to give an example of an uncaring bureaucracy in my limited time.  The elderly are not getting a hit for the first time.  Regarding the handover of responsibility for the special housing aid for the elderly scheme from the HSE to local authorities, I was informed on 19 September 2008 about the western side of things.  Initially the local authorities claimed to be responsible for the physical side of adapting a house, but nothing else to do with elderly care.  The HSE letter stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">During these meetings we outlined the number of staff involved in administering the scheme, methods used by us in assessing the applications?  We informed them that we received 468 applications in 2008 of which 100 are for the City?  There are 387 applications outstanding.  We also explained that our current financial resources have been committed for 2008.  Additionally we provided details of our Community Employment schemes.  [It wanted to maintain them.]</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Both Local Authorities explained that they currently have no funds available to administer the scheme and would not be in a position to accept any of our applications.  In fact, Galway County Council asked us to accept 270/280 applications from them.  This was refused in view of the current pressures.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">At present we have ceased accepting all Applications and are referring applicants to Galway City and County Councils even though we are aware that they do not have the resources available.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The letter is signed by the local HSE representative.  What way is that to treat elderly people at the very bottom of the pile?  What did these people want?  They wanted a downstairs toilet.  They wanted to be able to wash themselves &mdash; basic requirements.  The issue of the medical card was just a symptom of how elderly people are not regarded as a category of citizens that should be ring-fenced in terms of rights for the sake of security for the elderly.  The same is true of the other end.  Irrespective of the government in power, it should be investing in education not just for the economy, but also to have a kind of citizenship that is caring, has values of inclusion, avoids all of the different attacks we have seen on the social fabric and so forth.  The budget missed all that.</P>
     
        <P>I refer to the admissions that have been made.  President Sarkozy referred to the necessity for another Bretton Woods Agreement to stabilise international finance.  The reality is that <Col N="332"/>what he is not saying is that the old game has failed.  Hundreds of economists have written subscribing to the liberal model of the Washington consensus that emanated in the University of Chicago where a tower will be erected shortly to Milton Friedman.  That model has brought the world to its knees financially to a point rather like that addressed by John Maynard Keynes in his time.  There is need for a new international institution to stand alongside the IMF and the World Bank but it should deal with hot money, speculative money and the drugs money flowing through the system and it should be built on a social model.</P>
         <P>The future of politics, which is very interesting, is between those in the Cato Institute who argue that the last thing they want is regulation and those who want regulation to achieve a social economy.  The beauty of Europe in its time was that we might have had a region with a set of economies that would advance the social model and stand against the other regions that wanted unregulated labour markets and to drive social protection down, which is important.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Those of us who have been involved in development aid and so on visit and observe countries now and again.  At the same time speculation was taking place in the international economy, neat agglomerations were managing to construct conditions of oligopoly and monopoly.  I attended the world hunger meeting in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham last week.  In the food sector, five companies control 90% of the world&rsquo;s grain trade, six companies control 80% of the world&rsquo;s pesticide market, three companies control 85% of the world&rsquo;s team market, two companies control 50% of the world trade in bananas, three companies control 80% of the confectionery market and, most important, the media have been monopolised.  We have, therefore, a bad economic model internationally, which has failed, compliant economists who are stuck with one model and media, which are monopolised such that through Fox Television and Berlusconi one will hear the same failed song all the time.</P>
        <P>World poverty will result.  When one comes to the quality of the debate about economics domestically, people think it is a casual consequence that there are such things as good times and bad times.  Good times mean there is no difference between a time as far back as 2001-02 when the Government was exporting and sustaining an economic growth rate and the current time in which exports have disappeared and become expensive for a number of reasons.  The Government continued to claim a growth rate when it was revaluing the property base of the entire country and when, in five budgets in a row, it transferred benefits worth hundreds of millions of euro to people to continue the speculative madness that put housing out of the reach of ordinary people but created vast personal fortunes.</P>
        <P>I refer to measures that could have been taken and, in particular, one that has not been mentioned so far.  With regard to multiple house ownership, the person who has acquired an additional house will be charged &euro;200 and an employee who is provided with a parking space by his or her employer will be also charged &euro;200.  Why not increase the charge for a second house to &euro;400 and make it geometric for the third, fourth and fifth houses until over a five-year period an owner of seven or eight houses would face a penalty of 60% or 70% if necessary?  That would release housing units into the market and reduce their price, thereby helping people in the housing market and it would have been a hell of a lot better than saying to those who tore the heart out of the economy on a speculative basis, &ldquo;Is there anything we can give you now to keep you in business?&rdquo;  While the problem emanated abroad, we had our own problem and it was dealt with disgracefully.  We must not allow the old and the young to carry the burden of reconstruction.  That must fall on those who created the problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Budget 2009 is a watershed, which has shown the true colours of this Fianna F&aacute;il-dominated Government.  It is ironic that during the weeks when we bailed out some of the fattest cat bankers, low and middle income families, senior citizens and children <Col N="333"/>were forced to carry the can for the mistakes of Governments over the past 11 years, as my colleague outlined.  I echo my party leader&rsquo;s comment that the Government has no mandate to attack senior citizens, children and low income workers in the way it has, given the change in Government from that which managed to sneak in June 2007 to the three amigos &mdash; the two Brians and the T&aacute;naiste &mdash; who are dominating the current Government.  The solution to proceed, given the severity of the difficulties faced by the country, is to call a general election.  If the Government has confidence in its proposals, we should have a general election as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I refer to the many savage cutbacks, which my colleague, Deputy Shortall, called 30 treacherous cuts in the social welfare budget.  One of the meanest relates to the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Many thousands of young workers are facing unemployment for the first time and the Government made the conditions for accessing this benefit more difficult in a most mean-spirited move.  The 1% levy, as originally promulgated, was an amazing attack on low income workers, particularly those on the minimum wage.  The thresholds that have been mentioned in the context of amending it are too low given the struggles of low paid workers.</P>
        <P>Like all other Members, I have been inundated with telephone calls and e-mails.  The first person who visited my clinic last Saturday was a 94 year old senior citizen who was desperately upset that a Government he supported at times in the past had reneged on its commitment to senior citizens.  The fear felt by him and 350,000 other senior citizens last week can only be experienced first hand by speaking to them, as I hope Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Members will do tomorrow when we have the opportunity to meet tens of thousands of them outside Leinster House.</P>
        <P>The education cutbacks are equally harsh and every time we turn around, another is discovered.  For example, a number of classes in St. Colmcille&rsquo;s school in Donaghmede will have 43 children next year.  St. Peter and Paul&rsquo;s school in Baldoyle has campaigned for a lower pupil-teacher ratio and most of the children will learn in classes of well over 30 next year.  The same will apply in the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s constituency of Cork North-Central and throughout the State.</P>
        <P>We feel a little let down.  Before last year&rsquo;s general election the INTO general secretary, Mr. John Carr, was dancing around on a platform with the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, during a love-in at the trade union&rsquo;s annual conference.  I presume there was a feeling the Government had made solemn commitments to the teaching profession, but 15 months later they are totally in shreds.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  How could such a close relationship have come apart so quickly?</P>
        <P>The key characteristic of the transport budget is commuters have been hammered right, left and centre through the increase in excise duty on petrol by 8 cent a litre from budget night and the increase in motor taxation of 4% on cars with an engine capacity of less than 2.5 litres and 5% for those with a higher engine capacity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Commuters have been hammered on the one hand while, on the other, there have been cuts in the public transport investment budget.  The urban parking charge, to which my colleague referred, will impinge on many workers.  In many parts of the mid-Leinster region, Munster and Connacht, people must commute 40 to 60 miles because they have no choice.  There is no public transport.  For example, people must bring vehicles onto this campus if they are <Col N="334"/>Oireachtas civil servants.  They must also take their cars if they work in other public and private sector jobs based in inner city Dublin and in other cities.</P>
        <P>The extraordinary betrayal by the Green Party of the transport budget is astonishing.  More than 63% of the infrastructure budget, amounting to some &euro;2.1 billion, has been allocated to the roads programme.  While we have always supported road improvements and maintenance, in respect of which there are cuts, the Green Party is supporting a transport agenda that prioritises roads.  During the years I spent in the first civic alliance with the Green Party, particularly in local government, a <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the party seemed to be to increase public transport.  Some 15 months in government and the Green Party is out of touch and abandoning one of its basic creeds.  As incredible as this seems and notwithstanding Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn&rsquo;s comments, it appears the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, is more concerned with public and sustainable transport than his Green Party colleagues because of his defence of several Transport 21 projects.</P>
        <P>The Minister listed a number of projects, including the Luas extensions, enhanced bus corridors, phase one of the western rail corridor to Athenry, the Midleton rail line, phase one of the Navan rail line and so on, but these are well under way and have been known of for some time.  A number of major projects are in grave danger, for example, the interconnector that CIE and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann want to build, which would transform the city via a four-line DART network.  People wonder what will be the project&rsquo;s pace in 2009, given the level of cutbacks.  Why will the interconnector and metro north not be moved ahead together?</P>
        <P>From the briefings I have been given by officials at the Department of Transport, the real story in transport is that metro west, the Lucan Luas line F and the red and green line BX Luas link-up, which we have heard about <i>ad nauseam</i> from Ministers, are in grave danger or have disappeared from the agenda.  In terms of other important projects, such as the Navan rail line, in which the Minister is probably interested, and the western rail corridor, we must ask whether either of these vital national projects will get past stage one.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have corresponded and interacted considerably with Labour Party councillors in cities such as Cork, Galway and Limerick regarding light rail lines in all three.  What is occurring on this front?  We do not know whether the relevant feasibility studies will be completed.  The projects seem to have been placed on the back burner indefinitely.</P>
        <P>Fears concerning the total abandonment of metro west and the Lucan Luas line epitomise what the Green Party has done.  I welcome the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s commitment on metro north last week.  Despite Deputy Kennedy&rsquo;s comments, I have been a strong supporter of metro north because of economic and other developments.  Unfortunately, the route will not pass through my constituency as I had advocated, but I am happy to see it pass through Dublin North and Dublin North-West.  I hope the work to be done in 2009 will not peter out and that there will be no further harsh news in the years ahead.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before the 2007 general election, my colleague, Deputy Shortall, called for a massive increase in the Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus fleets.  We are still waiting.  Since Transport 21&rsquo;s establishment, Dublin Bus has only received 100 additional new buses.  If one wanted an accessible, reliable and speedy bus service for all city quadrants, one would need 300 to 500 new buses.  I was struck by how the Minister, when discussing this issue last week, did not seem to understand how a bus company worked or how many buses needed to run at peak times to provide an efficient and reliable service.  Why is the Green Party staying in government, why is there a green component in the Government and why can we not have a general election?</P>
        <P>During the budget debate, I welcomed the new cycle to work scheme, which provides for a maximum tax exemption of &euro;1,000 in a five-year period.  Why could the Ministers for Transport <Col N="335"/>and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government not embark on a wider pro-cycling initiative?  The latter merely discussed a Sutton-Sandycove cycle route, which has been in the works for ten or 15 years.  Local councillors in the various councils around Dublin Bay handled the issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Gormley, also spoke last week about producing an electric car sector to follow the examples set by Denmark, Israel and so on.  I would welcome this warmly, but the only way the Minister&rsquo;s carbon budget will reduce transport emissions &mdash; transport and agriculture are the two problem areas in terms of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions &mdash; will be by plunging the country into a significant recession.  There is a close relationship between rates of economic growth and percentage rates of increase or decrease in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  The Minister and his seven parliamentary colleagues have decided to get us in the right carbon emissions territory by bringing about a major recession.  As my colleague, Deputy Tuffy, stated, nothing in the carbon budget details how anything can be done quickly about carbon emissions.</P>
        <P>The parking levy will be problematic.  Will part-time workers on the minimum wage be levied at the same rate as highly paid senior executives, as seems to be the case?  If an employee does not have a dedicated car parking space but shares it with other colleagues, he or she would still face a &euro;200 whammy.  Last week, I was contacted by a couple sharing a car.  Must they pay &euro;400?  As with so much else done by the Government, we are finding out the intricate and desperate conditions day by day.</P>
        <P>The air travel tax will have an unhealthy impact on, for example, Shannon, the west and the tourism industry, an area that did not need any more taxes or hassle, given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>One of the meanest cuts was in the road safety budget.  Last weekend, seven citizens died in car accidents.  We have been calling for a speed camera system.  Some 11 years ago, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, stated that Ireland would get a speed camera system.  It would have cost &pound;25 million then.  We are still waiting because it is not referred to in the budget.</P>
        <P>The budget is outrageous and unacceptable in that it targets the most vulnerable, low and middle income families.  They are carrying the can for the disastrous mistakes of the Taoiseach and Charlie McCreevy.  The budget shows that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party are out of touch.  While it would be difficult for every Deputy, there should be a general election.</P>

	<P>We find ourselves in difficult and uncertain times, unprecedented in my lifetime.  Turmoil in the financial markets and steep increases in commodity prices have placed enormous pressures on economies throughout the world.  The budget sets out a plan to deal with these unfavourable circumstances.  The aim is to restore order and stability in the public finances and to increase productivity and competitiveness.</P>
        <P>The budget seeks to secure the significant gains we have made in the past 15 years.  These include the increase in the numbers at work to 2 million, major improvements in living standards, a more generous welfare system and the largest public investment programme in the history of the State.  All these advances were made in better economic times.  However, the <Col N="336"/>context has changed dramatically and with great rapidity.  It is incredible to consider how quickly our circumstances have changed in the recent past.</P>
        <P>As a small open economy, we are vulnerable to economic shocks beyond our shores.  There has been a sharp rise in unemployment and a steep decline in revenue, with businesses experiencing the types of economic difficulties not seen for more than two decades, although we are now in a better position to address those difficulties.  We must not forget that even in this global downturn, Ireland continues to attract a disproportionate amount of all foreign direct investment into the European Union.  We continue to welcome announcements of new investments in cutting edge companies and new high value jobs for graduates.</P>
        <P>The Government is determined to retain and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a pro-enterprise economy and an attractive location for foreign direct investment.  The most important action we can take in this regard is to stabilise our public finances.  Fiscal responsibility has ensured a modest national debt burden, a strengthened ability to deal with the financial and economic crisis now affecting the world economy and a credible tax regime which incentivises work and investment.  We must take the right decisions now to place us on a path to budgetary stability in the interests of everybody who lives and works in the State.</P>
        <P>The budget provides a social welfare package of &euro;515 million, with spending in this area increasing by 8.4% to &euro;19.6 billion.  Education will see an increase of 2.8% to &euro;8.7 billion, while health spending will rise by 2.1% to &euro;15.8 billion.  The budget acknowledges the importance of protecting young home owners.  Mortgage interest relief increases to 25% for first-time buyers in the first and second years of their mortgage.  Most auctioneers have welcomed this initiative and expressed confidence that it will be of benefit to those seeking to purchase their first home.  First-time buyers in the third, fourth and fifth years of their mortgages will see an increase in mortgage interest relief to 22.5%.  Those in years six and seven will continue to receive relief at 20%, while those after year seven will continue to receive relief at 15%.  The existing local mortgage scheme will increase the maximum loan available to borrowers from local authorities.  In addition, a single Government equity initiative will be introduced to assist those seeking affordable housing and to simplify the delivery of affordable homes.</P>
        <P>The budget provides for &euro;56 million worth of improvements in support of families and children.  The qualified child rate is to increase by &euro;2 to &euro;26 per week.  All family income supplement, FIS, thresholds are to increase by &euro;10 per week per child.  The income threshold for the back to school clothing and footwear scheme will also increase to allow more families to qualify.</P>
        <P>The budget recognises the importance of keeping people in work.  Capital expenditure of &euro;309 million, representing an increase of &euro;15.4 million over the 2008 forecast outturn, is made available to continue the implementation of the strategy for science, technology and innovation, SSTI, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to promoting a competitive, knowledge-based economy.  This provision will continue to support the work of Enterprise Ireland in driving innovation and research and development in companies, and will maintain the commitment to world class research through the capital allocation of &euro;179 million to Science Foundation Ireland.</P>
        <P>Support for the major enterprise development agencies will continue in 2009, with a &euro;90 million capital expenditure allocation to IDA Ireland to attract foreign direct investment.  A further &euro;48.4 million will be allocated to Enterprise Ireland for the indigenous sector, reflecting the importance of maintaining and attracting foreign mobile investment and a strong commitment to increasing exports by indigenous companies.  By moving to restore stability, the economy will be in a position to benefit from the next global upturn.</P><Col N="337"/>
        <P>We all must pull together in these uncertain times.  However, we must not forget how far we have come as a country.  The past ten years have seen a major increase in the public services financed by taxation.  Day-to-day expenditure has risen by 200% between 1998 and 2008.  Spending on health has risen by 293%.  Provision for education has increased by 174%, while the social welfare allocation has risen by 200%.  Many other European Union member states are also obliged to take difficult decisions.  This is a financial shock that affects everyone.</P>
        <P>I am concerned by the recent announcement of the intended closure of four Army barracks.  This came as a complete surprise to me, particularly the proposed closure of Connolly barracks in Longford town.  I hope this proposal does not proceed and I will meet the Minister to make the case in this regard.  A rally will take place in Longford town next Saturday at 2 p.m. after which a march will proceed from the railway bridge to the barracks.  I will attend this rally to show my support for and solidarity with the people of Longford.</P>
        <P>I wish to make absolutely clear my opposition to this proposal.  I am not closing the barracks.</P>

	<P>In fairness to Deputy Barrett&rsquo;s party, when Mr. Louis Belton was Deputy for Longford he kept the barracks open by political intervention.  I recognise that achievement.  We kept it open for the succeeding 23 years.</P>
        <P>I intend to arrange a meeting between the Minister and the town and county mayors. They will be coming to Dublin to protest outside Leinster House on Wednesday week.  I have been in contact with the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, and hope to meet them tomorrow.  I will continue to impress upon the Minister and the Chief of Staff the importance of keeping this barracks open.  The Chief of Staff will meet the soldiers at Longford barracks this Thursday and I hope he will bring clarity to the matter.</P>
        <P>This is a tough budget &mdash; we are in hard times.  The Government takes no pleasure in telling people it does not have sufficient finances.  It has a duty to govern and to make decisions that are in the interests of the State and the people.  Short term, quick fixes are not the answer.  We owe it to our children and to future generations to straighten out our finances however long it takes and to ensure that we hand over the State finances to them in as good a state as they have been for the past ten years.</P>
        <P>I do not believe anybody could have in their wildest dreams envisaged the wealth we enjoyed for the past ten years.  We are all completely shocked by the recent deterioration in finances worldwide in such a short space of time.  I wish the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, well.  It is a tough time.  They have a duty to this country and have, and will continue to, govern well.  This is an important time in our history and tough decisions had to be made.  Sadly, not all were popular decisions but they will in the long term prove to be in the best interests of Ireland and its people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ChrisAndrews"><NameTxt>Deputy Chris Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this budget.  I believe it is the first of a number of difficult budgets because clearly matters will not improve over night.  The situation in the globalised world in which we live today, as in Ireland, is pretty severe.  Despite the difficult economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, Ireland today is in a much better place than it was ten or 15 years ago.  Currently, we have 2 million people in work.  This is not to lessen the impact of people losing their jobs, which is clearly a traumatic experience, or the fact that more people will leave Ireland to find work abroad.  However, the need to leave Ireland does not carry with it nowadays the same fear experienced in the 1980s <Col N="338"/>that if one left, one might not get back for many years.  The changing world and airline industry makes it possible for one to feel not very far away from home.  While people may have to move to another country for work, they will not leave with the same level of sadness with which people left in the past.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been a real improvement in living standards in Ireland and we now have a much more generous welfare system.  The Government introduced the biggest public investment programme in the history of the State.  All these advances were made in the context of good public finances and impressive and record levels of economic growth.  However, we are in exceptional times and must make difficult choices.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has made difficult choices.  I believe he has a steady nerve and a steady hand and showed his coolness under pressure two weeks ago.  The situation with the banks showed the Minister to be a man apart from the crowd.  He was impressive and is continuing in that vein.</P>
        <P>The global economy is going through a severe storm.  I recently heard President Bush say on radio that things are getting better.  I am not sure I share his optimism, but who knows?  Perhaps he will get one thing right during his tenure as President.  In this severe economic storm, Ireland is but a small boat bobbing on the economic seas and has been left open to the harsh winds of the downturn.  We must make the right decisions now.  While they may not gain us short-term popularity, people will in time recognise they were the right choices.  Time will prove that this budget was what was needed to steady the Irish ship in these stormy times.  It will be the first of many budgets devised to get us back on course and to take advantage of the upturn in the global economy when it inevitably comes.</P>
        <P>Two weeks ago, the Minister for Finance introduced measures to deal with the threat to the banking system and the knock-on effects on the economy.  There has been much talk of the Government bailing out the banks.  The Government did not assist the banks for the banks&rsquo; sake.  It did so to ensure that the economy did not collapse around us and that families and communities throughout the country were not plunged into the economic abyss that faced us.  Many people, excluding the Labour Party who did not support the Minister, believe he handled the matter with great confidence and determination.</P>
        <P>The banking system in Ireland differs from the banking system in the US and other models used throughout Europe.  Each banking system has grown up with its own differences.  There has been much criticism of the regulatory system in Ireland which is made up of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance.  Despite what people say, the banks, who are players in this, do not want the banking system to go under.  They have as much interest in the banking sector surviving this crisis and in co-operating with the Minister for Finance through the new bank guarantee scheme.  Our regulatory framework is among the best in Europe, if not the world.</P>
        <P>Last April, I was part of a group that visited New York and Washington to meet with different groups from the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and some of the banks.  It was clear that there was no one in the US who had a vested interest in calling a halt to what was happening.  From homeowners and brokers who thought they would make a killing right up to Wall Street, everybody felt this could not go wrong.  Clearly, nobody was there who wanted to or was able to call a halt.</P>
        <P>That is not the case in Ireland.  We have difficulties but in America, national confidence in the banking system collapsed.  This spread like a virus through the Irish banking system and we now have a real problem.  It was not caused by any gross negligence in the banking system but by the lack of confidence in the American banking system.  I understand sub-prime lending <Col N="339"/>in Ireland accounts for less than 3% of the residential market whereas in the US it accounts for over 25%.  Clearly, our market and banking system bear little resemblance to that of America.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt this year&rsquo;s budget has been one of the trickiest in many years as we are not in as healthy a financial position as we enjoyed over the past ten years.  We are not alone in this position as countries across the world are experiencing downturns and face tough decisions.  When one considers what has happened in Iceland, one can be thankful we have a Minister for Finance and a Taoiseach who could act with such decisiveness and determination.  Although their actions were criticised by Germany and England &mdash; the British Government expressed concern &mdash; those governments realised the Irish model was to be followed.</P>
        <P>The overall aim of the budget is to rebalance the public finances.  This will not be done in one or two budgets and may not even be done in three.  We must do it and savings sought by the Government must be found.  They will be sought through indirect taxes, such as the rise in cigarette and fuel taxation &mdash; there was some discussion as to whether the tax on cigarettes should have been increased by more for health reasons.  In considering health issues, one must take the broad view that, on balance, the increase achieved by Government is fair.  The same applies to the rise in the cost of petrol.</P>
        <P>The &euro;200 levy on non-principal residences is innovative.  I represent Dublin South-East and a large section of the constituency has second homes or non-principal residences.  All these people have said that although they would prefer not to pay it, the levy is there and they are not that upset about it.  They recognise that paying a small levy is not a significant inconvenience.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied this budget is pro-business and aims to encourage new commerce and research, which is vital to keeping the economy healthy in the long run.  Measures include an increase in the research and development tax credit from 20% to 25% and the remission in capital gains tax for new companies in their first three years.  The filing of tax returns is always a big concern for businesses and the Government proposes to encourage take-up of the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s on-line service by providing a general extension to existing deadlines where returns and payments are made via the on-line system.  This is a good initiative which is about encouraging people rather than penalising where possible.</P>
        <P>It is very important that corporation tax is kept low and achieving this aim has been prioritised.  Even US presidential hopeful John McCain is now talking about this in his speeches.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of the recent controversy about medical cards but it is important to focus on the fair deal initiative, for which the budget has provided &euro;55 million.  The deal will make arrangements for financial support for people who need long-term care, which is vital to ensuring stability and security for people in old age.  In the past few days we have seen that security and being able to plan for the future is a very important requirement for older people in the community.</P>
        <P>I welcome the increase in mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers.  The decline in house prices has offered some opportunity for those seeking to get on the property ladder but it is nevertheless daunting for those trying to purchase a home.  I spoke to a group of young people in employment today who said it was a good budget for them because prices are coming down and mortgage interest relief is going up.  It has been increased from 20% to 25% in the first two years of a mortgage and to 22.5% in the third to fifth years.  The rate has reduced from 20% to 15% for non-first-time buyers.  It is a good initiative.</P>
        <P>Although we speak of the rising unemployment rate, we must remember that over 90% of the workforce is still in employment.  Such people see house prices coming down and are closer to the opportunity to buy a home, which is good.  Every cloud has a silver lining and such people see it.</P><Col N="340"/>
        <P>There has also been a significant increase in investment in social and affordable housing, which I fully support.  This is being done largely through the extension of the local authority mortgage scheme and the introduction of the Government equity scheme.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt people will have to make sacrifices.  I welcome the 10% cut in Ministers&rsquo; salaries, although I am not sure Ministers would welcome it.  It sends a signal.  None of us wants to pay tax &mdash; if we had a choice we would not pay any &mdash; unless one is from an ideological party which believes so much tax should be paid that nothing would ever work.  To refer back to America, I heard US presidential hopeful Barack Obama say he would prefer to pay no tax.  Although nobody wants to pay tax, we recognise we must do so to get the balance right.  The Government has done this and its approach has been to make tough decisions now so we can ride out the economic downturn and be in a good position to avail of the upturn when it arrives.  There is no doubt we are in a better position to do this than we were ten, 15 or 20 years ago.</P>
        <P>I will briefly refer to the medical card.  Today&rsquo;s announcement and the accompanying figures will put older people&rsquo;s minds at ease.  A significant aspect for older people is having a bit of security and being able to plan for the future, as I mentioned.  The issues surrounding the medical card have shown that people were very upset by these events and I am genuinely sad at the upset and concern which older people felt on the withdrawal of the card.  Many people were unclear as to whether their medical card was to be withdrawn, although in many cases it would not.</P>
        <P>Those who would have been affected by the original proposal were clearly upset and everybody knows people of advanced years.  I welcome today&rsquo;s announcement.  The Minister has shown he is willing to listen and to bring about changes when the case is strong.  Older people had a strong case, which they made, and the Government will get on with managing the country.  In many ways, the Government has acted as a union for older people and Members must ensure they continue to protect older people.</P>

	<P>While sitting in the Chamber for the past hour or so awaiting my turn to speak, I have been listening to speaker after speaker on the other side of the House stating that sacrifices must be made and the books must be balanced.  While that is all great stuff, at whose expense?  This budget is a complete cop-out.  I had the pleasure of serving in the Cabinet a couple of times and anyone who knows anything about running a country is aware that the three main spending Departments are Education and Science, Heath and Children and Social and Family Affairs.  The bulk of public expenditure takes place in them.</P>

	<P>How much of it is spent?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has copped out from taking the hard decision to cap salaries or have a pay freeze and to deal with reform of the public service.  Instead, almost 85% of the total budgets of the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science go <Col N="341"/>on salaries.  Consequently, those who wish to make cuts without touching salaries will be obliged to fiddle around with 15% of the budget.  This is the reason for all the stupid decisions that have become apparent since the budget last Tuesday.  I wonder whether anyone foolproofed this budget before the Minister delivered it, as anyone who did so would have discerned the wrongdoing that was being perpetrated on two essential groups in society, namely, the elderly and our schoolchildren.</P>
        <P>I am in my 60s and can remember my parents and many neighbours who were much older than me.  They lived on scrapings in Ireland and fought to educate me and others when there was no free education.  They paid high rates of tax, in excess of 70% or 80%, at times when things were bad.  These are the people who were singled out in this budget to balance the books and to get the economy back on track.  What a load of nonsense.  The Minister for Health and Children has a budget of &euro;15.8 billion and I will refer to the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s budget speech and the facts he presented therein.  He stated: &ldquo;Since the establishment of the HSE the number of whole-time equivalent staff has increased by 12%.&rdquo;  The number of administrative staff alone has increased by approximately 1,900 since the executive&rsquo;s establishment.  The Minister went on to state that the Government has decided that a targeted voluntary early retirement scheme will be introduced for the HSE and discussions are under way on the development of such a scheme.  This will initially be targeted at surplus middle management and administrative staff, he added.</P>
        <P>This is a Minister for Finance who admits the HSE, which has a budget of &euro;15.8 billion, has surplus staff about which he has done nothing for a number of years.  He has allowed the number of administrative staff to increase by 1,900.  However, the single cut he sought in this area was to take medical cards from people who are over 70.  What an extraordinary thing to do.  Moreover, the Minister stated, with hand on heart, that we all must make sacrifices.  This constitutes complete and utter mismanagement and cowardice of the worst order.</P>
        <P>When this debate resumes tomorrow, I will deal with the subject of education in greater detail.  However, I will refer to others who have been affected.  I received an e-mail from a lady who spends her life looking after children with autism, particularly those who leave primary school and attend secondary school.  Heretofore, at 16, such children were in receipt of a disability allowance of &euro;197.  It went to the family towards dealing with this terribly difficult problem.  However, in this budget, the Minister has decided to take the allowance from 16 year olds and one now must be 18 before getting it.  Although there are 1,900 surplus staff in the HSE, the elderly and the disabled have been hit.  I refer to a disability allowance for a 16 year old whose parents must put up with tremendous hardship.  They must travel for miles to get any sort of education for a child who is not capable of earning a living alone.  This is the sort of cutback one gets when one funks the hard decisions and does not do one&rsquo;s job.  In the past ten years, the Government has failed to do its job.  I do not want to hear hypocritical comments that, having listened for the past week, the Government suddenly realised the hardship it was causing for old people by taking away their medical cards.  What a load of nonsense.</P>
        <P>One now hears that everyone, save the super rich, will retain them.  To be super rich is to be someone on &euro;700 a week, which is &euro;36,400 per year.  This is the exact figure to which the Minister for Finance, in his budget, has increased the standard 20% rate of tax.  In other words, those who now are on the standard rate of tax are being called the super rich.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>How will this system work?  What constitutes a couple?  In the case of a married couple in which the wife has no income, will she be regarded as having an income of &euro;36,400 in order that she and her husband can earn up to &euro;1,400 per week?  Alternatively, <Col N="342"/>is it someone who has independent means?  What happens if one of them dies?  Does the other partner lose his or her medical card?  Should they take into account any small savings they may have?  None of these questions has been answered.   The level of uncertainty increases with each passing day because the Government refuses to recognise that it made a great mistake in asking vulnerable people over 70 years of age to give up their medical cards.  As I have noted, the income limit is the same figure at which one pays the standard rate of income tax.  The Government should not try to claim it now only intends to take the cards from the super rich and that 95% of those who are over 70 will have a medical card.  How can the Government possibly state that a person who is on the standard rate of income tax is part of the super rich?  Such nonsense is hard to stomach.</P>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt> <P>Regarding the other interesting point that arose in the Minister&rsquo;s speech, Members should watch this space.  The next thing to be attacked will be child benefit.  Will there be another debacle on child benefit and will incomes be taken into account?  The Minister stated he intends to halve child benefit payments for children aged 18 and, eventually, the benefit will be taken away from them.  This marks the beginning of another system of taking away a benefit that was awarded previously, through the taxation system, without an income limit.  It is the beginning of something which will cause untold problems in the future.  Will the Minister explain how people on the standard rate of tax at &euro;700 per week are suddenly the super rich?</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann demands the immediate reversal of the Government decision to withdraw the automatic entitlement to a medical card from citizens aged over 70 years.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">I wish to share time with Deputies Shatter, McCormack, Naughten, Breen, Feighan, O&rsquo;Mahony, Sheehan, Bannon, Sheahan, Deenihan and Coveney.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion is as simple as it is clear.  It demands neither more nor less than a reversal of the decision to withdraw the over 70s entitlement to a medical card.  The Government has lost touch with the people and misled its own backbenchers.  It thought it could carry out this attack on the elderly under the guise of patriotism, when it was more like an act of terrorism.</P>
        <P>The principle is simple; universal health care for everyone over the age of 70.  For seven years those pensioners had universal health care.  Those are the people who made this country what it is today, notwithstanding the Government&rsquo;s best efforts to undermine them.  They raised us, nursed us when we were sick, protected us from violence, grew our food and ran a proud Civil Service.  Are we to repay them by taking away something which was freely given by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Martin, and his Government in 2001?  What is that Minister&rsquo;s view of the matter?  I have not heard a single word from him since news of the Government&rsquo;s decision broke.</P><Col N="343"/>
        <P>This decision is morally wrong and the people of the country know it.  That is why the Church of St. Andrew on Westland Row was full to bursting this morning with anxious, worried and, now, angry pensioners and their families.  That is why thousands will descend on this House tomorrow.  The decision is penny wise but pound foolish.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, told us that the annual cost of a medical card is &euro;1,650.  With the loss of their medical cards, many of those affected will attend their doctors less frequently than they should and may not take their medicines regularly.  If they end up in hospital as a result, one day&rsquo;s care will negate any saving made to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>Professor Des O&rsquo;Neill has mentioned the health gains made by the elderly since the introduction of the scheme in 2001.  He does not insist that the health benefits are directly related but points out that the gains in the area of strokes and heart attacks have been substantial between 2004 and 2006.  This begs the question of whether anyone in the Department of Health and Children has conducted a cost-benefit analysis on money saved by removing universal entitlement versus the cost to the Exchequer arising from ill health, attendance at hospitals and medications.  Invariably, medications supplied in hospitals turn out much more expensive than those prescribed in general practice.</P>
        <P>For the sake of &euro;20 million, we are sacrificing the principle of universality in health care for the over 70s.  What is next?</P>

        <P Just="Left">This saving could have been made in many ways.  More than &euro;100 million could have been saved in the health service by introducing generic prescribing.  A further &euro;105 million could have been saved had an additional 50 cent been put on the price of a pack of cigarettes.  At least &euro;100 million could have been taken from banks through the bank levy.  Many people believe the banks got off extremely lightly.</P>

	<P>Deputy Kennedy stood up and applauded the budget last week. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is Fine Gael policy to introduce universal health care and we have established a policy commission to examine how best to achieve that aim.  It makes no sense to remove the medical card from the over 70s.  It is important to point out that the removal of the card is in direct contradiction to the stated aim of the Minister and Professor Drumm of supporting people at home and in the community, thereby avoiding hospitalisation.  How does Professor Drumm feel about this matter?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach was asked today whether he would give an undertaking that he would not interfere with the other universal schemes for the elderly but he waffled and refused to answer.  He wonders why some of us who thought this was an inappropriate measure at the time of its introduction have changed our minds.  It is because we now understand that, after seven years, people have become dependent on medical cards and have a legitimate expectation of them because of the health gains I outlined earlier.  We are also aware of the savings made to hospital budgets and the need to support people at home.  Furthermore, it is no time to kick the elderly when international turmoil on the markets has reduced pensions to flitters.</P>
        <P>Due to the Government&rsquo;s incompetence, it has repeatedly failed to introduce the promised fair deal legislation for long-term nursing care.  The &euro;110 million earmarked for this measure last year has been capped at &euro;55 million for next year, which is a clear indication that many people who would otherwise avail of it will be unable to do so.  To add insult to injury, the Government plans to reduce the tax relief on nursing home expenses from the top rate to the standard rate from 1 January 2010, thereby increasing the cost to families of nursing home care by a minimum of &euro;200 per week.  Having asked us why we might have changed our minds, the Taoiseach, the Minister and Government backbenchers fail to answer why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;they believed it was a good deal and was the right thing to do in 2001, when they went around the country describing what great fellows they were for rewarding those who paid tax at 60% in the tough times.  Why is it now such a bad idea?  Where has the morality gone? My personal belief is that once Irish citizens have adequate food, clothes on their backs and roofs over their heads, they should be entitled to proper access to health and education regardless of their status, creed, race or religion.</P>
        <P>The Minister intends to remove the saver clause, which states that in the interest of equity and fairness the medical card can be reissued for a three-year period on a once-off basis.  Will that be removed for the over 70s or for everybody?  Where was the early warning system in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party?  Was it asleep at the wheel or has it lost its social conscience?</P>
        <P>What about the Green Party, with two senior Ministers, Deputies Gormley and Ryan, who were fully briefed on the issue, and one Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, all of whom voted for the budget presented by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan?  Has that party also lost its social conscience?

	<P>The Deputies will be embarrassed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>They understood and believed that when Fianna F&aacute;il decided to provide universal health care to the over 70s it was based on some principle.  What they did not realise is that the only principle to which Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats espoused in 2001 was how to get elected as rapidly as possible and how to fool as many people as possible.  There was no principled commitment to universal health care, they were simply using and manipulating the elderly for political gain.</P>
        <P>Just as easily, last week, they decided to throw the elderly aside.  I do not believe that is an appropriate way to treat people.  If one extends the right to universal health care in circumstances in which they rely on it for their lives, one cannot simply withdraw it arbitrarily.  The chaos the Government has created has resulted in three versions of the scheme being announced over the past week.  As Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies gathered in panic, realising the impact of what they had done and moaned on the national airwaves, the Government sought to re-examine the decision.</P>
        <P>The decision of today is just as flawed as those earlier decisions.  To suggest that an individual with &euro;36,500 gross is among the super rich is such a warped view of income as to defy understanding.  The proposals announced today are flawed and will give rise to a need for further clarification and will create further difficulties.  For example, what is the position for a couple in their 70s with an income of &euro;1,200 per week when one of them dies?  The widow or widower may be left with a small additional leftover occupational pension from the deceased spouse as well as his or her own pension.  Will such a person, with perhaps &euro;800 gross per week, find that the State deprives him or her of the medical card as a consequence of the death of the spouse?</P>
        <P>What about the other benefits that accrue to those with the medical card?  Deputy Reilly referred to the Government policy of allowing elderly people to remain in their homes and experience independent living.  That requires the support of visits from community nurses.  Will we deprive individuals of that right when we take the medical card away?</P>
        <P>What is the situation of those who have been given cards with no expiration date?  Are they supposed to hand back their cards?  Is there to be a new police service operating out of the Department of Health and Children or the HSE, visiting the elderly and demanding the return of cards given to them for the entirety of their lives, as perviously issued based on the Government&rsquo;s policy?  It is extraordinary that the Government has sought to deal with the elderly in this way.</P><Col N="346"/>
        <P>Deputy McDaid told us that this is an issue the Government pursued to renegotiate the deal done with the doctors.  The Government could have attempted to consult the doctors any time over the past seven years without frightening the elderly and using them as weapons in an industrial relations bargaining process.  It is a disgraceful and disgusting way to treat people.</P>
        <P>Tomorrow evening there will be an opportunity for Members opposite, who have been vocal in their protests about this policy and who sought to reassure their constituents, to vote in favour of the Fine Gael motion.  Will they have the courage to vote the way they are talking?  Will we see members of Fianna F&aacute;il huddled together like horrified hobbits holding hands going up the stairwell and turning to the left to vote against this Fine Gael motion, or will they have the courage to vote with their feet?</P>
        <P>Will we see the Green Party and hear more hot air from it, contributing to the increase in climate change?</P>

They were like the Gunner McGee, leading the regiment from behind.

        <P>We had the spectacle of two Ministers, Deputies Brian Lenihan and Willie O&rsquo;Dea, on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; trying to lay the blame on the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.

        <P Just="Left">If the Government had any concern for the elderly, it would have abandoned this budget.  I was at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church with 500 or 600 people.  Despite what was reported on the &ldquo;News At One&rdquo;, that Age Action Ireland had welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s climbdown, not one of the speakers in an hour and a half welcomed it.  Every speaker castigated the Government.  They said that they will wait and, unlike on previous occasions, they will remember this when going into the voting booth at a general election, which cannot be too far away by the way the Government has performed in the past few days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of the means test is a Trojan horse, one that can be used to water down the entitlements of the elderly over the coming months.  Based on the <Col N="347"/>Government announcements, the proposed income thresholds are dependent on Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan getting a deal from the GPs.  At present, over 70s on the standard rate of tax have been branded as the super rich.  The reality is that far more than the 14% of those with a medical card will lose this entitlement, contrary to the announcement today.  What is stopping the Government from cutting income limits again once the D&aacute;il removes the automatic right to a medical card for over 70s?  If this right is removed, what is to stop the Government removing free travel, free electricity and free telephone entitlements?  What will be the income threshold for a couple where one person is under the age of 70 and one is over that age?  Will the promised thresholds be based on income tax returns for 2007, or on incomes for 2008 that have seen significant reductions on dividends and interest rates?  Will the Government try to make up the savings by reducing the benefits of having a medical card?  We have already seen that those on medical cards have had their entitlements to chiropody and optician services reduced.  Will access to medicines be taken from the medical card, with the result that even those who have the card must actually pay for their prescriptions?  </P>
        <P>There is no doubt that this budget targets elderly people for a financial hit that should have Government Deputies hiding in shame.  Instead, as we saw in this Chamber last week, they gave a standing ovation to the announcements of the Minister for Finance and to his cutbacks in respect of the elderly, including the removal of entitlement to the medical card.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be significant cutbacks next year in funding for repairs to houses for the elderly and disabled.  Any elderly person who must raise a loan as a result of not being able to get funding under those grants will get no recognition by way of means assessment in order to make repayments to banks or building societies.  The calculations are now based on their gross rather than on their net income.  On this occasion, therefore, those people will be doubly penalised because the Government is taking away the housing grants.</P>
        <P>For &euro;20 million, one third of the cost of electronic voting machines, this issue could be resolved once and for all.  The Government could have changed the regulations to enable pharmacies to dispense generic drugs instead of branded ones, saving &euro;150 million, &euro;50 million above the savings it proposes in this measure.  If only the Government had charged the banks slightly more than &euro;500 million it would not have had to proceed with this callous proposal.  This Government&rsquo;s policy has been to save the banks and screw the pensioners.</P>

	<P>I welcomed the automatic entitlement of people aged over 70 for the medical card.  At the time I felt that it acknowledged the people who worked so hard, lived frugally and gave enormous sacrifice to bring our country to where it was.  Unfortunately, Fianna F&aacute;il did not see it that way but rather saw it as a pitch for the grey vote in advance of the 2002 general election.  It carried out no prior calculations to determine the costs and the number of people involved and seriously underestimated this situation.</P>
        <P>If I may put forward a word to describe this action by the Government last week, it is &ldquo;lousy&rdquo;.   One man who wrote to me said it was the lousiest thing any Government had ever done to the old and vulnerable in this society.  He said the Government gave the banks the kid glove attitude but when it came to the old and vulnerable they put the boot in.  Shame on this Government and the way it has treated the elderly people of our country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Reilly and Fine Gael on bringing this motion before the House.  I have only a couple of minutes but I want to convey to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and to the Government the real depth of feeling that all of us have encountered in our offices and clinics and on our telephones over recent days.  The Government&rsquo;s action has caused unnecessary fear and hurt and confusion, because of the changes that were made or announced daily.  Some calculations, like that of today, are based on gross income.  Last week&rsquo;s were based on net income and that change caused further confusion.  People felt fear, because they felt they would lose their independence and that their families would have to pay for them in their old age.  They were hurt, because these are the people who never complained all their lives but worked hard, only to have this taken away from them when they might have enjoyed some little comforts in their old age.</P>
        <P>These are the people who grew up in difficult economic times of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, when they got little or no assistance from the State to raise their families.  The breadwinner usually had to emigrate and send money home to feed the children.  These are the people who paid the high taxes of 60% in the 1970s and 1980s when Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments told us all we had to tighten our belts.  The only comfort they got was when they reached 70 years of age and got their medical card, seeing it as thanks for the sacrifices they made during the hard times.  These are the people for whom the world darkened last Tuesday as a result of this savage budget.  The changes announced almost daily since then have just added to the confusion, fear and hurt.  Medical cards allowed people to be cared for at home and in their communities.  The card, with all its ancillary services and benefits, plays an essential part in supporting older people to live independently within their communities for as long as possible.  Independence is very important for old people.  It was taken away last Tuesday and I ask everybody to support this motion to restore that independence to the old people of this country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I rise to defend all those people who are retired and who built our nation into what it is today.  At times they paid an effective tax rate of up to 60% during their working careers, or caring for our children.</P>
        <P>As somebody who has worked all my life in politics to help the weaker members of the community, this is the meanest decision I have ever seen.  We will very soon see if those opposite who gave the budget speech a standing ovation &mdash; though I do not know where those soldiers of destiny have gone tonight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;have the guts to admit they got it wrong, and to vote to reverse this decision which tried to take the full medical card from nine out of ten elderly people entitled to this scheme.</P>
        <P>My real concern is that many of these people whose sense of security has been taken from them will be unable to go to their doctor or afford the prescribed drugs and will end up in hospital at a greater cost to the taxpayer.  Was this decision taken during the summer?  Was the budget brought forward by two months in order to allow the overburdened bureaucrats in the <Col N="349"/>Health Service Executive time to process the means test?  The Government should instead have been consulting the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
        <P>Now that we have a self-assessed medical card, would the Government not like another two months in order to re-draft the budget in respect of the medical card, the Lenihan levies, the savage cuts in teaching posts, the welfare payments to the disabled, the charging of nurses for parking while on night shift?  Will the Government charge the Bray firemen for their parking last Friday night?</P>
        <P>The historical facts of this matter offer a classic example of Fianna F&aacute;il stroke politics.  In the year 2000, during a campaign from this side of the House, it was pointed out that only 29% of the population were being awarded medical cards while the general medical scheme agreement with the Irish Medical Association allowed up to 40% of the population to be covered by this scheme.  Under pressure to do the right thing and raise the income limits, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, chose to do all the wrong things.  He proposed at the stroke of a pen that the medical card should be extended, without reference to income, to everyone aged over 70 on 1 May 2001 in order to entice the grey vote to vote for Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Deputy Martin&rsquo;s mismanagement does not end there, however.  He underestimated by more than half the number of people aged over 70.  He had no comprehension of the medical card scheme and so had to renegotiate a whole new scheme at short notice while fighting the South Tipperary by-election, in which he had no room to wriggle.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning&rsquo;s announcement by the Taoiseach on the issue of medical cards for those aged more than 70 years is undoubtedly a climbdown by a shamed Government which sought to save &euro;100 million at the expense of those aged  70 years and upwards, including those aged more than 100.  It does not matter how vulnerable one is or whether one is elderly, infirm or disabled, the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government would, if it could get away with it, take from them over and over again to make good its mistakes.  The voice of the people <Col N="350"/>roared in disgust and, in a move designed more to save the Government than to benefit pensioners, the Taoiseach backed away from certain political suicide.  The problem, however, is that the Government did not climb down far enough.  In a face-saving measure the Taoiseach amended the plan outlined by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, rather than scrapping it outright.  In taking over the reins the Taoiseach relegated his Minister to the status of a boy.</P>
        <P>As for the Minister for Health and Children, the less said the better.  Speaking on radio earlier today, Deputy Finian McGrath indicated that the Minister&rsquo;s inflexible stance on universal payments, of which she is not a fan, is the stumbling block to the complete removal of this appalling and disgraceful measure.</P>
        <P>To have proposed to take &euro;100 million from those aged over 70 years was criminal when one considers the sum would have barely covered the amount the Government squandered on dud e-voting machines for which it continues to pay and which it should have scrapped long ago.</P>

	<P>As always, however, things are not as straightforward as they appear.  In typical two-faced Government speak, Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies have been overheard telling constituents to cover their tracks &mdash; that is putting it mildly &mdash; when declaring their income levels once the assessment is introduced on 1 January.  It seems the answer to the question, &ldquo;When is a lie not a lie?&rdquo; is when it is a Government lie.</P>
        <P>Shame on the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government for first using and abusing the elderly people of this country before attempting to get them on side.  Shame on the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children for causing such anguish over the saving of a mere &euro;100 million which, as we all know, the Government could squander at the stroke of a pen at any time, as it has done several times over the past ten years.  Never again will the Government enjoy the trust of the electorate.  The people have spoken and the made a vow of wrath against this democratically elected Government, which will never recover from the damage it has done.</P>

	<P>As Robert Emmett said, &ldquo;Let no man write my epitaph for no man knows my motives.&rdquo;  These words are pertinent in the case of the Minister for Health and Children.  When I was elected to the House, many members of the public sympathised with and pitied the Minister on the job she was trying to do.  I am afraid the position has changed and we have turned full circle.  Some of the words I have heard used to describe the measure on medical cards include &ldquo;lousy&rdquo;, &ldquo;cold&rdquo;, &ldquo;hard&rdquo;, &ldquo;unwarranted&rdquo;, &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Minister is brow beaten and should be ashamed of what she tried to do to those aged over 70 years.  Her biggest slip was to introduce a measure which affects entire families.  As she will discover when the ballot boxes are next opened, no one wants his or her grandmother, grandfather, mother and father to be picked on.  She cannot blame this cock up on the Health Service Executive, which has served as a good scapegoat on which to blame all her mistakes.  The Minister&rsquo;s political epitaph consists of two lines.  Now that her party and colleagues have disappeared, it is time for her to follow them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As a result of this collective Government decision, the concept of universal health care is dead.  Those aged over 70 years considered the medical card to be a sacred cow which provided them with reassurance, comfort and security.  It was one of the most effective instruments of primary care ever introduced.  A medical card for a person aged more than 70 years cost &euro;1,650 per annum to the State.  The availability of the card meant a large <Col N="351"/>number of people did not have to go to hospital where a stay of one night costs as much as the annual cost of the medical card.  For this reason, the budget measures on medical cards do not make sense.</P>
        <P>In County Kerry 13,500 people aged more than 70 years have medical cards.  If even 5% &mdash; the figure cited today &mdash; of this group are deprived of their medical cards, 670 elderly people will be affected.  This is bound to put pressure on services in Kerry General Hospital and elsewhere.  Even at this stage, I appeal to the Minister and sensible members of the Government, of whom I am sure there are still a few, to withdraw the measure, even on financial and economic grounds.</P>
        <P>Tomorrow, thousands of people will gather on the street outside the House.  In my 21 years as a Deputy I have never seen old people being forced to come to the House to publicly demand and fight for their rights.  Surely this sends a message to the Government.  I doubt the Minister is completely deaf and hope she is listening and watching.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has made a mistake on the issue of medical cards.  Last week, people had been conditioned to expect tough measures and were prepared to accept a difficult budget if it targeted problem areas which need to be reformed to return the country to a path of recovery.  Elderly people who are not part of the problem were targeted last week.  Despite the political stunt we saw this morning as the Government sought to defuse political tension, those aged over 70 years remain nervous, unhappy and distressed.  Under the new so-called means test, an automatic entitlement to a medical card will apply to those with an annual gross income of less than &euro;36,500, which is below the average industrial wage.  Those excluded will not be wealthy former bank managers, senior civil servants or politicians but pensioners who previously enjoyed middle incomes.  They expected protection from the State and had planned their future on that basis.  The measure should be reversed and the House should support the motion.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will put two or three questions to the Minister.  Is the budget the result of the collective wisdom of all Government Ministers?  If so, the uncertainty about the content of the budget pertaining to medical cards displayed by all Ministers immediately after its delivery in the House is adequate evidence of the Government&rsquo;s careless and callous approach to the elderly.</P>
        <P>Did the Government consider targets other than the elderly?  Why did it not tax the many tax exiles who, from afar, appear to have more influence on Government policy than Ministers?  The Minister must emphatically state that she will withdraw this measure which is a disaster for the Government and elderly people.  Why did they not tax the many tax exiles we have, who seem to have more power from afar in the delivery of Government policy than the Ministers?  It is important that the Minister for Health and Children should emphatically state tonight that she is withdrawing this disaster for this Government and for the country&rsquo;s elderly.</P>

The Department of Health and Children, in the context of this year&rsquo;s budget, had to reduce its expenditure by &euro;700 million on what had been planned.  There is no low-hanging fruit in health.  It is not easy to find sums of money of that order &mdash; that is a fact.  I can say with confidence, and give many quotations, that the GMS scheme, as constructed, is rising at such a rate that no matter who was in this job, he or she would have to tackle it.

	<P>To be fair to my ministerial colleague, Deputy Martin, he negotiated that in good faith.  The Government made the decision in the context of financial circumstances very different from those we face today.  In the context of the budget it was a priority for the Government to introduce the fair deal to help older people in long-term care.  We know we have a highly inequitable situation where someone in publicly funded residential care or in a contract bed gets 90% of the costs paid.  However, somebody in a private nursing who has not got a contract bed has to pay 60% of the cost.  That is unfair.  It is placing an enormous burden on older people and their families and that is why the new legislation is important.  Provision is made to introduce that next year. </P>

	<P>The proposal that the Government announced this morning will save &euro;100 million in 2009.  As the House knows, we have established a process and are not allowed to negotiate with the IMO under Irish competition law.  A process is to be established, to be chaired by Mr. Eddie Sullivan.  He will receive submissions from the Irish Medical Organisation this week, from individual practitioners and others who have an interest in this area.  Next Tuesday he will report to me and we will discuss this matter at Cabinet on Wednesday.  The intention is to have a single fee for all patients over 70.  I do not believe it is right that those over 70 who got a medical card based on means &mdash; 215,000 people &mdash; were worth approximately &euro;160 a year to their doctor while those who qualified automatically, based on age, were worth &euro;640.  I do not believe that is fair. </P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>That it is not sustainable, particularly in the context of doctors seeking to work in areas of disadvantage &mdash; and neither is it fair to the patients.  The hope is that we will have a single capitation fee for all patients over 70, the same fee regardless whether they had a means-tested card before they reached that age.  I believe that is appropriate. </P>
        <P>Dr. Michael Barry, the leading expert in Ireland, who heads the pharmaco-economic school in Trinity College Dublin and is attached to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, as well as being a member of the board of HIQA, is going to oversee a process regarding prescribing practices and so on.  A combination of the capitation, the prescribing practices and the 20,000 who will not qualify for medical cards, will deliver savings of &euro;100 million during 2009.   The incomes about which we are talking here are incomes earned by people who leave employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I would say to Deputy Perry that we must bring legislation to the House to do what he suggests.  It is a fair that to each doctor a patient who reaches the age of 70 should be worth the same.  Everybody would subscribe to that.  It is particularly important for doctors working in disadvantaged areas.</P>

	<P>I would say to Deputy Bannon that we all have older family members and we know how older people are feeling.  The vast majority of older people were not affected by the decision made by the Government.  Some 65% of people over 75 years have their medical cards based on means.  They were never affected by this decision.</P>
        <P>The income thresholds, which the Government announced today, are &euro;700 for a single person and &euro;1,400 for a married couple.  Deputy Gilmore asked earlier how we can verify that data.  We have given that data to the Labour Party.  Higher pension incomes are earned by only 5% of our population.</P>

	<P>Unfortunately, the average income of people over 70 years is approximately &euro;260 per week, believe it or not.  Only 57,000 people over the age of 65 years ever reach a taxable income.  We are confident that no more than 20,000 people, or 5% of those persons aged over 70 years, will not be entitled to a medical card as a result of this decision.  </P>

	<P>In regard to the challenges facing this country, the health service consumes approximately 30% of the money we spend running this country.  In recent years, health spending has been increasing by just under 9%.  It is the second highest growth in health spending in all the OECD group of countries.

There are limitations on what we can spend.  When there are limitations, we must make choices.  In particular, we must seek to target resources at those who need them most.

We listened to what the people, our councillors and our backbenchers said as well as to what anybody else who cared to share their opinions with us had to say.  We have made a decision and we have the humility to accept that a mistake was made and that the deliberative process fell short of what it should have been.

        <P Just="Left">I wish to touch on a few of the issues that have arisen in the past few days, in particular the issue of universality.  This matter came up in the Seanad today in a debate on child care provision.  Senator Bacik stated that primary care is a universal social service, which is a fair point.  We must consider what universality really means and whether it will apply to all social services and provisions within the economy or whether we can from time to time, in certain circumstances and in the straitened circumstances we have now, look at the question of universality in certain areas and pull back from that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a situation where medical cards are being given to people who, by their own admission, do not need them.  Large numbers of people over 70 years of age have not applied for them because they are genuinely patriotic people who know they do not have the need for that provision.  They know the spreading of resources around our economy is more appropriately served by issuing cards to those who need them rather than to those who can provide out of their own means.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy suggesting that those who apply for medical cards are not patriotic?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>People have bandied the word patriotism around this House, but what it means to people is that their patriotism can assist us in a practical way to get through this difficult period.  I do not say this in an effort to achieve some short-term political dividend or to get us out of the hole in which we find ourselves.  I say it because all of us must contribute to some extent.  I know that patriotism is not a clear concept to some people and that it is being used in a glib and trite way.</P>
        <P>The discussion we have had within Fianna F&aacute;il has been very useful.  I was a backbencher until recently and was not afraid to throw the rattle out of the pram once in a while.  It is a perfectly valid part of the armoury of a backbencher to do that from time to time.</P>

	<P>I wish to refer to a reference made as far back as 1977 that will give some context to our situation now in 2008.  We have had this debate before, have been in this position and will get out of it.  People must accept this.  In 1977, the NESC published research carried out by Eithne Fitzgerald, later a Member of this House, that concluded by stating:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The problem of coping with limited finance overshadows the provision of social services.  Despite the fact that social services have been absorbing an increasing share of Government spending and of GNP, the level of provision in relation to total need remains low in a number of areas.  Very many services, therefore, are selective in intent, in a bid to concentrate resources where they are felt to be most needed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is what we are trying to achieve in budget 2009.  There is an uncanny similarity between where we are now and that time.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Government still does not appear to understand what has happened among the general public.  It has lost the trust of the people.  We have just heard further lectures about getting through this and about patriotism, but it was the Minister for Finance who introduced the idea of patriotism in his budget speech.  The concept of universalism was a concept endorsed and put forward by many of the illustrious predecessors of the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.</P>
        <P>The Government no longer has the trust of the people.  Despite the fact it has rowed back considerably today, if any of the Government side had been in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church in Westland Row today and listened to the more than 2,000 people who were there, they would know the people are not at all satisfied with what has been announced.  They no longer trust the Government.  They know that despite the fact the limits have been upped, once universal entitlement has been removed any Minister can, with one stroke of a pen, reduce the limits and exclude more people.</P>
        <P>The people know too that the figures do not add up.  The Minister said the measure will only affect 5% of the elderly, but the figures on savings do not add up.  The most the Government could save, by my calculation, is approximately &euro;20 million.  I do not know where the Minister will get &euro;100 million from.  She will not get it, judging by the figures available to us.  We will have 330,000 over 70s entitled to full medical cards and 20,000 excluded.  That will not bring about the savings mentioned.  Therefore, people are concerned the Government will decide later that having talked to the doctors and not having got the agreement it wanted, it will say it is sorry but must now include more people.  There is no confidence that the scheme will work.</P>
        <P>The plan may work, save the backbenchers from revolting, keep the Fianna F&aacute;il Party together and may hold the Green Party in Government, but I was on a radio programme yesterday with Deputy Gogarty and he said the scheme would have to be scrapped or the Green Party would not be happy.  However, the scheme has not been scrapped and the concept of universalism is being removed.  The Government may have managed to hold the Green Party and the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers, despite what they said on the public airwaves, but it has not got the confidence and trust of the people.  The Government will see this tomorrow when the protest is held outside the D&aacute;il.  I am certain it will be a huge protest and that people will not accept the Government scheme.</P>
        <P>We have a Government that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.  This is demonstrated in what happened to the health services in the budget.  The Minister has said there is a 2.3% increase in the health budget, but that will not keep up with medical inflation, with already agreed pay rises or with our growing population.  There is no doubt that health services will be cut and hit hard.</P>
        <P>I wish to respond to the Minister with regard to what happened when universal entitlement was introduced by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mich&eacute;al Martin.  The objection of the Labour Party at the time was to the fact that doctors would be paid four times more for certain patients over 70s than for others and that this would provide an inequality of reward to doctors and would affect the way in which the population would be served.</P>

I do not understand why it is only now, seven years later, seeking a new deal with the doctors.  That could have been done at any time in the past seven years.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the period the over 70s have had free access to medical cards there is scientific evidence in studies that their health has improved.  In that context the Government knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.  During the period of universal entitlement, because the elderly were able to go to their GPs, have flu vaccines and have their blood pressure checked, the outcomes were that fewer people over 70 were described as disabled than in the period before free access.  There is real scientific evidence in a study published in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> that there was an improvement in the health of over 70s during that period.</P>
        <P>In taking away the entitlement the Government is taking a retrograde step.  In accordance with the policies the Minister has enunciated to have more people cared for in the community, to keep people out of hospitals and to have people attend primary care, in taking away the entitlement to a free medical card for the over 70s she is taking away the kinds of services that were keeping elderly people out of hospital.  The other aspect is that if they do not have a medical card, not only do they not have access to a GP and their medicines, they also do not have access to public health nurses, physiotherapists and the other supports that are vital in keeping elderly people in their homes.  Although the Minister says she wants to keep people in their own homes and in the community, one of the direct results of taking medical cards from the over 70s is that more of them will need to go into hospital and other more costly services which are not good for the community, not good for the elderly person and not good for the Government&rsquo;s budget.  We should learn from what has happened in those seven years.</P>
        <P>The other aspect of taking something from people who have had it is that it takes away the certainty they have come to rely on over the years.  When we first heard there would be a U-turn today we thought the Government might allow the over 70s who already have the medical card to retain it.  However, that is not the case.  There is a particular dishonesty in suggesting and implying, as I heard one Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher do on radio today, that a blind eye would be turned towards people who held on to the card even if their income was over the limit.  Whatever else about elderly people, they are honest.  People were horrified at the idea that they might try to hold on to the card if they did not qualify.  An element of uncertainty has been introduced which is a serious problem for elderly people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case I will conclude.  Fianna F&aacute;il once stated that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the disabled.  That is exactly what the Government has done to the old, sick and disabled in this budget.  From listening to people, I know they will not forget that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is frightening to think that a group of men and women sat around a Cabinet table in Government Buildings and approved the decision to re-impose means testing for medical cards for the over 70s.  Did they not consider the huge anxiety and anguish this would cause to hundreds of thousands of senior citizens?  Did they not consider the injustice of slashing this universal entitlement which they had introduced for the over 70s with such fanfare seven years ago and on which older people had come to rely?</P>
        <P>Even looking at it from the crude point of view of political management this has been a disaster.  What trust can the people have in these troubled economic times in a Government that could perpetrate such a massive political blunder?  More worrying is that fundamental policy decisions on health and taxation, affecting the lives of millions of people, could be taken in such a sloppy, irresponsible and ill-considered manner.</P>
        <P>The climb-down we have seen today came about because the first crack has now appeared in Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party discipline.  The departure of Deputy Joe Behan from Fianna F&aacute;il ensured that others were forced to speak out also.  I can only describe as pathetic the role of the Green Party Members who played their part to the full in the framing of this budget, including the medical card fiasco.</P>
        <P>The medical card climb-down by the Government today does not go far enough.  Universal medical card entitlement for the over 70s should be fully restored.  This decision comes from a Government clearly reeling after the wave of anger which hit it in the wake of the budget.  After creating all this anxiety it is now unclear whether the Government will make any savings from the scheme at all.  The original decision should still be reversed and universal provision for over 70s restored.  I commend senior citizens on making their voices heard so loudly and clearly over the past week.  They have rocked the political system and it is clear that massive public pressure led to this climb down.</P>
        <P>We in Sinn F&eacute;in approach this issue from a point of principle.  We say that access to health services should be based on medical need and medical need alone.  We want to see the State moving towards a universal public health system where all citizens would be entitled to health care services free at the point of delivery.  We want to see such a system funded from fair and progressive taxation because we believe that when people are working they pay their taxes in order that decent public services can be provided for them and for their families.  They pay taxes to ensure they are provided for in old age and that all children, and all those who are unable to work or are out of work, are properly looked after.</P>
        <P>We want to see a public health system which would employ general practitioners directly on set salaries.  Instead we have the current system where, under competition law, the Government cannot even negotiate directly with the IMO on GP fees for medical cards.  We have the ludicrous pretence that set GP fees do not exist.  We have the nonsense theory under competition law that people are going to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; between GPs to find the cheapest one.  We all know that is not the real world in which we live.</P><Col N="364"/>
        <P>We are constantly challenged when we call for better health services and wider entitlement.  The question posed is always &ldquo;Who will pay for this?&rdquo;  The question should be &ldquo;Who paid for this?&rdquo; and the answer is &ldquo;the pensioners of Ireland&rdquo;.  They paid for a decent health service in taxes during their working lives.</P>
        <P>If the Government is looking for savings then instead of taking away medical cards let it take away tax breaks from developers of private hospitals.  That tax break cost &euro;10.6 million in 2006, the last year for which figures are available, and that saving alone would have funded 6,000 extra full medical cards.  Making all discretionary tax relief schemes available only at the standard rate would raise &euro;1 billion.  Those are just two examples.  The Minister for Finance said his budget was a &ldquo;call to patriotic action&rdquo;.  The Minister and the Taoiseach should recall the patriotism of our senior citizens who worked all their lives and paid taxes at much higher rates than people paid during the Celtic tiger years and who made sacrifices in order that their children and grandchildren could enjoy a better Ireland.</P>
        <P>The other health cuts should not be forgotten and they will also hit older people hard.  Government backbenchers who have rightly protested about this medical card measure should be equally exercised about the entire range of other health cuts.  These include higher charges for medicines with the drugs payment scheme threshold increasing to &euro;100 per month; higher charges for hospital accident and emergency department visits; the miserly 2.1% increase in overall funding for health, which is way below inflation, resulting in major cuts right across the health services in 2009; and reductions in funding for disability services.  Even before the budget, there were cuts in home help hours, hospital services were closed for weeks to stay within so-called HSE budgets and queues were lengthening in accident and emergency departments.</P>
        <P>I support the motion and I urge all Deputies to support it and vote accordingly.  The Government decision, even in modified form, is an attack on the principle of universal entitlement.  The Government parties have their sights on child benefit and who knows what other entitlements will follow.  People power and political pressure forced a climbdown today on two issues.  That power and pressure should be maintained and people should unite in defence of decent public services for all and the third serious measure in the budget, the attack on our education system and the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Reilly and Fine Gael on tabling the motion.  As he said, it is clear and simple, unlike the Government&rsquo;s proposal to abolish the medical card for the over 70s.  I usually agree with much of what the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, says and I strongly agree with his comment that there was a great deal of confusion among the public.  The over 70s are the same as the rest of us.  They hear headlines about the removal of the medical card and that is chilling for people whose sole concern is security.  That covers everything from being safe in their homes, to food and heat security to accessing the health service when they fall ill and not having to worry about how much it will cost.  That is a fundamental issue, which worries everyone.</P>
        <P>I saw a film recently which was about total confusion.  Towards the end of it, a character asked what people had learned from it.  He replied that he hoped we had learned never to do it again.  This was followed by the punchline: &ldquo;If only we knew what we had done.&rdquo;  The Government parties still do not understand what they did.  They instilled fear in a group of people who felt in their latter years they would be secure and they would not have worries.  We hope to feel the same way when we retire.  However, in one swoop, the Government removed that security.  The issue was their sense of security, not the medical card.  A prominent member of <Col N="365"/>the Progressive Democrats once said if one could bottle security, one would be made for life.  The Minister for Health and Children should have learned from that person.</P>

	<P>If she had learned that, she should never have made this mistake.  It defies logic that 15 Ministers sat around a table, made this decision and no one said, &ldquo;Stop, this will not work.  You should not do it.&rdquo;  They also sat around the table and decided to increase the number of children in classrooms and no one said &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  They then decided to apply a levy to the wages of people earning less than the national minimum wage and no one said &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  My only explanation for this is that this is the first time the Government parties have had to make hard decisions.  It makes sense that if a Minister has spent 11 years being driven around, he or she will not know the price of petrol.</P>

	<P>I forgot that but their tyres will be paid for.  If one spends 11  years eating out, one will not know the cost of a restaurant meal.  If one spends 11 years out of contact with the average person, one will not realise what it is like to feel the sense of insecurity experienced by the over 70s last week.  Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan stated this group of people, who usually vote conservatively, has lost trust in the Government but they have lost more than that because they have lost their sense of security, which is paramount to them.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs to reverse this decision and forget the waffle about the 5% because it is not the worth the hassle.  People need this in black and white.  They should be told the measure will not happen and they will be allowed to keep their medical cards.  Let us move on to the cutbacks in education and disability services.  The budget should be thrown on a bonfire and the Government should start again.  It is a disaster and it will remain with the Government parties unless they decide to introduce a supplementary budget in order not to run with this one.  People in their latter years who for once felt secure about access to the health service with their medical cards no longer feel that sense of security.  The Minister should forget about the 5% and how much could be saved and allow them to retain their medical cards.</P>
        <P>She should strive to provide medical cards for every person aged under 16 but she will baulk at that.  The Government should have learned from the budget that it is a disaster on many fronts and it will not work.  The Government parties need to get rid of it and introduce an alternative.  The Government has probably run its course and we would all welcome a general election, particularly those in the Visitors Gallery, the over 70s, those involved in the disability sector and the teachers&rsquo; unions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this matter and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for taking it.  The shocking news that a major employer in County Kildare, Wyeth Medica in Newbridge, was seeking 250 redundancies by December 2009 and that another major industry, Tegral Building Products Limited in Athy, would follow suit was shocking.  They are the county&rsquo;s largest industrial <Col N="366"/>employers due to the significant haemorrhaging of employment elsewhere in the area for some time, including at Donnelly Mirrors, Black and Decker, Wallboard, IVI, Shuttlework Europe Limited, Pyma, Batchelors Limited, Monoject, Peerless Rug, Leinster Foundries, Polaroid and, in adjacent counties, Lappel, Irish Sugar and a reduction of staff at Braun Oral B.  Industry used to be at the forefront of employment in the area, but it has reduced.</P>
        <P>To add to the problems is the lack of drive on the part of IDA Ireland in providing alternatives.  I have resided in the area for more than 60 years and in that time only one replacement industry was acquired and that was in respect of Irish Board Mills where I was an employee.  That replacement has since gone by the wayside and the haemorrhaging has continued across the board.</P>
        <P>To add insult to injury, a number of IDA Ireland sites in Kildare South have been disgracefully neglected.  In five years, only two industries have visited the area.  I sought to determine whether IDA Ireland would sell the sites to the local authority to provide incubation units for indigenous industries in different towns.  Due to IDA Ireland&rsquo;s greed &mdash; it wanted to sell the sites to the local authority at today&rsquo;s prices instead of at the prices of the 1970s when they were first purchased &mdash; the deal fell through.</P>
        <P>When I pressed this issue in recent weeks, IDA Ireland admitted in local newspapers that it cannot attract industries to south County Kildare.  How could it do so when it does not bring industries to the county?  The newspaper headlines were incredible, as IDA Ireland conceded that it could not attract industry to the area despite how it used to be filled with industries.  The situation has worsened and IDA Ireland must return to the local authority to try to sell the three sites after being unable to conclude a deal in 2003.</P>
        <P>How can this occur?  Given the economic downturn, should we not consider how to promote indigenous industries?  This is an ideal opportunity for IDA Ireland to work with State agencies in starting up incubation units and ensuring the protection of jobs at Tegral Building Products Limited and Wyeth Medica.  Will the Minister of State examine the issue of the sites and tell IDA Ireland to forget about getting modern prices for lands bought cheaply in the 1970s and to work with the local authority in creating alternative employment in an agricultural area that has experienced significant employment losses through the closure of Irish Sugar?  Will he also ask the State agencies to work with Wyeth Medica and Tegral Building Products Limited to ensure that they are given every assistance in overcoming their considerable problems?  They should continue to be beacons of hope to the people of the area.  The work and dedication of their staff should be underpinned to ensure the companies&rsquo; continued success.  Will the Minister of State ask IDA Ireland to remodel what has been one of that body&rsquo;s worst performances to date?</P>

	<P>It is not a problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address some of the Deputy&rsquo;s points.  The recent increase in the numbers on the live register is unwelcome and traumatic for the communities involved.  It is an indication of the challenges facing the labour market and the economy as a whole.  The Government is taking specific measures to address the challenge and ensure that job losses are minimal and last for as short a time as possible.  Our priority is to create an environment that will allow those who have lost their jobs to quickly return to the labour market.</P><Col N="367"/>
        <P>The enterprise development agencies, with F&Aacute;S, the employment and training authority, are actively engaged in facilitating job opportunities in Kildare South.  Specifically, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s current strategy seeks to progress the development of a knowledge economy so that County Kildare can compete nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment to encourage increased co-operation between foreign direct investment companies and third level institutions in Kildare, such as NUI Maynooth, to work with the existing client base in the county and expand their presence &mdash; for example, in 2006 Curragh Carpets relocated to a new facility in Newbridge, maintaining employee levels &mdash; to provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure, including the recent site infrastructure developments with Braun Oral B in Newbridge, and to work with local authorities and relevant infrastructure providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to Kildare.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are 25 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Kildare employing approximately 10,356 people.  The reduction in job numbers in Wyeth Medica, while disappointing, was not unexpected.  This is a challenge facing us all, given how multinational companies are conducting global reviews.  We must ensure that we remain competitive and that we market Ireland as well as possible.  Unfortunately, companies&rsquo; sister sites are also competing with Ireland.  We will ensure that Ireland remains seen as a place to do business.</P>
        <P>Wyeth Medica announced the prospect of job cuts in March 2006, which are now being processed because of the significant reduction in the throughput and product volume of new products.  However, it is important to note that in October 2007 the company announced an investment of &euro;7.47 million in its research and development facility in Newbridge.  The new centre will be at the forefront of Wyeth Medica&rsquo;s development pipeline and will assist Newbridge in attracting a significant number of the new products coming out of the corporate research and development pipeline.</P>
        <P>In recent years, Kildare South has attracted world-class manufacturing companies, including Wyeth Medica and Braun Oral B, in addition to Intel and Hewlett Packard, which are also located in the county.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>At the wrong end of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>In the present competitive global markets, it is increasingly difficult to continue to attract such facilities as manufacturing companies in particular are going to low cost destinations such as China and central Europe.  Central American countries, including Brazil and Singapore among others have low corporation tax levels, good infrastructures and good legal systems.  Many companies are considering them is a sizable challenge and we must continue to address that.</P>
        <P>To address this market shift, IDA Ireland is refocusing to areas such as international services, software, financial services and pharmaceuticals.  In 2005, IFS established a facility in the Millennium Park in County Kildare.  The requirements of these types of project mean that they are increasingly attracted to larger populations, such as Kildare or Naas.  To support this strategy, IDA Ireland is also working closely with educational institutions in County Kildare, such as NUI Maynooth, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment.  The agency is also working with F&Aacute;S to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.</P>
        <P>The Millennium Park in Naas, within the environs of Kildare South, has three modern 40,000 sq. ft. advance office buildings that are now available for marketing to inward investors, with all the necessary infrastructure, including ducting for broadband.  New indigenous companies have been established and have created new employment in the county, which will benefit the <Col N="368"/>people of Kildare South.  It is expected that the consumer foods sector will continue to expand, reflecting significant changes in eating habits and an increase in demand for convenience foods.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue I raise is not of the same magnitude as the matters we have been discussing in recent days.  Nevertheless, it is very important to those affected by it, for whom it is causing great hardship and distress.  For almost eight months, the Health Service Executive has not been refunding moneys due to patients for certain drugs and items of medical equipment.  This represents a policy change that was undertaken in a completely arbitrary fashion and without any regard to the eligibility of patients.</P>
        <P>I am aware of two circumstances in which this change of policy is evident.  The first relates to patients in need of essential life-saving equipment in their homes, such as oxygen.  In the past, the cost of hiring such equipment was refunded each month in the normal manner under the drugs payment scheme.  That practice ended last March and these people are now carrying the cost of the equipment.  It seems the HSE simply decided one day no longer to reimburse the costs of these ill people.  The reason given was that the court challenge by pharmacists to the breach of contract decision might result in the HSE having to pay more.  The reality, however, is that HSE management hoped it would have to pay nothing.  This was a complete red herring.  The court case has nothing to do with the hiring of equipment and the latter has nothing to do with pharmacists.  The HSE was using sick people as leverage in its dispute with pharmacists.</P>
        <P>The second set of circumstances in which the HSE has failed to provide refunds is in the case of people who have experienced an out-of-hours medical emergency, whether at the weekend or late at night.  In such cases, people may have been obliged to obtain medicines from a pharmacy other than the one from which they usually obtain their prescriptions.  Even though they might have reached the monthly limit and were entitled to obtain those medicines free of charge, they were obliged to pay for them and have not been reimbursed.  The normal practice in such cases was that one paid up-front and was reimbursed later.  This is an absolute entitlement.  However, the HSE decided, again arbitrarily, not to pay out in order to discredit pharmacists with their patients and so help its court case.  Although it has lost that case, it still refuses to pay out.  The excuse now is that it will take time to work out how much it owes.  It certainly owes more than nothing, which is what those affected have received.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, relay my concerns to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, no later than tomorrow morning and ask her to insist that the HSE reimburse this money immediately?  However long it may take to work out exactly how much is owed, it should at least pay something on account.  People who require life-saving <Col N="369"/>equipment must have some of this money reimbursed because they cannot continue carrying the cost indefinitely.  The HSE is behaving despicably in this matter, using sick people as leverage in its argument with pharmacists.  It is simply not good enough.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure this practice ends tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Deputy for raising it as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the current position.</P>
        <P>In 1999, the drugs payment scheme, DPS, replaced the drugs cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS, and drugs refund scheme, DRS, whereby patients reclaimed drug expenditure from the former health boards.  Anyone who does not have a medical card is eligible for the DPS.  Under the scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;90 per month, rising to &euro;100 per month from 1 January 2009, for approved prescribed medicines, with the balance paid by the State.  This allows families and individuals to budget for the cost of medicines.  The DPS is for everyone.</P>
        <P>Dependants for the purposes of the monthly threshold include the spouse and any children under 18 years.  A dependant with a physical disability, mental handicap or illness who cannot maintain himself or herself fully, who is ordinarily resident in the family home and who does not hold a current medical card may be included in the family expenditure, regardless of age.  Dependants over 18 and under 23 years of age who are in full-time education are also included.  The upper age limit is in keeping with family law legislation.  People over the age of 18 years who are not in full-time education and those over the age of 23 years and in full-time education, and who are not eligible for a medical card, can avail of the drugs payment scheme in their own right.</P>
        <P>All those who are ordinarily resident in Ireland are eligible to apply for the DPS provided they do not hold a current medical card.  The scheme may also be used in conjunction with a long-term illness book.  Application forms for the DPS can be obtained from the local pharmacy or the local HSE health office.  The number of eligible persons under the DPS at the end of 2006 was 1,525,657, or 36.03% of the population.  The cost of medications under the DPS in 2006 was &euro;285.79 million.</P>
        <P>On occasion, payments to patients from local health offices under the DPS are made where a patient has not yet registered for the scheme or where the monthly threshold is exceeded through the use of more than one contracted pharmacy in a calendar month.  These payments would be reimbursement of costs already incurred.  In addition, when the scheme was established in 1999, certain exceptional items were included within its remit.  These include feeding sets, oxygen and oxygen equipment, laryngectomy equipment and elastic hosiery.  Oxygen equipment has been interpreted to include any breathing aid.  It is my understanding that some patients rent machines to assist breathing and the cost of the rent is reimbursed as appropriate through the DPS.</P>
        <P>Following the reduction in pharmaceutical reimbursement prices on 1 March 2008, claims made by patients to local health offices were made at the new lower reimbursement rate.  A number of claims in local offices have remained unpaid pending clarification of the recent High Court case regarding wholesale mark-ups because the pharmacies in question had charged the patient at the higher price rather than the lower reimbursement price.  Following the recent decision in this case, reimbursement prices, and consequently prices to patients, are being reinstated to the original level to comply with the court&rsquo;s judgment.  Consequently, the HSE primary, community and continuing care, PCCC, directorate is now examining the issue of refund payments to patients through local health offices.  As it involves direct payment to <Col N="370"/>patients, it is expected that this matter will be resolved shortly.  However, I will raise the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns directly with the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue once again.  Commitments were given to provide a new national school at Kilfinane in County Limerick in the lead-up to both the 2002 and 2007 general elections.  We were certain construction would commence following the election in 2007, but nothing has happened in the interim.</P>
        <P>On 15 February 2001, the management board received a commitment in writing that approval had been granted for the &ldquo;provision of a new school at the greenfield site&rdquo;.  The then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, subsequently confirmed this was the case.  On 4 January 2007, the management board was informed in writing that the school was &ldquo;one of 54 schools that has been recently approved to proceed to tender and construction over the next 12 to 15 months&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The current school was built in 1840 as a church and was converted to a school in 1887.  It was last refurbished after a fire in 1909.  It has a current enrolment of 137 pupils, encompassing an annual increase in each of the last three years as a result of the increased population in the area.  The toilets are located outside the main building, leading to problems with child safety and protection, potential bullying and discomfort and stress for staff who cannot supervise due to the extremely high windows which provide no visibility for students availing of toilet facilities.</P>
        <P>In March 2005, the school had to be evacuated due to an infestation of rats.  The school secretary operates from a stand-alone cubicle in the entrance hall, the resource teacher works in the store room and the learning support teacher provides remedial teaching in a cubicle in a shared classroom.  Public access to the school is via a narrow back lane with serious road safety issues.</P>
        <P>The building itself is very old.  As I stated, it was built in the 1880s.  It consists of six classrooms, a hall and a cloakroom.  The classrooms are small &mdash; three of them are only 25 metres in area &mdash; and are divided by thin panels of timber and glass which are not soundproof.  The windows are high and many cannot be opened for ventilation.  The hall which is used for PE and dancing classes has been reduced in size to accommodate a much needed secretary&rsquo;s office.  There is one more room in the building which is used as a library, a classroom for the learning support teacher, an office and a staff room.  Anyone conscious of safety will be aware of the real danger this school presents if, God forbid, a fire occurs.</P>
        <P>One of my main concerns is the location of the toilets.  The children are forced to leave the security of the school building and cross a yard in all types of weather to go to the toilet.  This practice is not acceptable in this day and age, neither is it ideal for children suffering from diabetes or asthma.  Some children are genuinely nervous about going out to the toilet alone during class.  Concern has been highlighted about the presence in the area last year of an undesirable individual known to have taken photographs of young girls.  His actions have also demonstrated a good knowledge of the geography of the more secluded areas of the school, which is worrying.  The parents need a more secure environment for their children.</P>
        <P>Kilfinane national school is located in a residential area on a steep incline.  The narrow road becomes dangerously congested at school delivery and collection times.  It is impossible for a bus to undertake a school run owing to a lack of space.  The parish of Kilfinane is rapidly expanding with the latest estate of houses due for completion in November 2008.  As yet, no provision has been made to cater for the extra children who intend enrolling during the next <Col N="371"/>few years.  The school is a co-educational school with a current enrolment of 137 children.  There are five teachers, a learning support teacher and a resource teacher who are dedicated to the education of their children.  They are patient, kind and always have the best interests of the children at heart.  Their task of teaching is a daily struggle for them and their pupils.  They must contend with limited resources and an unacceptable noise level.</P>

        <P>In January 1998, the board of management applied to the Department of Education and Science to carry out structural work on the school.  The Department undertook a feasibility study and took into consideration that the school is located in a restricted site and is subject to a preservation order.  The Department decided a new school on a greenfield site was required and approval for same was granted in 2001-02.  A promise was made that the new school in Kilfinane would commence construction immediately following the general election.  In November 2002, the Sisters of St. Paul donated a site for the school.  The Department carried out a feasibility study and the site was deemed suitable.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter because it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position with regard to the proposed building project for Kilfinane national school, County Limerick.  Kilfinane national school has a current enrolment of 126 pupils.  It has a staffing of a principal, four mainstream assistants, one permanent resource teacher and one permanent learning support teacher, the latter shared with another school.  Originally, the board of management applied to the Department of Education and Science for capital funding for an extension project.  A feasibility study was commissioned to examine the merits of upgrading and extending the existing building as opposed to the provision of a new school on a greenfield site.  The Department took a decision in favour of the greenfield option on the basis of the outcome of this study and for reasons of cost effectiveness.</P>
        <P>A site was identified, inspected and found to be generally suitable for the construction of a new school.  This has been purchased by the diocese.  It is intended to provide long-term accommodation in the new building for a principal, five mainstream assistants and the full range of ancillary accommodation appropriate to a school of this size.  The project was included among those announced by the Minister for Education and Science on 29 November 2006 to proceed to tender and construction stage.  Tenders have been received and the project is awaiting approval to proceed to construction.</P>

	<P>When?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated previously in this House that he shares fully the concerns of the whole school community in Kilfinane about their school building, particularly in the matter of the outdoor toilets.  The Deputy will be aware that he visited the school in the <Col N="372"/>recent past and spoke directly to the pupils, teachers and parents, assuring them that this situation would be remedied as soon as resources are available.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy will appreciate that while the Minister is committed to advancing the project for Kilfinane as soon as funding is available, the reality is that not all the demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget can be met at the same time.  This being the case, all application for capital funding in the Department must be prioritised and advanced in accordance with the priority attaching to them.  To achieve this, the Department of Education and Science consulted the education partners following which it introduced prioritisation criteria for the allocation of funding to large-scale building projects.</P>
        <P>Not alone has the introduction of these published criteria improved the management of the building programme but they also ensure an orderly advancement over time of all school building projects, with the most urgent need being addressed first in accordance with the level of funding available.  The Minister does not wish to see any school operating from less than satisfactory accommodation.  However, he must be realistic in terms of the overall demand on the Department&rsquo;s budget not only to meet the needs of rapidly developing areas where there is little or no school accommodation in existence but to address the decades of under-investment in the existing school stock prior to 1978.  This is not an easy task and it will take time.  An enormous volume of work has been carried out by the Department in recent years with more than 7,800 projects having being carried out during the lifetime of the previous national development plan.</P>
        <P>The Department has been positioned with an allocation of &euro;581 million in the current budget to continue with its programme of work to provide pupil places where they are needed and to continue its modernisation programme for schools such as Kilfinane. The Minister told the pupils, teachers and parents in Kilfinane national school that their building project is a priority.  He wants to again assure them that he is sincerely committed to advancing their project as soon as the requisite funding is available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter.  St. Mark&rsquo;s junior and senior national schools have more than 1,000 pupils in their care in an area not designated disadvantaged.  The area concerned is a modest private housing estate of approximately 2,000 houses, a very high proportion of which are privately rented.  A large number of these privately rented houses are leased to immigrant families whose children comprise 48% of the junior school.  The junior school, for example, has 258 children for whom English is not their first language.  Recently the junior school got sanction for six language support teachers, four of whom will not be re-employed under the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s budget announcement.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Some 258 newcomer children in a school with an enrolment of 536 has placed a huge responsibility on the school, a challenge which the teachers have taken up with very considerable success and evolved best practice with little help in the matter of guidelines from the Department.  It seems to be unpopular with some outside commentators to highlight that if a school is inadequately resourced to cope with the language difficulties of newcomer pupils this will have a seriously adverse impact on indigenous pupils.  Only a year and a half ago St. Mark&rsquo;s junior school won six language support teachers, or one teacher per 43 pupils with a variety of language needs.  The Minister proposes to cap such resource teachers at two.</P><Col N="373"/>
        <P>To compound the damage the same school now stands to lose &euro;25,333.93 in grants, money that was used to provide books for necessitous pupils, psychological assessments and so on.  This small grant was of immense value.  How in the name of heavens does the Minister of State consider that a school like this can cope with this huge proportion of non-national children and at the same time tend to the needs of its indigenous pupils?  Before the very recent arrival of the language support teachers and notwithstanding the diligent efforts of the established teachers, numeracy and literacy levels over ten years suffered badly.  Despite the scale and novelty of the challenge nobody from the Minister&rsquo;s Department visited the school in over ten years to experience the challenge.</P>
        <P>Now as the two schools on the St. Mark&rsquo;s campus are about to get on top of the challenge, the Government proposes to undermine them.  Notwithstanding that the St. Mark&rsquo;s schools are not in an area designated disadvantaged, the proportion accessing third level is improving but is still not large enough.  There are many young people who do not get to third level and some who do not finish second level.  For the Government to attack primary school children as it has done in the budget is indefensible and I ask the Minister to withdraw the reimposition of the ceiling for language support teachers.</P>
        <P>I conclude by referring to the statement issued by the teachers.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">We are beside ourselves with rage and genuine upset at the body blow that has been dealt to the primary sector by this budget.  Everything we have worked for in these schools &mdash; and we know we speak for hundreds of principals &mdash; is now at risk.  We did not get adequate resourcing in the good times and now we will be even further disadvantaged.  Does anyone seriously imagine that we can manage with fewer than six language teachers?  Even with six, each teacher has an allocation of more than 40 pupils, with a variety of language needs, coming from 37 countries and with a variety of cultural diversity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it affords me the opportunity to outline the position with regard to language support teachers and the position at the school in question.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the increase of &euro;302 million in the education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken.  These decisions included reducing the level of language support teachers from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.</P>
        <P>At a general level, the ongoing requirement for current levels of language support teachers in schools should also start to reduce in line with lower levels of immigration and in line with improvements in the levels of proficiency of those pupils for whom this resource has been available.  Nonetheless, schools that require language support will still be entitled to get it.  The budget measures will mean that the level of that support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.</P>
        <P>However, the budget measures also provide for some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment.  This will be done on a case by case basis.  The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically.  Schools will be applying afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009 and 2010 school year, based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any new <Col N="374"/>pupils they are enrolling.  The position of the school in question will fall to be considered at that stage along with all other schools making application to the Department.</P>
        <P>A number of measures had to be taken in the education sector to help contain public sector pay while providing for demographic and other changes.  At primary level, these included an increase in the enrolment bands of the staffing schedule for the allocation of teachers in primary schools from an average of one teacher for 27 pupils to an average of one teacher for 28 pupils.  As the processing of the September 2008 enrolment returns for primary schools are not yet finalised by the Department of Education and Science, it is not possible to outline to the House this evening the impact these changes will have on the allocation of mainstream teaching posts for the 2009 and 2010 school year for the school in question.  The staffing schedule for the 2009 and 2010 school year will issue to all schools as soon as possible and at that time a more accurate indication of the mainstream staffing levels will be available.</P>
        <P>The Department is aware of the funding pressures on schools.  However, progress has been made in recent years that has seen the primary school capitation grant increased from &euro;81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of &euro;200.  This represents an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.  The primary capitation grant has been improved by more than &euro;21 to bring the rate to &euro;200 per pupil.  The ancillary services grant for primary schools will also be improved by &euro;3.50 to &euro;155 per pupil.</P>
        <P>Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full ancillary services grant will get &euro;355 per pupil, or almost &euro;25 extra, in this school year to cover their day to day running costs, with a primary school of 300 pupils getting &euro;7,475 more.  In 2000, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than &euro;40,000 to meet its day to day running costs.  That same school under these new rates will receive &euro;106,500.  This excludes the salary of teachers and special needs assistants which are paid by the Department.</P>
        <P>Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from &euro;512 to &euro;986 per pupil, an increase of 59% from the rate in 2006.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, appreciates that the abolition of a number of grants for some schools will impact on funding levels in 2009 but it is also the case that enhanced levels of funding announced in the budget for the capitation and ancillary services grants will help to alleviate the impact of this.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has been provided with a script detailing the facts pertinent to the school in question.  I thank the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the current position.</P>

The overall goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) introduced in February 2007 is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. These commitments and the social inclusion commitments in the National Development Plan have wide-ranging support, having been drawn up in consultation with the social partners and other stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The latest results from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), released in November 2007, indicate the Government being on target to achieve this goal. It showed that the rate of consistent poverty in the population in 2006 was 6.5 per cent, down from 7 per cent in 2005 and 8.2 per cent in 2003. The next round of EU-SILC results which will show the position in 2007 will be available shortly.</P>
        <P>The NAPinclusion contains 12 high level strategic goals in key priority areas and over 150 more detailed targets and actions designed to meet the goals set down. The Plan has a particular <Col N="376"/>focus on the effective delivery and implementation of quality public services for each stage of the lifecycle. Detailed action targets cover the broad spectrum of services including education, health and long-term care, housing, income support, employment supports, early childhood development and care, transport, and sport and culture.</P>
        <P>The NAPinclusion provides for a comprehensive and efficient monitoring and reporting process, the key element of which is the preparation by the Office for Social Inclusion, based in my Department, of an annual Social Inclusion Report. The first Social Inclusion Report, published last November, showed that progress has been made and that social inclusion targets were on track for the period under review.</P>
        <P>This Government remains committed to delivering on its commitments in the NAPinclusion, as resources permit. Even in these difficult economic times, the Government has prioritised delivering real increases in social welfare payments. The Budget provides for increases of between 3 per cent and 3.8 per cent in the basic rates next year, ahead of the projected rate of inflation of 2.5% for 2009.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 126 and 182 together.      </P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, a review of the Combat Poverty Agency was undertaken on foot of a Government Decision on the 6th of June 2007.  The purpose of the review was to examine the role of the Agency in light of the emergence since 1986 of comprehensive strategies and new institutional arrangements to promote social inclusion (such as the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, the Office for Social Inclusion and the voluntary pillar in Social Partnership).</P>
        <P>The Government, having considered the review report, has decided to integrate the Combat Poverty Agency with the Office for Social Inclusion. It is not my intention that Combat Poverty will simply be absorbed into the Office for Social Inclusion in its existing form.  Rather a new strengthened division will be created which will make the best use of the considerable experience and expertise of the staff of both existing bodies and will seek to address the weaknesses identified by the Review in relation to both. I believe that this new division will provide a stronger voice for those affected by poverty and social inclusion issues.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the concerns about the need for independent scrutiny of public policy that have been expressed by some interest groups. I absolutely agree that independent critique is very important and this move is no way intended to reduce the scope for such work.</P>
        <P>As the review report notes, the function of independent reporting on poverty is no longer as dependent on Combat Poverty as it was in earlier years. This is due for example to the emergence of other independent data sources such as the statistics on poverty reported by the <Col N="377"/>CSO, and independent analysis by bodies such as the ESRI and NESC and on the international front by the EU and OECD.  Of course, Ireland is well-served by the social partners and a wide range of NGOs and other groups who have a strong voice in public debate about poverty and related issues.</P>
        <P>Procedures will be put in place to ensure that the views of these and other stakeholders, including people experiencing poverty, continue to be available to Government in developing and monitoring the social inclusion strategies.</P>
        <P>Combining two organisations will naturally result in savings to the Exchequer, for example, in the areas of accommodation and support services. The extent and timing of savings will be identified and dealt with as part of the implementation of the Government decision which is underway.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 135 and 176 together.</P>
        <P>The statutory basis for the introduction of a personal advocacy service under the Citizens Information Board (CIB) was provided for in the Citizens Information Act, 2007. However, having regard to the current budgetary circumstances, it will not be possible to proceed with this next year.</P>
        <P>The provision of an advocacy service remains a priority for this Government. In this regard, significant resources have been provided since 2005, and will continue to be made available under the auspices of the Citizens Information Board for the development and provision of advocacy services for people with disabilities. Funding of &euro;1.8 million was provided in 2008 for service developments which include advocacy services. This brings the total funding for advocacy services to &euro;6.1m for the period 2005 to 2008.</P>
        <P>The Community and Voluntary Sector Advocacy programme has been developed by the Board since 2005 and has funded 46 separate advocacy projects. The overall focus of the programme is on representative advocacy for people with a disability. Projects either operate within a specific geographic area or are focused on a particular disability type. Each of the projects poses different challenges, some requiring more intensive work with smaller caseloads while others have larger caseloads with shorter periods of client contact.</P><Col N="378"/>
        <P>Up to the end of June 2008, 3,241 members of the public have availed of the services provided by the projects. The breakdown per year is as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2005 &mdash; Nil</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2006 &mdash; 744</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2007 &mdash; 1,322</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />June 2008 (6 months) &mdash; 1,175</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There was an increase of 78% in the number of people availing of these services between 2006 and 2007 and the figures for the first six months of this year suggest that a similar increase will occur in 2008.</P>
        <P>The Citizens Information Board is monitoring the programme to ensure that the projects are operating in accordance with the Board&rsquo;s advocacy guidelines. It is planned to undertake a full evaluation of the Community and Voluntary Sector Advocacy programme in 2010.</P>
        <P>The Citizens Information Board also provides advocacy through the Citizens Information Services focusing on access to services, welfare entitlements and employment rights. This type of mainstream advocacy is also open to people with disabilities and the Community and Voluntary Sector Advocacy programme is creating close links with the Citizens Information Services to ensure that people with disabilities are encouraged and supported to use the mainstream services where possible. The advocacy capacity is being strengthened through the provision of Advocacy Resource Officers who work to build the capacity of information providers within the Citizens Information Services to advocate on behalf of clients. There are nine Advocacy Resource Officer in operation across the Citizens Information Services network.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied with the developments undertaken to provide advocacy services for people with disabilities through the Citizens Information Board since 2004. The Department will continue to work with them to further enhance advocacy services for all citizens including those with disabilities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 131 together. </P>
        <P>The Department undertakes advertising and awareness activities to ensure that all members of the public are made aware of their rights and entitlements and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur. The amount spent on advertising and awareness activities in any one year is determined by the number of specific activities as well as the media used. In addition, the Department also undertakes routine adver<Col N="379"/>tising such as notices in relation to Christmas and Easter arrangements and recruitment. The Department uses a mix of advertising media including national and provincial newspapers, radio and television, information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots.</P>
        <P>The total amount spent on advertising and awareness activities in 2007 was &euro;1.4m.  Having regard to the current budgetary circumstances, the expenditure on advertising and public awareness activities will be reduced in 2008 and 2009. The total allocation in 2008 for awareness campaigns and routine advertising was &euro;1.6m. However, it is estimated that expenditure to the end of 2008 will be approximately &euro;1.2m giving savings of &euro;400,000.  The total allocation for advertising in 2009 is &euro;800,000 giving additional reduction in expenditure of &euro;400,000.</P>
        <P>This action is being taken in a situation where information on the full range of social welfare schemes and services is available from the Department&rsquo;s local offices and the nationwide network of Citizens Information Centres. In addition, many people access information on the Department&rsquo;s and Citizen Information Board&rsquo;s websites. Essential advertising campaigns will continue to be undertaken as required.</P>
        <P>The total amount spent to date in 2008 on advertising and awareness campaigns is &euro;1.1m. In February and March 2008 separate advertisements were placed in the national newspapers inviting public submissions on the development of the Department&rsquo;s Customer Action Plan and Customer Charter, and on the development of a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy at a total cost of &euro;199,000.</P>
        <P>In February and April 2008 advertisements, costing almost &euro;260,000, were placed in national newspapers in relation to the Green Paper on Pensions inviting participation at public seminars and giving notification of the closing date for receipt of submissions.</P>
        <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the budget enquiry line were advertised in 2008 at a cost of &euro;192,000 and &euro;34,000, respectively. General advertising costs amounted to &euro;418,000 to date in 2008.</P>
        <P>In 2007, the amount spent on such activities was almost &euro;1.4m. The main advertising campaigns in 2007 related to the introduction of all-Ireland free travel scheme, which has enabled citizens aged 66 or over to travel for free within Northern Ireland with effect from April 2007, which cost &euro;400,000; the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which cost &euro;200,000; and the new half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, which has enabled considerable numbers of people to claim half of the carer&rsquo;s allowance payment in addition to another social welfare payment, which cost &euro;310,000. These campaigns were advertised on a range of media including TV, radio, newspapers &amp; magazines at a combined cost of &euro;910,000.</P>
        <P>In October and December 2007, advertisements were also placed in the newspapers inviting submissions from the public in relation to the Green Paper on Pensions; and in November 2007 on an equality review of the social welfare code at a combined cost of &euro;268,000. In 2007, advertisements were placed in the print media to inform the public of the Department&rsquo;s PRSI emailing service and the budget 2008 enquiry line. General advertising costs amounted to &euro;132,000 in 2007.</P>
        <P>Details of the activities undertaken and the amount spent for the periods in question are available to the Deputies in tabular form.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 130 together.</P>
        <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is the main Government funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems. There are 53 independent companies nationwide with over 240 money advice staff operating the service. Almost &euro;18 million has been provided in 2008 to assist the MABS in dealing with its workload.</P>
        <P>Last year, MABS provided services to over 12,400 new clients throughout the country. To date this year almost 12,400 new clients have approached the service. The MABS National Telephone Helpline which was launched in October 2007 has dealt to date with approximately 9,000 calls. The statistics for 2008 indicate that the average debt owed by new clients when they first approached MABS was &euro;11,600. In 2007 the average debt was &euro;7,600.</P>
        <P>The reasons for the debt difficulties that people encounter are complicated.  The statistical information from MABSIS and research studies are key to understanding the nature and cause of over-indebtedness and in formulating appropriate policy responses.</P>
        <P>People approach MABS with debt owed to a range of creditors. For example of the total debt owed by the 12,393 new clients that approached MABS to end of September 2008, 63% was owed to banks and financial institutions, 17 % to Credit Unions, 3 % to Utilities, and 2% to Moneylenders. The issues that give rise to over indebtedness for people are highly complex. Research such as the policy statement &lsquo;Tackling Financial Exclusion in Ireland&rsquo; published by the Combat Poverty Agency has an important contribution to make to increasing knowledge and understanding of the causes of debt and the meaning of financial exclusion for people on low incomes. The research shows that lack of information about money management can be a contributory factor in many cases. The cost and availability of credit for people on low incomes and the barriers they face in accessing mainstream and cheap forms of credit add to the difficulties people encounter in managing their finances.</P>
        <P>My view is that MABS has a unique and expert contribution to make in meeting the needs of people with debt difficulties in today&rsquo;s society. This includes promoting greater awareness about household budgeting and shaping strategies, especially those of services providers, such as the banks and the credit unions, to ensure greater financial inclusion in Ireland. The MABS continues to work closely with the Financial Regulator in developing initiatives in this regard. For example, recently I launched an education programme on money management for Transition Year students which was developed by MABS and the Financial Regulator and will be rolled out to schools this autumn.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Deputies&rsquo; concerns about the impact of rising fuel and energy costs. My own priority, as Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is to ensure that Government assistance is available to those who need our help the most, older people, those with disabilities or serious illnesses, and people on low incomes. </P>
        <P>Government policy in recent years, has focused on increasing primary social welfare rates significantly to ensure that people on social welfare can meet their basic living costs, including heating costs throughout the year.</P>
        <P>Since December 2001, overall inflation has increased by 28% while energy product prices have increased by 74%. However, increases in social welfare payments have been between 71% and 88% in the same period.</P>
        <P>These payments are intended to cover general basic living costs, including some heating costs. In addition, the fuel allowance is paid to almost 300,000 people, while 357,000 receive electricity or gas allowances, at a combined cost of approximately &euro;340 million.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements have been made to both schemes in recent years:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The value of the fuel allowance has been doubled since 2005 to &euro;18 per week or &euro; 21.90 for recipients living in designated smokeless areas;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The number of weeks for which the fuel allowance is paid has been extended to 30; and</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In January 2007 the number of units covered by the electricity allowance was increased from 1,800 to 2,400.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In August 2008 the value of the electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package increased to &euro;540 per annum and are payable throughout the year to over 357,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs at an estimated overall scheme cost of &euro;170m in 2008.</P>
        <P>Budget 2009 increased the fuel allowance by a further &euro;2 per week and extended the season by 2 weeks to 32 weeks. These improvements will bring the annual cost of the scheme to &euro;205m. The Budget also provided for further increases in basic social welfare payments next year.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme can also be used to assist people, in certain circumstances, with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition.</P>
        <P>Of course income support and advice, while very important, is only part of the answer in terms of reducing fuel poverty. Proper household insulation is absolutely vital. Initiatives such as the Warmer Homes Scheme, operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have a very valuable role to play in that regard, as does funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to improve the quality of existing local authority housing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Co-ordination of the work of the relevant Departments and agencies is crucial to ensuring the effective delivery of a comprehensive approach to tackling fuel poverty. While various bodies have significantly increased the resources they are directing at fuel poverty initiatives in recent years, the establishment of an inter-departmental group on energy affordability has helped to ensure that we are working closer together to maximise the potential of our collective efforts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio. It has recently convened this inter- Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy, co-chaired with the Office for Social Inclusion of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, to co-ordinate and drive Government policy in this area. The Group includes officials of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, <Col N="382"/>Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Health and Children, the Commission for Energy Regulation, Sustainable Energy Ireland, the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is. The objective is to ensure shared understanding of the challenges and actions underway and to ensure a fully cohesive strategic approach to delivery of affordable energy initiatives and programmes.  The Group will report to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, Children and Integration and the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security Infrastructure.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121, 137 and 152 together. </P>
        <P>There is no delay in processing the majority of Child Benefit applications.  Awards on behalf of Irish born children are processed either automatically or in a partially automated way using the child&rsquo;s birth details when they are registered with the General Registrar&rsquo;s Office.  The average processing time for these claims is 10 days.  Payments on behalf of some 65,000 children were paid this way in 2007.</P>
        <P>Currently there are delays in processing Child Benefit claims for children born outside Ireland who have come to live in Ireland with their parents, and also claims for children who reside in another EU member state but have an entitlement to Irish Child Benefit under EU regulations (non-resident children).</P>
        <P>In the case of non-Irish born children resident in Ireland, these cases are slower to process as the customer must satisfy the Habitual Residency condition test and this may entail contacting employers, the Department of Justice and other relevant bodies to confirm their status in the state. The residence of the children in Ireland must also be confirmed. This additional complexity, combined with an increase in the volume of applications received in recent years, has led to arrears of claims to be processed, which is currently being addressed. There is a total of 7,500 such claims awaiting processing, with a further 1,600 cases where the Department is waiting on additional information to finalise the claims.  Additional staff resources have been assigned to this area and it is envisaged that all claims on hand will be cleared in the early part of 2009.  Average processing time for these claims at present is 10 months.</P>
        <P>EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country may have an entitlement to Family Benefits in Ireland under EU Regulation 1408/71.</P>
        <P>Before payment of Child Benefit is made for these non-resident children it is necessary amongst other things,  to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable in the home country as this will determine entitlement to Irish payments. This process can take a number of months to complete in normal circumstances.</P><Col N="383"/>
        <P>There are some 11,500 claims in respect of non-resident children on hand and awaiting finalising.  These claims are being processed with the assistance of additional temporary staff recruited for this purpose.  It is anticipated that these claims will be cleared during the first half of 2009.  At this point it is taking an average of 18 months to process these claims to completion.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Over 45,500 rent supplements have been awarded since January 2008. </P>
        <P>In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods. There are currently over 68,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 14% since the end of December 2007. Almost 32,000 are getting a supplement for 18 months or more. For this reason, the rent supplement scheme has to be viewed in the context of overall housing policy, particularly in the case of long-term recipients.</P>
        <P>The Government introduced new rental assistance arrangements which came into effect in 2005 and included the rental accommodation scheme (RAS). The RAS gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more, on a phased implementation basis. Since 2005, over 8,300 rent supplement recipients have been transferred to RAS units and a further 7,500 have transferred to other social housing options, following their assessment for RAS.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements to the means test for rent supplement were implemented in 2007 specifically to facilitate people returning to full-time work who had been accepted as eligible for accommodation under RAS. These measures are positive steps in assisting tenants in achieving a long-term housing solution for their needs.</P>
        <P>Other improvements to the rent supplement means test were implemented in June 2007 providing for a gradual withdrawal of the supplement as hours of employment or earnings increase. Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to part-time work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum weekly contribution which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. When last set in 2004, the minimum contribution represented approximately 10% of the minimum social welfare weekly payment rate. While social welfare payments have risen by nearly &euro;70 per week since then, no upward adjustment has been made to the minimum contribution.</P>
        <P>As part of Budget 2009, I announced my intention to increase the minimum contribution from &euro;13 to &euro;18 with effect from 1 January 2009 which will represent 8.8% of the basic social welfare weekly payment. It will also significantly reduce the differential between the contribution which rent supplement tenants pay and the contribution payable under the local authority differential rent scheme.</P><Col N="384"/>
        <P>The fact that there are over 68,000 people receiving rent supplement and the fact that over 45,000 rent supplements were awarded since the beginning of this year indicate that the scheme is effective in meeting needs. However, I intend to keep the rent supplement scheme under review and the Department will continue working closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government discussion paper, &ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents,&rdquo; put forward proposals to tackle obstacles to employment for lone parents and other low income families. These included proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.     Under the proposals the lone parenthood category of payment would no longer exist. Instead, a new payment would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner), with young children, on low income. This new payment is currently being developed in the Department, taking into account the various issues raised in the consultation process. </P>
        <P>Any proposed new payment scheme can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place on the ground by other relevant Departments and Agencies. This is why the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion has been tasked with bringing forward a plan on the key issues of childcare, education, training and activation measures.</P>
        <P>The non-income recommendations contained in the discussion paper were examined in two areas: Coolock and Kilkenny. These studies, which took place between November 2007 and February 2008, were carried out to facilitate the development of the policy and operational details of the new scheme. The process involved both lone parents and qualified adults. It was carried out on a voluntary basis and the take-up was low.</P>
        <P>The experience has however highlighted how both lone parents and qualified adults are not a homogenous group, are of different ages, have experienced different routes into their current situation and have different needs. Educational levels of those who participated were generally low, there was little or no engagement with F&Aacute;S, some participants intended to return to full or part-time work when their child was a few months old; others, however, had been out of the work force for a considerable period of time. Earnings from previous employment were generally low. For almost all of those intending to return to work affordable childcare was a critical issue.</P>
        <P>The experience of this engagement process is feeding into the development of our approach to working with lone parents and qualified adults to support them into education, training and employment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 165 and 175 together. </P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s role is to assist social welfare recipients with heating costs, both through their basic payments and through the household benefits package with fuel, electricity and gas allowances. These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.</P>
        <P>The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.</P><Col N="386"/>
        <P>Electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package, are payable throughout the year to 358,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs at an estimated overall scheme cost of &euro;159m in 2008. The value of the electricity/gas allowance was increased to &euro;540 a year from 1 August 2008 in line with increases in the price of electricity and gas.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme can also be used to assist people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition. Budget 2009 provided for an increase in fuel allowance of &euro;2 to &euro;20 (&euro;23.90 in designated smokeless zones) per week from January 2009, benefiting almost 300,000 households. This is an 11% increase on the current rate of payment. The duration of the fuel season is being increased by 2 weeks from April 2009 bringing the total period for which fuel allowance is paid to 32 weeks. The additional annual cost of the fuel allowance measures is &euro;30m bringing total annual expenditure on the scheme to &euro;205m in 2009.</P>
        <P>I will keep all aspects of the fuel scheme under review including the issue of a lump sum payment.</P>

	<P>Social welfare spending has been prioritised in this Budget. Next year, total funding for the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be &euro;19.6 billion. This represents an increase of &euro;2.6 billion or 15.5% over the Estimates allocation for 2008.  Over 1.7 million people and their dependents will benefit from this expenditure.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, it has been necessary to take some steps to reduce expenditure but these have been kept to the absolute minimum and applied in a careful manner.  Where possible, associated measures will also be implemented to alleviate the impact on persons affected by the measures, especially social welfare dependent families.  Most of the proposed measures relate to changes in the eligibility criteria for social insurance based schemes and, in these cases, the most vulnerable people will normally be entitled to a means tested social assistance payment instead.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the Estimates published on Budget day provide for significant savings next year in various areas of the Department&rsquo;s administrative expenditure including travel and subsistence, postage, consultancy services and advertising.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129, 166 and 171 together.</P>
        <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to cover the cost of sending children to school, rather, as the name suggests, it is intended to assist with clothing and footwear expenses.</P>
        <P>A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment (including family income supplement), or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels. The purpose of the household income limit is to ensure that the allowance is directed at those with the greatest need.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2009, I have increased the income thresholds for entitlement to back to school clothing and footwear allowance by &euro;50. This will bring the income limits for the allowance for parents with one child to &euro;559.80 (for couples) and &euro;406.30 for lone parents. This will enable an estimated 18,000 more families to benefit from the scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition, I also propose to increase the amount of back to school clothing and footwear allowance by &euro;215 to &euro;520 per annum payable for eligible 18 year olds, as a compensatory measure where child benefit is no longer payable.</P>
        <P>The rates of back to school clothing and footwear allowance have been increased significantly in recent years. Since 2005, the allowance has increased from &euro;80 to &euro;200 in respect of qualified children aged from 2 to 11 years and from &euro;150 to &euro;305 for those aged 12 to 22. These are increases of 150% and 103% respectively.</P>
        <P>The number of children benefiting from the allowance increased from 161,000 in 2006 to over 180,000 in 2007. Current indications are that about 98,000 families with over 190,000 children benefited from the scheme in 2008 at a cost of over &euro;48m. The increased numbers can be mainly attributed to improvements introduced in recent years and to the significant level of <Col N="388"/>publicity given to this scheme in the media and through the other information services operated by the Department.</P>
        <P>The improvements in BSCFA rates in recent years are very significant when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends. According to the Consumer Price Index for September 2008, the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen by 5% over the past twelve months. Since December 2001, clothing and footwear costs have decreased by 22%.</P>
        <P>I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain. The improvements to the scheme in recent years and the improvements announced by me in Budget 2009, provide a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 156 together.</P>
        <P>The Pensions Act provides for a minimum Funding Standard which defined benefit pension schemes must meet on an ongoing basis. Generally speaking, the Standard requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them to discharge accrued liabilities in the event of a scheme winding up. Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding.</P>
        <P>In 2007, 81% of defined benefit schemes reporting to the Pensions Board passed the Funding Standard, with most of those failing the test of having a funding proposal in place to restore full funding.  However, it is expected that the number of schemes failing the funding standard will increase significantly in the coming year, but the extent of the problem will not be fully apparent until schemes carry out end of scheme year actuarial assessments and report the results to the Pensions Board.</P>
        <P>The operation of the Funding Standard is discussed in the Green Paper on pensions and any changes proposed will be announced in the context of the overall framework for pensions which the Government has indicated it will announce by the end of the year.  However, given current market conditions and the difficulties these pose for schemes in trying to devise their funding proposals, I asked the Pensions Board to allow additional time for the preparation of funding proposals, as a temporary measure. This should provide schemes with sufficient time to deal with the issues in an orderly manner. In addition to this, the Pensions Board are continuing to consider the issues involved for schemes which are experiencing difficulties in returning <Col N="389"/>to a fully-funded position.     There is no doubt that the current situation is causing serious difficulties for defined benefit pension schemes. The Department is working with the Pensions Board and representative organisations to find ways to ease the pressure on schemes. However, in considering any amendments to the funding standard there is a very difficult balance to be struck between the long-term nature of pension savings and the need, as far as we can, to ensure the short-term security of the benefits already accrued by employees in a scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 149 together. </P>
        <P>The Government discussion paper, &ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents,&rdquo; put forward proposals to tackle obstacles to employment for lone parents and other low income families.</P>
        <P>Under the proposals the lone parenthood category of payment would no longer exist.  Instead, a new payment would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner), with young children, on low income.  	</P>
        <P>The non-income recommendations contained in the discussion paper were examined in two areas: Coolock and Kilkenny.  These studies, which took place between November 2007 and February 2008, were carried out to facilitate the development of the policy and operational details of the new scheme.  The process involved both lone parents and qualified adults. It was carried out on a voluntary basis and the take-up was low.</P>
        <P>The experience has however highlighted how both lone parents and qualified adults are not a homogenous group, are of different ages, have experienced different routes into their current situation and have different needs. Educational levels of those who participated were generally low, there was little or no engagement with F&Aacute;S, some participants intended to return to full or part-time work when their child was a few months old; others, however, had been out of the work force for a considerable period of time. Earnings from previous employment were generally low. In Kilkenny access to transport was an issue with regard to taking up employment or training, with those outside the city of Kilkenny having problems in this regard. For almost all of those intending to return to work affordable childcare is a critical issue.</P>
        <P>The experience of this engagement process is feeding into the development of our approach to working with lone parents and qualified adults to support them into education, training and employment.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the expected saving to the Exchequer from each of the various measures announced in Budget 2009 in respect of reducing entitlement to a jobseekers payment. </Quest>
        <QRef>[35627/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system is based on two quite different types of entitlement &mdash; a social insurance system for people who have paid sufficient PRSI contributions and a social assistance system for people without adequate contributions who have little or no household means of their own.</P><Col N="390"/>
        <P>Social insurance is intended both to enable people to insure themselves against adverse life events such as illness or unemployment and to provide for their state pensions and other benefits, through contributions to the national Social Insurance Fund. Social insurance benefits are not means-tested. Instead, entitlement depends on having paid the required number of PRSI contributions relevant to the particular benefit you wish to claim.</P>
        <P>For the past eleven years, the Social Insurance Fund has been in surplus, with more than sufficient income to the fund to cover the payments being made from it each year, without the State having to provide a subsidy. However, that is changing.  As a result of further increases in the live register, expenditure is expected to exceed income to the Fund by over &euro;200 million this year and about &euro;900 million next year.  Although these current deficits can be met from the accumulated surplus, it looks likely that the Exchequer may yet again have to subsidize expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund within a few years.</P>
        <P>In that context, it is appropriate to look at some of the instances where people with a very limited or distant contribution record have been able to qualify for very significant benefits, regardless of their household income.  Currently, people who have paid just 52 contributions in total can qualify for Jobseekers Benefit, Illness Benefit and Health and Safety Benefit.</P>
        <P>This means, for example, that migrants or young workers who have only worked here for a total of one year are entitled to claim job seekers payments for 12 months, without having to satisfy a means test.  This will change from next January, when the number of required paid contributions will be doubled to 104 for new claimants.  This change is expected to result in savings of &euro;7m in 2009 and &euro;12.8m in 2010 on the Jobseekers Benefit scheme.</P>
        <P>A further anomaly that exists at present is that some people, who were previously working part-time, can receive a higher rate of payment from these schemes than what they were actually earning whilst at work.  Again, this is considered to be inappropriate &mdash; a disincentive to employment &mdash; and so, and from next January, this situation will be addressed by increasing the earnings thresholds which currently apply to the reduced or graduated rates of payment from &euro;150 to &euro;300 per week.  This change is expected to result in savings of &euro;2.3m in 2009 and &euro;3.4m in 2010 on the Jobseekers Benefit scheme.</P>
        <P>At present, it is necessary to have made 13 paid contributions in the relevant tax year in order to qualify for Illness Benefit. However, `this condition does not exist for Jobseekers Benefit, with the result that people who may not have paid PRSI contributions in the past number of years can qualify.  Again, it is considered that this position does not adequately reflect the contribution-based rationale for social insurance and so from next January, new claimants for Jobseekers Benefit will be required to satisfy the same conditions as those on Illness Benefit and must have paid 13 contributions in the relevant tax year.  This change is expected to result in savings of &euro;2.2m in 2009 and &euro;5.3m in 2010 on the Jobseekers Benefit scheme.</P>
        <P>The other two changes being made to Jobseekers Benefit relate to the duration of the payment.  At present, people who have 260 or more paid social insurance contributions can receive Jobseekers Benefit for up to 15 months.  As of today, this is being limited to 12 months for current claimants with less than six months duration on the scheme as well as all new claimants.  This change is expected to result in savings of &euro;37m in 2009 and &euro;61m in 2010 on the Jobseekers Benefit scheme.  Where the claimant has less than 260 paid contributions, the maximum duration of Jobseekers Benefit will be 9 months (instead of 12 months) if the claimant currently has been in receipt of benefit for less than three months and in respect of all new claimants. This change is expected to result in savings of &euro;16m in 2009 and &euro;25m in 2010 on the Jobseekers Benefit scheme.</P><Col N="391"/>
        <P>In summary, new claimants for Jobseekers Benefit will in future have to have paid a total of at least 104 contributions to the Social Insurance Fund, with at least 13 of these paid in the relevant tax year.  The rate of payment will more closely reflect what the individual was earning prior to becoming unemployed and the duration of the payment will be either 12 or 9 months depending on the number of social insurance contributions they have made in the past.</P>
        <P>The savings referred to above will accrue to the Social Insurance Fund rather than directly to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>I would like to stress that people who will be affected by these changes will be able to claim Jobseekers Allowance or Supplementary Welfare Allowance instead, if they have limited means.  The maximum rate of these two schemes is paid at the same rate as Jobseekers Benefit.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  There are over 68,000 people in receipt of rent supplement of which almost 32,000 are getting a supplement for 18 months or more.  Numbers on rent supplement have increased by 14% since the end of December 2007.</P>
        <P>Similarly, mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  There are currently 6,600 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, a 60% increase on the numbers receiving the supplement at the end of December 2007.</P>
        <P>In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods, including people on local authority housing waiting lists.  The scheme was not designed to meet long-term ongoing housing needs.  One of the measures introduced to address the issue of long-term rent supplementation is the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) which gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the long-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for eighteen months or more.  Over 8,300 tenants have been transferred from the rent supplement scheme to RAS since 2005 and a further 7,500 rent supplement recipients were provided with social housing following their assessment for RAS. 		</P>
        <P>Provision was made in 2007 to enable people on rent supplement and accepted as eligible for accommodation under RAS to return to full-time work, without losing the entire rent supplement payment.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements to the means test for rent and mortgage interest supplement were implemented in 2007.  The assessment of means for rent and mortgage interest supplement now provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. <Col N="392"/> Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive rent or mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  Since June 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</P>
        <P>These measures are positive steps in assisting tenants in achieving a long-term housing solution for their needs while also increasing the financial return from employment for those returning to work or moving to full-time employment.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the current rent and mortgage interest supplement scheme provides an adequate short-term &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; within the overall social welfare system to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment.  Nonetheless I intend to keep the schemes under review to ensure that they meet the objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis while long-term housing needs are dealt with in a more appropriate manner.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 151, 177, 441 and 442 together.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to providing a high quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  These con<Col N="393"/>ditions vary between the two jobseeker schemes and involve, among other things, the need to establish the person&rsquo;s social insurance record, establish the person&rsquo;s identity or their place of habitual residence and to assess means where appropriate.  In some cases delays arise where the person fails to supply all pertinent information in support of their application.</P>
        <P>The standard for claim processing is 70% of jobseekers allowance claims and 85% of jobseekers benefit claims to be processed in 2 weeks.  Due to the sharp rise in the numbers claiming a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, this standard is not being met.  The average time for applications processed in September was 3 weeks for jobseekers benefit claims and 6 weeks for jobseekers allowance claims.  This compares to 2 weeks for jobseekers benefit and 3 weeks for jobseekers allowance claims in September 2006 and September 2007.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that anyone who is under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on their claim for a jobseekers payment can apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance which is subject to a means test and other qualifying conditions.</P>
        <P>The Department delivers a frontline service through a network of 61 Local Offices and 64 Branch Offices countrywide.  Local Offices are staffed by civil servants whereas the Branch Offices operate under a contract for service.  All decisions on claims are made in the Local Office.</P>
        <P>The overall performance in any individual office in processing claims can be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors; including increased inflow of claims, staff vacancies and the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office.</P>
        <P>The Department has put a range of measures in place to deal with the extra workload arising from the increase in the Live Register.  These include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />additional posts assigned from other parts of the Dept; &mdash; use of temporary staff to fill vacancies;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />extension of temporary staff contracts in certain offices;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />increased overtime; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />prioritisation of work.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">These measures are being reviewed on a continuous basis.</P>
        <P>A total of 21,437 jobseekers benefit claims and 10,224 jobseekers allowance claims were processed in September 2008.  The corresponding figures for 2006 and 2007 are as follows:</P>

	<P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 139 and 143 together.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, a review of the Combat Poverty Agency was undertaken on foot of a Government decision on the 6th of June 2007.  The purpose of the review was to examine the role of the Agency in light of the emergence since 1986 of comprehensive strategies and new institutional arrangements to promote social inclusion (such as the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, the Office for Social Inclusion and the voluntary pillar in Social Partnership).</P>
        <P>The Government, having considered the review report, has decided to integrate the Combat Poverty Agency with the Office for Social Inclusion within the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It is not my intention that Combat Poverty will simply be absorbed into the Office for Social Inclusion in its existing form. Rather a new strengthened division will be created which will make the best use of the considerable experience and expertise of the staff of both existing bodies and will seek to address the weaknesses identified by the Review in relation to both.  I believe that this new division will provide a stronger voice for those affected by poverty and social inclusion issues.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the concerns about the need for independent scrutiny of public policy that have been expressed by some interest groups.  I absolutely agree that independent critique is very important and this move is no way intended to reduce the scope for such work.</P>
        <P>As the review report notes, the function of independent reporting on poverty is no longer as dependent on Combat Poverty as it was in earlier years.  This is due for example to the emergence of other independent data sources such as the statistics on poverty reported by the CSO, and independent analysis by bodies such as the ESRI and NESC and on the international front by the EU and OECD.  And of course, Ireland is well-served by the social partners, and a wide range of NGOs and other groups who have a strong voice in public debate about poverty and related issues.</P>
        <P>Procedures will be put in place to ensure that the views of these and other stakeholders, including people experiencing poverty, continue to be available to Government in developing and monitoring the social inclusion strategies.</P>
        <P>Combining two organisations will naturally result in savings to the Exchequer, for example, in the areas of accommodation and support services.  The extent and timing of savings will be identified and dealt with as part of the implementation of the Government decision which is underway.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> her view of the Combat Poverty Agency Report entitled, Tackling Health Inequalities &mdash; An All-Ireland Approach to Social Determinants; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>This report, Tackling Health Inequalities &mdash; A Social Determinants Approach, shows how social, economic and environmental conditions play a major role in determining health in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Combat Poverty and the Institute of Public Health in Ireland jointly published this all-Ireland report, which makes a major contribution to our understanding of this subject.  Full account of the findings of the report will be taken in future policy development. </P>
        <P>Reducing health inequalities caused by social and economic conditions requires a comprehensive strategy across all relevant policy areas to reduce and in time eliminate poverty.  Such <Col N="398"/>a strategy is provided for in the National Action Plan for social inclusion, 2007 to 2016 and in a dedicated chapter on social inclusion in the National Development Plan.</P>
        <P>Key objectives include increasing employment participation which provides the main path out of poverty, and steadily improving income support in real terms and access to essential services.  The National Action Plan on inclusion contains 12 high level goals and over 150 targets to meet these broad objectives.</P>
        <P>The overall goal of the NAPinclusion is to reduce the proportion of the population experiencing consistent poverty to between 2% and 4% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.  The latest results from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, released last November, indicate that the Government is on target to achieve this goal.  It showed that the rate of consistent poverty in the population in 2006 was 6.5 per cent, down from 7.0 per cent in 2005 and 8.2 per cent in 2003.</P>
        <P>Progress in implementing the plan and meeting its goals and targets will, in light of this report, significantly help also to reduce health inequalities.</P>

        <Quest> the proposals she has made to Government to merge the employment services section of F&Aacute;S with her Department. </Quest>

	<P>There are no plans to merge the Employment Support Services of F&Aacute;S with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  F&Aacute;S and the Department work together in a complementary way and I have not made any such proposals to the Government on behalf of people on social welfare payments. </P>
        <P>A high degree of cooperation and coordination exists at both policy and operational level between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and F&Aacute;S. Both sides operate under a memorandum of understanding which is updated periodically.  Senior officials of the department hold regular joint meetings with F&Aacute;S and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.  There are also regular meetings between officials of the Department and F&Aacute;S at regional and local level.</P>
        <P>The Department works closely with F&Aacute;S in providing opportunities for people on social welfare to access the range of training and employment services afforded by that organisation.  An important area of this cooperation is in relation to the joint National Employment Action Plan whereby people are referred to F&Aacute;S when they reach 3 months on the live register.</P>
        <P>Provision has also been made in the National Development Plan for a Social and Economic Participation Programme aimed at all people of working age on welfare regardless of the circumstances that led them to require income maintenance.  The Activation sub-programme of the National Development Plan involves the Department of Social and Family Affairs, in co-operation with the relevant agencies such as F&Aacute;S, VECs, HSE and other local agencies engaging on an individual case basis with those people on welfare who are not progressing into employment or accessing training or employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>The main element of the National Development Plans Activation sub-programme is to expand the Department&rsquo;s facilitator service with each facilitator having a defined work programme.  A &ldquo;Disability Employment Project&rdquo; commenced in 2008 under the European Social Fund; this involves the Department working with F&Aacute;S and other agencies to support people with Disabilities in reaching their potential.</P><Col N="399"/>
        <P>These initiatives are being undertaken in response to the Department&rsquo;s recognition that social welfare payments require to be supplemented by activation measures to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the existing arrangements with F&Aacute;S together with the supporting activation measures undertaken by the Department ensure that the social and economic progression of those most marginalised are being adequately addressed.</P>

	<P>The Department collects information from people on the Live Register to establish entitlement to payments, to ensure that conditions for receipt of payment continue to be satisfied and to assist in the activation of those who are not progressing into employment or accessing training opportunities. </P>
        <P>The Live Register is profiled by scheme type, gender, age, duration on the Live Register, nationality, occupations, regions and local office.  Composition of the Live Register can also be profiled with reference to whether or not a registrant receives a payment and by reasons for not receiving a payment.</P>
        <P>In September 2006 the Department and the ERSI initiated a major profiling study of the Live Register, this following on from earlier research in this area.  Its aim is to develop a model which could facilitate the introduction of a system to identify people at the point when they first register as unemployed who are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  Over a 13 week period from 11 September 2006, additional profile information was gathered nationally, on a voluntary basis, from 45,000 customers who made unemployment claims.  Since then, the claim status of each of these customers has been monitored by the project team in the Department.</P>
        <P>A profiling system would facilitate early, targeted interventions for those who need them most, while not devoting resources to providing interventions to those who will progress of their own accord.  Introducing a profiling system would be a major undertaking, requiring primary legislation and substantial changes in procedures and schemes, both within the Department of Social and Family Affairs and in other agencies that provide services to people on social welfare. The scale of change is such that it would necessarily take some to time to implement.</P>
        <P>The final report from the ESRI is due at the end of 2008.  When the report is received, it will receive detailed consideration.</P>

        <Quest> if there has been an increase in the number of families applying for the family income supplement in the past six months; if her Department has estimates for the number of families entitled to FIS not currently receiving this supplement; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department has consistently publicised the FIS scheme in order to maximise uptake by qualified families.  Significant <Col N="400"/>improvements in the qualifying income limits and ongoing awareness campaigns have resulted in a strong upward trend in the levels of claims received.</P>
        <P>There are currently some 26,000 people in receipt of a weekly FIS payment. In 2007 the Department received 36,900 new and renewal FIS claims, compared to 33,000 in 2006 and 23,000 in 2005 &mdash; an increase of over 60% on 2005 and 11% on 2006.  In the first 9 months of 2008 almost 33,100 claims were received compared to 29,500 in the same period in 2007 &mdash; an increase of over 14%.</P>
        <P>With regard to the level of take up, it is not possible to estimate from administrative sources the number of families who would be eligible but do not apply for their FIS entitlements.  However, the department has commissioned a research project to examine factors behind the level of take up for the scheme.  I expect this project to be completed in the coming months.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> the reason for her decision not to increase the maximum rents allowed under rent supplement following the recent review. </Quest>
        <QRef>[34858/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that a person may incur. Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.</P>
        <P>Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels.  This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.</P>
        <P>A review of rent limits was undertaken earlier this year.  The review was informed by analysis of data sourced from the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the Community Welfare Service and by the views of statutory and voluntary agencies working in this area.</P>
        <P>Data provided by the CSO indicates that the increase in private rent levels began to decelerate at the beginning of 2008 and rent levels declined by almost 5% by August of this year.  This deceleration in rent levels is also reflected in the Daft.ie rental reports where a decrease of over 5% was reported in the first half of 2008.  It is also reported that the supply of available rental accommodation has more than doubled in the last year.</P>
        <P>Given the current downward trend in private rent levels and the fact that the overall housing market is currently in a period of adjustment, increasing rent limits in the rent supplement scheme would send an inappropriate signal to the market where a third or so of private sector tenants receive rent supplement.  In these circumstances, it was decided to retain rent limits at their current levels.</P>
        <P>There is no hard evidence at this time that the prescribed upper limits on rent levels supported under the rent supplement scheme are having a detrimental impact on the ability of eligible tenants generally to secure suitable rented accommodation to meet their needs.  There are currently over 68,200 rent supplements in payment.  Over 45,500 rent supplements have <Col N="401"/>been awarded since January 2008.  This suggests that the rent limits are set at reasonable levels at present.</P>
        <P>Rent levels will continue to be monitored particularly for households who may find it difficult to secure or retain accommodation within the limits in certain areas. The position will be reviewed in 2009 when the results of the latest Private Rented Index report published by the CSO will be analysed for impact on rent limits.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has flexibility to award rent supplement above or below rent limits, having regard to local rent levels or to meet the particular needs of an individual.  These discretionary powers ensure that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.</P>

	<P>The Department was notified in April 2007 that a laptop, belonging to the C&amp;AG, had been taken from our offices.  The theft was immediately reported to the Garda&iacute;.  Some 16 months later, in early August, the Department was informed that the laptop contained personal data relating to social welfare customers. </P>
        <P>The Department reported this matter to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation (which deals with Computer Crime) and sought advice and guidance in that regard. I am not in a position to confirm the status of any criminal investigation.</P>
        <P>The office of the C&amp;AG was provided with access to the Department&rsquo;s records to enable them to carry out audits of our schemes.  The data, which was stored in encoded format on our internal ICT network, was downloaded by a member of the C&amp;AG audit team to a laptop where it was decoded.  The decoded data was on the laptop when it went missing.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that the laptop in question contained the records of 380,000 customers.  The records contained personal information, including Name, PPSN, Address, Pay Amount and other personal information such as marital status, date of birth etc.  They also contained bank account details in respect of those customers whose payments were made directly into their bank accounts during the periods in question.</P>
        <P>The information contained on the laptop, alone, would not be sufficient to access public services.  Public bodies, employers and others who are authorised to use the PPS Number are required to exercise diligence in properly identifying those whom they employ or with whom they transact business.  Additional evidence of identity such as photographic ID, signature, mother&rsquo;s birth surname, PIN, password, etc. is required to fulfil this purpose.</P>
        <P>In view of the time period that has elapsed and the fact that there is no evidence that the information has been misused or compromised in any way, the Department does not consider it necessary or appropriate to issue new PPS numbers to all of the customers affected.  The Department has facilitated requests from individual customers to have their PPS Numbers changed.  From contacts with the Garda&iacute;, various other Government and payment institutions <Col N="402"/>there is no indication of any systematic misuse of the information contained on the laptop in the 17 months since the theft occurred.  Accordingly, the question of compensation does not arise as there is no evidence of any injury, loss or damage having been suffered arising from this incident.</P>
        <P>Since being notified of the contents of the laptop on 1 August, 2008, the Department moved swiftly to respond to the incident and has taken all reasonable steps to minimise the concerns of the customers whose records were contained on it.  Letters issued to customers informing them of the incident, a helpline was set up to answer any enquiries arising from this matter, an email address and a Post Office Box Number was provided for written enquiries.  In addition, the Department engaged with the C&amp;AG, the Data Protection Commissioner, An Post, banks and other financial institutions.</P>
        <P>The Department has a programme of continuous development and deployment of measures to enhance data security.  Since this incident came to light, the Department has further reviewed and enhanced its protocols in relation to the transfer of data to third parties, including the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG).  All bulk data is now transferred in an encrypted format, in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;External Party Electronic Data Transfer Policy&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s policy is that sensitive data should not be stored on laptops.  However, in the event that there is no alternative to local storage, all sensitive data must be appropriately secured.  All new laptops are issued with encryption software.  The Department is currently arranging a recall of its current stock of laptops to install encryption software.  This process is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 170 together.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of mortgage interest.  The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement is to provide short term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  The scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department.</P>
        <P>One of the statutory conditions for receipt of mortgage interest supplement is that, in the opinion of the HSE, the person must have been in a position, at the time the loan agreement was entered into, to meet the repayments under that agreement (Article  10(1)(b)(i) of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Welfare Allowance) Regulations 2007).  Accordingly, in determining entitlement to mortgage interest supplement, a community welfare officer may examine the original loan application, supporting documentation and records of repayments in order to assess the capacity of the person to make a long-term commitment to repay<Col N="403"/>ment of the loan in question.  It is a matter for the community welfare officer to a make a decision on entitlement based on all of the facts of the case.  There is a right of appeal against the decision of the community welfare officer to a Health Service Executive Appeals Officer and thereafter to the Chief Appeals Officer of the Department.</P>
        <P>The supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance, appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
        <P>The existing mortgage interest supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  In recent years improvements have been made to the means test to encourage eligible people to engage in employment without losing their entire mortgage interest supplement.</P>
        <P>Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  Since June 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</P>
        <P>Mortgage interest supplement recipients are required to make a minimum contribution towards the cost of their accommodation costs.  When last set in 2004, the contribution represented approximately 10% of the minimum social welfare weekly payment rate.  While basic social welfare rates of payment have risen by nearly &euro;70 per week since then, no upward adjustment has been made to the minimum contribution.  As part of Budget 2009 measures, I announced my intention to increase the minimum contribution from &euro;13 to &euro;18 with effect from 1 January 2009.  This contribution which represents 8.8% of the basic social welfare weekly payment is significantly less than the minimum rent paid by many local authority tenants.</P>
        <P>There are currently 6,600 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, a 60% increase on the numbers receiving the supplement at the end of December 2007.</P>
        <P>The mortgage interest supplement schemes provide an adequate short-term &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; within the overall social welfare system to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment.  I do not consider that any further changes in eligibility criteria are required at this time.  However the scheme will be kept under review to ensure that it meets the objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis.</P>

	<P>The Guardians&rsquo; payment schemes allow for the provision of a weekly allowance to a guardian of a child who has either been orphaned or whose parents have abandoned and failed to provide for the child.  Section 2(1) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 defines an orphan as a qualified child&mdash;</P>
<P el="5">a. <Miles com="ix" />both of whose parents are dead, or</P>
<P el="5">b. <Miles com="ix" />one of whose parents is dead or unknown or has abandoned and failed to provide for the child, as the case may be, and whose other parent&mdash;</P>
<P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="is0p2" />i.  <Miles com="ix" />is unknown, or</P>
<P LI="2" el="5">ii.  <Miles com="ix" />has abandoned and failed to provide for the child,  where that child is not residing with a parent, adoptive parent or step-parent. </P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">All claims for Guardian&rsquo;s payment are decided by a Deciding Officer appointed by the Minister under Section 299 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005.  Prior to decision, claims are referred to a Social Welfare Inspector in order to establish if the conditions of entitlement are fulfilled.  The Social Welfare Inspector completes a report on all relevant issues and this report is then referred to the Deciding Officer to make a decision on the claim.</P>
        <P>A parent&rsquo;s committal to prison alone is not considered a sufficient qualifying criterion to satisfy the legislative definition of orphan. Each case is decided based on the individual circumstances.  Factors such as the length of incarceration, the previous and continuing level of contact with the child and the level of the parents&rsquo; involvement in the welfare of the child are among the factors taken into account in determining if the legislative provision relating to abandonment and failure to provide is satisfied.</P>
        <P>Where a child whose parent/s have been incarcerated is cared for by another person for the period of that incarceration and their carer is in receipt of a social welfare payment (other than a Guardian&rsquo;s payment), an increase for a qualified child may be payable for each child.</P>
        <P>In light of the above, I do not propose to amend the current definition of an orphan.</P>

	<P>The Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can be accommodated within the social welfare pensions system, with due regard being paid to the contributory principle underlying entitlement to contributory payments and, in the case of non-contributory payments, the need to ensure that resources are directed to those who are most in need.  Over the last 10 years, means tests have been improved and qualifying conditions for contributory payments made easier. </P>
        <P>Many women, in both the private and the public sector, left employment on marriage because they were required to or because that was the societal norm at the time.  Civil servants who left the workforce through the operation of the marriage bar were not insured for social welfare pension purposes.  Accordingly, the loss of pension rights in their case relates more to their occupational position rather than social welfare pension entitlements.</P>
        <P>That said, the Green Paper on Pensions, includes a full discussion on the social welfare pension position of women who had to resign due to the marriage bar.  Decisions in relation to those who are not at present receiving support through the social welfare system, including those who had to leave employment on marriage, will be considered in that context.  It is expected that the policy framework will be finalised by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>The legislative provisions relating to late claims for social welfare payments, including carer&rsquo;s benefit, are set out in Section 241 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and in Regulations made under that section. These provisions set out the times within which a person must claim, the disqualifications which apply where a late claim is made and the circumstances in which the time limits may be extended. </P>
        <P>The legislation provides for payment to be made on foot of late claims in the case of a range of schemes for a period of 6 months prior to the date of claim provided there was good cause for the late claim which can be due to:</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />incorrect information having been given by the Department, or</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />illness or a force majeure prevented a person from claiming earlier or,</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the person is dependent on the arrears of payment to relieve financial hardship.</P>
       <P FLI="0" el="5">An application for carer&rsquo;s benefit should be made eight weeks before the claimant intends to leave employment in order that his/her eligibility can be assessed prior to leaving employment. A late claim will be accepted for up to eight weeks after caring has commenced where an emergency caring situation has arisen and the claimant had to take up caring duties immediately. A claim later than eight weeks may be accepted at the discretion of the Deciding Officer where s/he considers there was good cause throughout the period of delay, but payment cannot be made in respect of a period more than 6 months prior to the date of claim.</P>
        <P>It is generally accepted that there is an obligation on people to claim their social welfare entitlements in time. However, cases will inevitably arise where they fail to do so and the <Col N="406"/>legislative provisions are designed to cater for such situations. I am satisfied that the current provisions strike a reasonable balance between, on the one hand, the need to exercise supervision and control of claims and, on the other hand, the need for appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty.</P>
        <P>With regard to the person to whom the Deputy refers, I have asked that the details of the particular case be re-examined and I will revert to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Up until recently people signing for a jobseekers payment were offered a choice of payment method. They could collect it at a post office of their choice or have it paid directly to their bank or building society account. </P>
        <P>Late last year there were indications that a number of foreign jobseekers had returned to their own country but were continuing to have their payment made by Electronic Funds Transfer to their bank account. Officials in the Department carried out an investigation of non-Irish national jobseekers and found that a significant number of them were no longer living at their stated address or were claiming a level of benefit to which they were not entitled. This is clearly an abuse of our welfare system and threatens the public finances at a time when all budgets are under pressure.</P>
        <P>The Department therefore decided that from 7 July 2008, all new jobseekers must be paid at a post office. Each weekly payment at a post office is available only for a limited period and if not collected within a matter of a few days it reverts to the Department. In such situation, the person is required to attend at the local social welfare office to have payment reinstated.</P>
        <P>The measures that have been put in place to restrict the availability of payment directly to a bank account virtually eliminates the possibility of a person being absent from the country while claiming a jobseekers payment and should have the effect of minimising the risk of abuse of the system and overpayment of benefits.</P>
        <P>Officials in the Department will be intensifying their control activities over the coming months in order to ensure that only those who have an entitlement are paid the appropriate amount. They will monitor residency for both non-Irish nationals and Irish people who are signing on through regular home visits by Inspectors. They will also be monitoring people who having been receiving payment to a bank account prior to the introduction of these new arrangements, to ensure that they continue to satisfy the conditions for payment.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system is based on two quite different types of entitlement &mdash; a social insurance system for people who have paid sufficient PRSI contributions and a social assistance <Col N="407"/>system for people without adequate contributions who have little or no household means of their own.</P>
        <P>Social insurance is intended both to enable people to insure themselves against adverse life events such as illness or unemployment and to provide for their state pensions and other benefits, through contributions to the national Social Insurance Fund. Social insurance benefits are not means-tested. Instead, entitlement depends on having paid the required number of PRSI contributions relevant to the particular benefit you wish to claim.</P>
        <P>For the past eleven years, the Social Insurance Fund has been in surplus, with more than sufficient income to the fund to cover the payments being made from it each year, without the State having to provide a subsidy. However, that is changing. As a result of further increases in the live register, expenditure is expected to exceed income to the Fund by over &euro;200 million this year and about &euro;900 million next year. Although these current deficits can be met from the accumulated surplus, it looks likely that the Exchequer may yet again have to subsidize expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund within a few years.</P>
        <P>In that context, it is appropriate to look at some of the instances where people with a very limited or distant contribution record have been able to qualify for very significant benefits, regardless of their household income.</P>
        <P>Currently, people who have paid just 52 contributions in total can qualify for jobseekers benefit, illness benefit and health and safety benefit.  This means, for example, that migrants or young workers who have only worked here for a total of one year are entitled to claim jobseekers payments for 12 months, without having to satisfy a means test. This will change from next January, when the number of required paid contributions will be doubled to 104 for new claimants.</P>
        <P>A further anomaly that exists at present is that some people, who were previously working part-time, can receive a higher rate of payment from these schemes than what they were actually earning whilst at work. Again, this is considered to be inappropriate &mdash; a disincentive to employment &mdash; and so, and from next January, this situation will be addressed by increasing the earnings thresholds which currently apply to the reduced or graduated rates of payment from &euro;150 to &euro;300 per week.</P>
        <P>At present, it is necessary to have made 13 paid contributions in the relevant tax year in order to qualify for illness benefit. However, this condition does not exist for jobseekers benefit, with the result that people who may not have paid PRSI contributions in the past number of years can qualify. Again, it is considered that this position does not adequately reflect the contribution-based rationale for social insurance and so from next January, new claimants for jobseekers benefit will be required to satisfy the same conditions as those on illness benefit and must have paid 13 contributions in the relevant tax year.</P>
        <P>The other two changes being made to jobseekers benefit relate to the duration of the payment. At present, people who have 260 or more paid social insurance contributions can receive jobseekers benefit for up to 15 months. As of today, this is being limited to 12 months for current claimants with less than six months duration on the scheme as well as all new claimants. Where the claimant has less than 260 paid contributions, the maximum duration of jobseekers benefit will be 9 months (instead of 12 months) if the claimant currently has been in receipt of benefit for less than three months and in respect of all new claimants.</P>
        <P>In summary, new claimants for jobseekers benefit will in future have to have paid a total of at least 104 contributions to the Social Insurance Fund, with at least 13 of these paid in the relevant tax year. The rate of payment will more closely reflect what the individual was earning <Col N="408"/>prior to becoming unemployed and the duration of the payment will be either 12 or 9 months depending on the number of social insurance contributions they have made in the past.</P>
        <P>Taken together, these changes to jobseekers, illness and health &amp; safety benefits are expected to generate &euro;72.7 million in savings next year and &euro;119 million a year from 2010 on.</P>
        <P>I would like to stress that people who will be affected by these changes will be able to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or supplementary welfare allowance instead, if they have limited means. The maximum rate of these two schemes is paid at the same rate as jobseekers benefit.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159, 174 and 180 together.     </P>
        <P>Supplementary pension coverage for workers in general was 54% in the first quarter of 2008. Coverage for the key target group, those aged 30 years and over stood at 61%.</P>
        <P>The National Pensions Awareness Campaign has been run by the Pensions Board on behalf of the Department annually since 2003. In the current year a total of &euro;1million has been provided to support the campaign.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that exploring ways in which supplementary pension cover could be improved was a major focus of the Government&rsquo;s Green Paper on Pensions. Following the launch of the Green paper we embarked on an extended consultation process which closed at the end of May.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Overall the process was very successful with a wide range of submissions received from both representative organisations and members of the public.  All the submissions are available at<i> www.pensionsgreenpaper.ie</i> and the Department has just published a report which summarises the views expressed through the consultation process.</P>
        <P>The Department has met with a number of organisations to explore their submissions in more detail.  Unfortunately, while everyone acknowledges the need for pension reform, no consensus has emerged from the consultation process on the nature of the reforms required.  				</P>
        <P>Our objective is to ensure that we have in place a pensions system which will deliver an adequate retirement income to all our people and which can, at the same time, withstand the cost pressures which will arise in the future as the composition of our population changes and the balance between those at work and those who are retired shifts dramatically.</P>
        <P>In deciding on reforms, we must be aware that good pension provision entails significant costs for society as a whole, whether it is delivered through the State system or by personal contributions to private arrangements.   There is no doubt that the Government is faced with difficult decisions. Discussions on possible approaches are ongoing with my Government colleagues.</P><Col N="409"/>
        <P>I and the Government intend bringing this process to a conclusion by the end of the year by announcing a framework to address the pensions agenda for the longer-term. The nature of the reform decided on will dictate the period over which it will be implemented.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Combating poverty and building an inclusive society are key priorities for the Government. The overall goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) introduced in February 2007 is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2 % and 4 % by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. These commitments and the social inclusion commitments in the National Development Plan have wide-ranging support, having been drawn up in consultation with the social partners and other stakeholders. </P>
        <P>One of the twelve high level goals, set out in the Plan, focuses on achieving significant real increases in income supports for children; three others address education initiatives. In addition, 42 of the 150 detailed targets in the Plan cover services such as health, education, income support and early childhood development and care to tackle poverty in families and ensure that children reach their true potential.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been achieved in reducing child poverty in Ireland over the past decade and the Government is determined to continue this work, in spite of current economic difficulties. Last week&rsquo;s Budget provided for a range of measures costing over &euro;56 million to benefit children and families. These measures include, an increase of &euro;2 in the qualified child increase payable with social welfare payments bringing the rate up to &euro;26 per week from January 2009; an increase of &euro;10 per week per child in all Family Income Supplement income thresholds giving an increase of up to &euro;6 per child per week, from January 2009; and an increase of &euro;50 per week in the income threshold for the back to school clothing and footwear scheme to enable more families to qualify. These increases will mean that the high level goal of maintaining the combined value of child income support measures at 33% to 35% of the minimum adult social welfare payment rate will continue to be met next year (ranging between 42 and 46%).</P>
        <P>In framing Budget 2009, the Government has prioritised delivering real increases in social welfare payments to ensure that, in line with the NAPinclusion, the most vulnerable groups in our society are protected. Increases of between 3 % and 3.8 % in the basic payment rates have been provided for next year, ahead of the projected rate of inflation for 2009, which is 2.5%.</P>

	<P>The social welfare related measures in Budget 2009 were subjected to a Poverty Impact Assessment in accordance with guidelines issued by the Office for Social Inclusion in March of this year. </P><Col N="410"/>
        <P>Poverty Impact Assessment is the process by which government departments, local authorities and State Agencies assess policies and programmes at design, implementation and review stages in relation to the likely impact that they will have, or have had, on poverty and on inequalities which are likely to lead to poverty, with a view to poverty reduction.</P>
        <P>The ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH model was used to measure the impact of the proposed changes on actual household incomes. This analysis concluded the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The increase is progressive in terms of its distributional impact: 52% of the change in disposable income resulting from the social welfare Budget proposals will go to those in the bottom three deciles, while 79% will go to the bottom half of the income distribution; and</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The proposals will result in a fall of 0.59 and 1.20 percentage points respectively in the numbers below 50% and 60% of median equivalised disposable income.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">Actual changes in both the &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; and &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo; rates during 2009 will not be known until the results of the EU-SILC survey for that year are available, which is likely to be in November 2010 approximately.</P>
        <P>A separate Poverty Impact Assessment on the taxation proposals in the Budget was undertaken by the Department of Finance.</P>

        <Quest> her views on a review of the way in which the governing contribution year applies, particularly with regard to C2 workers, many of whom were forced into becoming C2 certificate holders and who now face unemployment without access to social welfare payments. </Quest>

	<P>The Pay-Related Social Insurance (PRSI) system is based on both the &ldquo;contributory&rdquo; and &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo; principles. The former principle provides that there is a direct link between the amount of contributions that a person pays into the system and their subsequent entitlement to a varying range of benefits that are payable if and when particular contingencies arise.</P>
        <P>The &lsquo;governing contribution year&rsquo; criteria applying to various benefit schemes act as an administrative expression of this principle. As such the criteria provide a mechanism whereby entitlement to a benefit is determined, inter alia, by reference to a particular recent contribution year.  At present, this is the 2006 tax year. Any move to extend the criteria to cover a greater number of years would necessarily dilute the contributory principle on which the PRSI system is based.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers, including C2 certificate holders, aged between 16 and 66 years and with reckonable income that exceeds the current insurable limit of &euro;3,174 per annum pay social insurance contributions at PRSI Class S. These contributions are due at 3% of reckonable income, or &euro;253, whichever is the greater.</P>
        <P>PRSI Class S contributors are entitled to the following payments:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Widow&rsquo;s or Widower&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Guardian&rsquo;s Payment (Contributory); </P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the State Pension (Contributory);</P><Col N="411"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Maternity Benefit;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Adoptive Benefit, and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Bereavement Grant.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work. This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable. Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s payments &mdash; these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</P>
        <P>There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.</P>
        <P>Class S contributors who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments by satisfying certain conditions &mdash; including a means test.</P>

	<P>Since the beginning of this year, there has been a significant increase in the number of people on the Live Register. In response to this, the Department has taken a number of measures to minimise delays in the processing of claims for jobseeker payments. These measures include the allocation of additional posts to local offices, extending the contracts of some temporary staff and providing additional overtime. These measures are kept under review. </P>
        <P>I am very conscious of the social and economic impact of rising unemployment and I assure you that the Government is absolutely determined to assist the unemployed. The main welfare to work measure is the National Employment Action Plan. Currently, every person between the ages of 18 and 65 years who is approaching 3 months on the Live Register is referred to F&Aacute;S for interview with a view to assisting them enter or re-enter the labour market. Just over 30,000 people were referred to F&Aacute;S under the NEAP in the first six months of 2008. Of these 13,350 (44%) have left the Live Register.</P>
        <P>A number of control initiatives have also been introduced to respond to the growing numbers on the Live Register. The EFT payment method will not be available to new claimants for unemployment payments. This means that they will have to attend at the post office weekly to <Col N="412"/>collect their payment thereby eliminating the risk of people working abroad and returning monthly to sign on.  In addition the activities of the Special Investigation Units (SIU) in the Department are being refocused to put an increased emphasis on the Live Register. This involves undertaking more regular interviewing of recipients of job seeker payments with particular emphasis on high risk categories.</P>
        <P>Provision has been made in the National Development Plan, under the Social and Economic Participation Programme, for an Activation Programme over the lifetime of the Plan. The programme is aimed at all people of working age regardless of the circumstances that led the person to require income maintenance with some &euro;50m. being invested in this area.</P>
        <P>The main element of the Activation sub-programme is to expand the Department&rsquo;s facilitator service, to cover all parts of the State and with each facilitator having a defined work programme. Facilitators provide additional, more intensive assistance, for those who need it including people who have been identified by F&Aacute;S as needing further support. The facilitator programme is designed to be a targeted approach, involving active case management and the development of an individualised personal progression plan. The facilitator and individual will work together to identify the most appropriate method of progressing to training or employment. As part of the priority now placed on activation, the Department&rsquo;s facilitators are working closely with F&Aacute;S and other agencies at national and local level.</P>
        <P>A particular priority is being placed on younger people signing on for the first time and people who have completed the Employment Action Plan process but who are still on the Live Register.</P>
        <P>Over the summer months the Department conducted a targeted programme to encourage young people between 18 and 25 years of age who were signing on the Live Register for more that six months to gain additional skills and qualifications under the back to education scheme.</P>
        <P>In response to the downturn in the construction industry sector and in recognition of the special difficulties faced by apprentices who are being laid off, the Department and F&Aacute;S are working together to facilitate such apprentices in finishing their apprenticeships and in obtaining necessary certification thereby enhancing employment prospects at home and abroad. In such cases, referral is made immediately to F&Aacute;S. F&Aacute;S have details of a number of employers seeking apprentices and will attempt to place apprentices with such employers where possible.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Government has prioritised social welfare in the Budget, ensuring that increases in the basic rates of social welfare payments will be ahead of the projected rate of inflation and in line with the wage increases agreed by the social partners in the 2nd phase of the National Pay Agreement. In addition, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and F&Aacute;S the National Training and Employment Authority will continue to work closely together to address the needs of those on the Live Register and to assist them in</P>

	<P>The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) undertook an audit of the Department in late January 2008. <Col N="413"/>The audit focused on the measures in place to protect the security of personal data of customers and the extent of data-sharing in the broader public service using the Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) as an identifier. </P>
        <P>The Report, which was received in the Department in June 2008, lists a series of recommendations covering access management, security, data-sharing and data protection policies. The Report was published on the Department&rsquo;s website in July 2008, alongside the Data Protection Policy and Guidelines.</P>
        <P>The Department holds extensive personal information about its customers in order to conduct its day-to-day business, pay entitlements and provide a range of services over people&rsquo;s lifespan. We take our responsibilities to protect this information very seriously and, for sometime, we have been engaged in a broad programme of work to enhance the effectiveness of the information security controls. The Department welcomes the contribution of the Commissioner&rsquo;s Report to enhancing the effectiveness of its information security programme.</P>
        <P>The Data Protection Commissioner, while recognising the specific challenges for an organisation as large and diverse as this Department, highlighted areas of concern and areas in need of strengthening. In response, the Department has implemented some improvements and others have been incorporated into our wider information security programme.</P>
        <P>Policies and procedures governing the use of information systems and data are constantly under review. Recently a number of new policies have been developed and issued to staff in covering data transfers and the use of mobile computing and storage devices. Staff are regularly reminded of their obligations under data protection and security policies and of the penalties applicable in respect of any breach of these policies.</P>
        <P>In addition to the policy measures, the Department is also ensuring that higher levels of data protection are built into its latest generation of ICT systems to reflect the increased threats in this area. Considerable resources have also been devoted to increasing the security and monitoring facilities in its older systems.</P>
        <P>The Department has committed itself to informing the Commissioner of progress on the issues highlighted in his recommendations by the end of 2008.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 and 181 together.</P>
        <P>Among the main objectives of the Department&rsquo;s policies on child income support is the alleviation of poverty in families with children and the facilitation and encouragement of employment by parents, as it is recognised that employment by a parent is the best route out of poverty.  The main policy instruments for child income support are child benefit, increases in weekly social welfare payments for qualified children (IQCs), family income supplement (FIS) and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.</P><Col N="414"/>
        <P>Significant progress has been achieved over the past decade in reducing poverty among children.  The Government is determined to continue this work, as evidenced in last week&rsquo;s Budget which provided for a range of measures costing over &euro;56 million to benefit children and families.  These measures include an increase of &euro;2 in the IQCs, bringing them up to &euro;26 per week from January 2009; all FIS income thresholds to increase by &euro;10 per week per child, giving an increase of up to &euro;6 per week per child from January 2009; and the income threshold for the back to school clothing and footwear scheme to increase by &euro;50 per week from &euro;100 to &euro;150 to allow more families to qualify.  At a time when it is essential that public expenditure be strictly controlled in the national interest, this increased provision for children and families is an unambiguous statement of the Government&rsquo;s intent to protect the vulnerable and less well-off in society.</P>
        <P>A consistent finding in recent studies on poverty and social inclusion in Ireland is that larger families face a higher risk of poverty.  In order to address this problem a number of the child income support payments provide higher support to larger families.  For instance, child benefit is structured so as to target additional resources at larger families by providing a higher rate of child benefit for the third and subsequent qualified children.  The FIS income thresholds were refocused in 2006 and 2007 to concentrate additional resources on larger families, with increases ranging from &euro;9 for a one child family to &euro;111 for a family with 8 or more children provided in 2007.</P>
        <P>Age differentiated support is provided through the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the early childcare supplement.  For instance, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is a targeted payment designed to help people on low incomes with the cost of children&rsquo;s school clothing and footwear.  In recognition of the higher clothing costs incurred by older children, this allowance is paid at a higher rate (&euro;305) for children between 12 and 22 years.  An early childcare supplement of &euro;1,100 a year is also paid to help parents of young children to meet their childcare needs.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above mentioned supports, most weekly social welfare payments include an increase for qualified children in respect of each qualified child up to age 18, and in certain circumstances, for children up to 22 years who are school/college going.  However, it is recognised that the loss of the IQC by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities.  As a consequence, the policy direction followed by successive Governments in recent years has focused on the objective of reforming income support for children in order to reduce work disincentives by making child income support more neutral vis-&agrave;-vis the employment status of the parent.  In this regard, child benefit rates have been increased substantially as a result of this policy focus with a view to facilitating a greater level of choice with regard to economic participation, particularly by women, with female participation rates in the workforce having increases significantly.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, the introduction of the national minimum wage, together with the improvements in the FIS scheme in recent years, including the re-focusing of the FIS income thresholds on larger families, have further reduced the impact of the loss of IQCs in the decision to take up full-time employment.  In view of these changed circumstances, the three separate rates of IQC payment which applied up to 2006 were consolidated into a single higher rate of payment.  This payment will be increased further from &euro;24 to &euro;26 a week from January, 2009.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided that Child Benefit will no longer be paid in respect of those who are 18 years old. At that stage, they are effectively treated as adults in most respects.  This change will be phased in gradually.  A half payment will be made in respect of existing and <Col N="415"/>future qualifying children from January 2009 and from January 2010 the payment will cease from the 18 birthday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Special alleviating measures are being introduced for social welfare dependent families.  A special increase of &euro;15 per week will be paid with qualified child increases payment for those aged 18.  It is expected that some 10,000 families will benefit from this measure.  In addition, the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance will be increased by &euro;215 to &euro;520 per annum for eligible 18 year olds and recipients of Family Income Supplement will receive additional payments of up to &euro;15 per week for each dependent aged 18 where they are not otherwise being compensated.</P>
        <P>Further improvements in level and structure of the child income support will be considered in the light of available resources and having regard to other priorities.</P>

	<P>The average contributions test has been a key qualifying condition for contributory pensions since the scheme was introduced in 1961. With a few exceptions, a person&rsquo;s contribution record is generally averaged from the first day they enter social insurance until they reach retirement age. A contributory pension is a very valuable benefit and the objective of the average contributions test is to ensure, amongst other things, that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the social insurance fund over the course of their working lives. </P>
        <P>The operation of the average contributions test is discussed in the Pensions Green Paper and it was also raised by many people in the associated consultation process. A number of groups, including older women returning to employment after many years caring for family and people returning from abroad, have complained about the impact a large gap in their insurance record can have on their pension entitlements.</P>
        <P>The Green Paper consultation process concluded at the end of May and work has commenced on developing a framework for future pensions policy which the Government has indicated will be announced by the end of the year. Changes to the average contribution test will be considered in that context.</P>

	<P>The household benefits package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test. It is also available to people aged under 66 who are in receipt of certain disability social welfare payments or carer&rsquo;s allowance. <Col N="416"/>The package includes the electricity and gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes. </P>
        <P>Some 358,000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity and gas allowances through the household benefits package. These allowances help with heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year. The electricity allowance element of the household benefits package is paid as a credit on the person&rsquo;s electricity bill. The natural gas allowance is an alternative to the electricity allowance for people whose homes are connected to a natural gas supply. People can choose to have the allowance applied to either their electricity or their gas bill, whichever is most beneficial to them.</P>
        <P>In recent years there have been significant improvements to the value of these allowances. In January 2007 the number of units covered by the electricity allowance was increased from 1,200 to 2,400 units. A corresponding increase in the value of the gas allowance had been implemented in the previous October.</P>
        <P>From 1 August 2008 the value of the electricity allowance per household increased from &euro;465 to &euro;540 per annum in line with electricity price increases, based on urban rates. In order to continue to maintain the value of the electricity and gas allowances at the same level, the value of the gas allowance was also increased to &euro;540 per annum from the same date. I increased the value of the allowances in order to match recent price increases to ensure that customers continue to receive the same amount of energy under the household benefit scheme.</P>
        <P>This represents increased expenditure on these schemes of some &euro;11 million for the remainder of the year bringing the total expenditure on the schemes to approximately &euro;170 million this year.</P>
        <P>The national fuel allowance scheme also provides assistance to householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2009 I was pleased to be able to increase the value of the fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week to &euro;20 per week from January 2009 with an additional &euro;3.90 per week paid to those in smokeless fuel areas. In addition, I was happy to extend the duration of the scheme by two weeks so that the fuel allowance will now be paid for 32 weeks a year.</P>
        <P>Fuel allowances are incorporated in the recipient&rsquo;s weekly social welfare payment. This reflects the objective that the total weekly income of benefit and assistance recipients, including the fuel allowance, is sufficient to meet all of their income needs, including heating costs.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that almost 300,000 people will benefit under the scheme in 2008 at a cost over &euro;170 million.</P>
        <P>As with all schemes, I will be keeping the household benefits and fuel allowance schemes under review to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178, 415, 417 and 418 together.</P>
        <P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>Carer&rsquo;s allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means tested.  This ensures scarce resources are directed at those in greatest need.  The primary objective of the carer&rsquo;s allowance is to provide income support to low income carers.  The carer&rsquo;s allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes.  It has been significantly eased over the years, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.</P>
        <P>In April 2008 the level of the carer&rsquo;s allowance income disregard was increased from &euro;320 to &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and from &euro;640 to &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This ensures that a couple can have an income in the region of &euro;37,200 per year and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package and the respite care grant.  This increase surpasses the &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; commitment to ensuring that those on average earnings can qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2009 I increased the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for those aged 66 or over by &euro;7 per week to &euro;239 per week and the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for those aged under 66 by &euro;6.50 from &euro;214 to &euro;220.50 per week.  In addition, I increased the rate of carer&rsquo;s benefit by &euro;6.50 from &euro;214.70 to &euro;221.20 per week.  These increases will take effect from January 2009.</P>
        <P>Budget 2007 provided for new arrangements whereby people can receive a maximum payment of equivalent to a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance while receiving another social welfare payment other than jobseekers benefit or allowance.  These new arrangements came into effect in September 2007 and to date over 14,200 carers have benefited.</P>
        <P>In June 2006 the number of hours for which a person can engage in employment, self-employment, education or training and still be considered to be providing full time care for the purposes of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.</P><Col N="418"/>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  A carer who is caring for two or more people is entitled to a full grant for each of the care recipients.  In June 2008 the level of the grant increased to &euro;1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient.</P>

	<P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension.  People from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, resident in the State, who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel. </P>
        <P>The free travel companion pass entitles the pass holder to have any one person, aged 16 years or over, to accompany him/her free of charge when travelling.  Such companion passes are available to persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone.</P>
        <P>The main objective of the free travel scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active in the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care.  The purpose of allowing pass holders to be accompanied while travelling is to facilitate further this mobility.</P>
        <P>The extension of the scheme to allow the pass holder&rsquo;s companion to travel alone would not be in keeping with this objective.</P>

	<P>The EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is carried out annually by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). It is a survey of private households provided for under EU legislation (Council Regulation No 1177/2003) which commenced in Ireland in June 2003.  The primary focus of the survey is the collection of information on the income and living conditions of different types of households, from which indicators on poverty, deprivation and social exclusion are derived. </P>
        <P>The next EU-SILC report will relate to 2007 and is due to be published next month.  The report on 2008 is expected in approximately 12 months.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199 and 200 together.</P>
        <P>Data on invisible exports (services exports) is not readily available for the year 1997, but during the period 1998 to 2007 the value of these exports rose from &euro;8.859 billion in 1998 to &euro;65.65 billion in 2007, an increase of &euro;56.791 billion, representing a 641% rise during the period.</P>
        <P>Data on visible exports (merchandise exports) for the period 1997 to 2007 shows that the value of these exports also rose; from &euro;44.868 billion in 1997 to &euro;89.078 billion in 2007, an increase of &euro;44.21 billion or 99%.</P>
        <P>Details of the year-on-year movements for both these export categories are shown on the following table.  The data shows that, with the exception of the figures for merchandise exports for 2003, which reflect the global economic slowdown that occurred around that time, the value of exports increased year-on-year for the periods in question.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has primary responsibility for the procurement of suitable accommodation for both the advance and permanent re-location of decentralising Departments, including my Department&rsquo;s staff to Carlow. </P>
        <P>Officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30 2007.  It is my understanding from the OPW that the yearly rental costs for this office is in the region of &euro;369,000 and the fit-out costs were approximately &euro;2,068,000.</P>
        <P>With regard to the property costs for the Department&rsquo;s permanent move to Carlow, the OPW completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre for the construction of my Department&rsquo;s permanent office and I understand from the OPW that the site acquisition costs were &euro;1,440,000.</P>
        <P>With regard to non-property decentralisation costs incurred to date, the most recent figures for such costs for my Department, as submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, via the Department of Finance, relates to the period January 2004 to June 2008.

	<P>My Department has been making good progress in the relocation of the required 250 posts to Carlow under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme.  The following business units/Offices of my Department are earmarked for decentralisation:</P>

     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Insolvency Payments Section</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30 <Col N="426"/>2007.  This office is situated on O&rsquo;Brien Road and is currently being leased by the OPW on behalf of the Department.</P>
        <P>The number of staff in this decentralised advance office is 100.  As well as staff already decentralised, there are 48 staff within my Department due to decentralise when the substantive move takes place, with a further 47 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned from other Departments.</P>
        <P>With regard to the property side of the Department&rsquo;s move, the OPW completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre for the construction of my Department&rsquo;s permanent office in Carlow.  My colleague Minister of State Noel Ahern TD, announced on 13 December 2007 that the OPW has invited The Macquarie Partnership as the consortium to become the &lsquo;Successful Tenderer&rsquo; in respect of this decentralisation project.  This forms part of a major PPP project, which also involves the provision of office accommodation for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Portlaoise and the Department of Education and Science in Mullingar.</P>
        <P>The formal application for planning permission was lodged with Carlow Town Council on 18 April 2008 and planning permission, with conditions, was granted on 12 June 2008 subject to appeal.  The Office of Public Works has since advised that two objections lodged against the planning permission have been referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la website indicates that the appeal cases are due to be decided by 10 November 2008.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 and 204 together.</P>
        <P>In April 2005, the option of cost neutral early superannuation benefits was made available to serving staff who met the eligibility criteria and those who had resigned on or after 1 April 2004, with an entitlement to preserved superannuation benefits at the time of their resignation.  There were no early retirements in 2004</P>
        <P>In 2005 there were five retirements under the Cost Neutral Early Retirement Scheme from my Department.  The total amount of annual pensions in respect of the five individuals is &euro;82,965.83.  Of the five only three have been replaced at an annual cost of &euro;125,325.  These costs have increased in subsequent years in line with National pay agreements.</P>
        <P>In 2006, two staff members availed of Cost Neutral Early Retirement.  The amount of annual pensions in respect of the two individuals was &euro;44,895.22.  Only one post was filled at an annual salary of &euro;80,408.  These costs have increased in subsequent years in line with National pay agreements</P>
        <P>In 2007, one staff member availed of Cost Neutral Early Retirement, with an annual pension of &euro;11,929.76, which will increase in line with National pay agreements.  This person was not replaced.</P><Col N="427"/>
        <P>In 2008, five staff members availed of Cost Neutral Early Retirement, with annual pensions amounting to &euro;142,525.88.  Only one of the five was replaced at an annual salary of &euro;86,168.  These costs will increase in line with future National pay agreements.</P>

        <Quest> the measures or policies that have been implemented to prevent loss of private data from laptops, blackberries and other hand-held devices in her Department; if she is satisfied that all personal information held within her Department is secure; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>My Department is very conscious of its obligations under the Data Protection Acts, and adopts a proactive approach to ensuring that personal data stored by it is kept secure.  Physical safeguards, a secure ICT infrastructure and staff awareness programmes all play a role in supporting data protection in my Department.  Regarding ICT this is a continuous process, involving a combination of appropriately skilled people and the implementation of best-practice processes and technologies.  Last year, my Department with the assistance of external ICT security experts, conducted a comprehensive review of ICT security across the Department and its Offices.  The findings of the report now form a significant part of my Department&rsquo;s new ICT Strategy (2008-2010) and a programme of work is currently being undertaken which is designed to deliver ongoing improvements in the security of the Department&rsquo;s ICT systems, thereby minimizing the risk of compromising data and/or security breaches. </P>
        <P>In relation to laptops, a project is well under way within my Department to apply whole disk encryption to all laptops.  The majority of existing laptops have already been encrypted and the target is to have all remaining laptops encrypted by year-end.  All new laptops are being encrypted before they are issued to officers.  In addition encrypted USB flash drives are provided to officers who have a requirement to carry personal data on such devices and my Department is hoping to introduce centralised USB port control on PCs and laptops in 2009.</P>
        <P>Many officers within my Department use Blackberry devices for access to email while out of the office.  My Department is applying centralised security policies to such devices, including password enforcement and the remote erasure of all data from the BlackBerry in the event that it is reported missing.</P>
        <P>A key component of information security is user awareness and so a security and data protection awareness programme is currently underway in my Department.  All induction courses for new staff members include segments on information security and data protection.  In September 2007 all staff in my Department were issued with a Human Resources Management Handbook in hard copy format, which includes a dedicated section concerning the provisions of data protection legislation, and highlighting the obligations and responsibilities for staff in this area.  These obligations were reiterated to all staff by way of an Office Notice in November 2007.</P>
        <P>A programme of data protection and security awareness workshops is also under way. The workshops are facilitated by experts in the field who, prior to the workshop, examine the business units involved in terms of information security and data protection.</P>

	<P>A student on a &ldquo;stamp 2&rdquo; is permitted to remain by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in Ireland to pursue a course of studies and is permitted to engage in casual employment which is defined as not more that 20 hours per week during term, and up to 40 hours per week during holidays.  A student on a Stamp 2 is prohibited from engaging in full time employment and cannot be issued with an employment permit.</P>
        <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform determines the immigration status of persons within the State and whether they can remain in the State.  Students on a Stamp 2 should be present in the State to pursue a course of studies and are not here for the purpose of entering employment.  Accordingly this Department is not in a position to consider employment permit applications from persons present in the State on a student status apart from applications received under the &ldquo;Third Level Graduate Scheme&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>A non-EEA student who has, on or after 1 January, 2007, acquired a Primary Degree, an Honours Degree, a Higher Diploma, a Masters Degree, a Post-Graduate Diploma or a Doctorate Degree from an Irish third level educational institution is eligible to apply under the Scheme.</P>

	<P>My Department monitors sickness absence in order to ensure the proper application of the sick leave regulations.  Sickness absence for this purpose is measured in &ldquo;duration days&rdquo; (span of sickness absence from date of first absence to date of return to work) rather than actual working days lost.</P>
        <P>Separately, my Department has begun detailed examination of sickness absence, applying international best practice principles.  Our first such examination was done in respect of the calendar year 2007.  According to this analysis, the percentage of working days lost in 2007 was 3.90%.</P>
        <P>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, we have reviewed the data for the years 2003 &mdash; 2006 inclusive.  My Department has been able to ascertain that the equivalent figure for 2006 was 4.02%.  Extracting similar information for the years 2003 to 2005 inclusive would be an extremely complex and time consuming process and would have to be done manually.</P>

	<P>I understand from Enterprise Ireland that on 17 May 1998, the agency approved assistance to <Col N="430"/>the company under its Research Technology &amp; Innovation (RTI) Competitive Grants Initiative.  The company drew down moneys over a four year period as outlined in the following table.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the RTI Initiative was to bring about a substantial increase in the level of high quality research and development in businesses in Ireland.  The RTI Initiative supported commercially focused, industry led projects in product and process development and covered high quality, risk intensive R&amp;D projects.</P>
        <P>In the reply to Parliamentary Question No, 254 of 13 February, 2008, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said that payment and repayment of grants are day-to-day operational matters for the Industrial Development agencies and he did not have any role in these matters.  The date and purpose of funds are also day-to-day operational matters.  Further information in relation to such matters can be obtained by the Deputy directly from the appropriate Industrial Development agency which is Enterprise Ireland in this case.</P>

	<P>Much of the capital expenditure from my Department&rsquo;s vote is IT related rather than geographically specific and accordingly it is not possible to account for all capital expenditure from my Department&rsquo;s vote on a county by county basis.  Such expenditure includes e-procurement development, grants under the information society fund, capital grants in aid to the Institute of Public Administration and the Economic and Social research institute.</P>
        <P>Capital grants in aid were made from my Department&rsquo;s vote to Ordnance Survey Ireland of &euro;1.978m in 2002, &euro;1.399m in 2003, &euro;1.8m in 2005 and &euro;1m in 2006.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The State plays a major role in the housing sector and as I stated in my Budget Speech last week, the Government has invested significantly in housing in recent years.  This includes the direct investment by the Exchequer in a number of social and affordable housing schemes, augmented by funding raised by the Housing Finance Agency.  Supports are also provided through rent supplement payments and tax reliefs are available for interest paid on mortgages.</P><Col N="434"/>
        <P>There is a correction process under way in the housing market and the moderation in house prices is being driven by a range of factors, including wider economic uncertainty and higher interest rates.  In view of the changing conditions in the private housing market, my colleague Mr. Gormley, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I have agreed that there is merit in amending some existing housing policy.  Consequently, I announced last week an extension of the existing local authority mortgage scheme by increasing the maximum loan available to borrowers.  This extension will assist purchasers who wish to become homeowners but who are, at this time, unable to obtain loan finance.  This will be a targeted and temporary initiative to reflect current market conditions.  Funding will be provided by the Housing Finance Agency and it will be operated by a small number of local authorities acting on a regional basis.  The objective of the Scheme is to provide credit to prospective first time buyers, but it is not intended to stop the market correction taking place.</P>
        <P>Secondly, we have decided to introduce a single Government Equity Initiative to replace a range of existing schemes which have developed in recent years.  Under this Initiative the Government will assist those seeking affordable housing by taking an equity share in the property.  The purchaser will be able to buy out the Government equity share over a number of years or settle the equity share when the property is sold.</P>
        <P>Details of the Local Authority Mortgage Scheme were announced last week by Mr Finneran, Minster for Housing, Urban Renewal and Development Areas.  Details of the Government Equity Scheme will be announced in due course.</P>

        <Quest> the projected income from the banks as a result of the Government guarantee of &euro;400 billion; if the normal commercial rate for insuring debt of between 1% and 2% will apply; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008, approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 17th October 2008,  provides that a covered institution must pay a charge for its guarantee.  The aggregate charge for the participating institutions is set at a level that is based on the long-term cost to the Exchequer of providing the guarantee.  Current estimates indicate that over the two years of the Scheme around &euro;1 billion will be yielded from the charge to covered institutions for the guarantee.</P>
        <P>As I emphasised in the D&aacute;il during the debate on the Scheme on Friday 17th October, it is essential both that taxpayers are protected and that the guarantee charge is set at a level consistent with the long-term sustainability and commercial viability of our financial institutions.  I am confident that the Government&rsquo;s approach strikes the right balance between ensuring that the Exchequer is reimbursed in full for the cost of the scheme up-front and that the financial sector is safeguarded at a time of very substantial financial upheaval.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>For the purposes of giving some background on this to the Deputy I would like to point out that early in 2004, the Financial Regulator commenced a survey of institutions&rsquo; endowment mortgage business.  The Financial Regulator wrote to lenders and insurers seeking information on their endowment businesses.  The then Chief Executive of the Financial Regulator made a statement on the main findings of the survey to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 18 January 2006 highlighting that endowment mortgages represented a low percentage of mortgage loans outstanding.  He went on to say that endowment mortgage holders, who believed that they were mis-sold, or who felt that their issues were not properly dealt with, could in the first instance, contact their financial services provider and seek a formal response to their complaints and that if they were not satisfied with the explanation or response made by the financial service provider, the person could then refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) for consideration, in accordance with the procedure set out by the FSO.</P>
        <P>At the same Joint Oireachtas Committee meeting the Financial Services Ombudsman also made a statement on the matter in respect of complaints received by his office on endowment mortgages.  In that statement he confirmed that of the endowment cases referred to him, those that were upheld were done so on the grounds of maladministration rather than on the grounds of mis-selling.  Some of those cases were cases he had taken over from the previous voluntary ombudsman scheme.</P>
        <P>I do not therefore propose to establish a compensation scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 231 together.</P>
        <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a voluntary early retirement scheme.  No such scheme is available to staff in the Civil Service.  However, there are other arrangements which make provision for retirement earlier than normal pension age in certain circumstances.  Arrangements for cost-neutral early retirement were introduced in 2005 under Department of Finance Circular 10/2005 and are available in the Civil and Public Service generally.  In broad terms this facility, which was recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions, allows staff who are within ten years of their normal pension age to apply for early retirement with immediate payment of their superannuation benefits.</P><Col N="443"/>
        <P>The benefits are actuarially reduced to ensure that the early payment is cost-neutral to the Exchequer.  Retirement before normal pension age with immediate payment of superannuation benefits may be permitted on medical grounds.  Superannuation benefits may also be paid to a Civil Servant before normal pension age as a consequence of the abolition of his or her post or removal from office to facilitate improvements in the organisation of the Department by which greater efficiency and economy can be effected.</P>
        <P>The amount granted in pensions to staff retiring under the above arrangements in each of the past five years is set out in the following table.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In deciding whether a vacant post should be filled or suppressed, no distinction is generally made  between vacancies arising from normal retirement (i.e. other then under a specific retirement scheme) and those arising  from other causes.  Accordingly,  the remuneration of  staff subsequently appointed to such posts would not  be regarded as replacement cost.</P>

	<P>The breakdown of the overall savings target of &euro;440 million for 2008 and &euro;1 billion in 2009 was laid before the D&aacute;il on the 10th of July and these details are reproduced in the Appendix to this reply.</P>
        <P>Specific information on the achievement of these savings in 2008 will have to await the end of the year when provisional outturn figures will first become available.  Provisional outturn information at subhead level is normally published for the first time in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) for the following year.  However, on the basis of forecast outturns published in the 2009 Budget Volume, and taking into account specific offsetting expenditure pressures in some areas, I anticipate that the underlying savings targets as set out in the Appendix will be realised in full.</P>
        <P>Budget 2009 contains all relevant details on proposed expenditure and savings for 2009, 2010 and 2011.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 239 and 240 together.</P>
	<P Just="Left"> I assume the Deputy is referring to a voluntary early retirement scheme.  No such scheme is available to staff in the Civil Service.  However, there are other arrangements which make provision for retirement earlier than normal pension age in certain circumstances.  Arrangements for cost-neutral early retirement were introduced in 2005 under Department of Finance Circular 10/2005 and are available in the Civil and Public Service generally.  In broad terms this facility, which was recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions, allows staff who are within ten years of their normal pension age to apply for early retirement with immediate payment of their superannuation benefits.  The benefits are actuarially reduced to ensure that the early payment is cost-neutral to the Exchequer.  Retirement before normal pension age with immediate payment of superannuation benefits may be permitted on medical grounds.  Superannuation benefits may also be paid to a Civil Servant before normal pension age as a consequence of the abolition of his or her post or removal from office to facilitate improvements in the organisation of the Department by which greater efficiency and economy can be effected.</P>
        <P>The number of staff who retired under each of the above arrangements in each of the past three years is set out below. As the numbers involved are so small any further breakdown by age and grade as requested would not be appropriate.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to have Annex III of the EU VAT Directive amended to include road safety products and thereby reduce the rate of VAT applicable on such products; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the VAT Directive Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  While Annex III provides for the reduced rate of VAT to be applied to children&rsquo;s car seats, it does not provide for the reduced rate to be applied to road safety products in general, which are subject to the standard VAT rate of 21%.</P>
        <P>Regarding children&rsquo;s car safety seats, in Budget 2007 Ireland availed of the option under Annex III to apply the reduced rate of 13.5% to these products with effect from 1 July 2007.</P>
        <P>In relation to amending Annex III, the Deputy will be aware that this could only be done in the context of an overall review at Community level of reduced rates. In July 2008 the EU Commission published a proposal to amend the current Annex III, to expand the general possibility for Member States to apply reduced VAT rates on an optional basis to certain locally supplied services, including labour-intensive services, housing and restaurant services.  The Commission proposal does not, however, propose to include road safety equipment in general in Annex III.</P>

	<P>The Health Contribution was introduced by virtue of the Health Contributions Act 1979 and came into effect on the 6th April of that year. The contributions are levied on income at a percentage rate set in pursuance <Col N="452"/>of the Health Contributions Act and are paid over to the Minister for Health and Children in respect of the Vote for the Health Service Executive. The current rate of contribution is 2% of gross income up to &euro; 1,925 per week or &euro;100,100 per annum and 2.5 % on the balance of income in excess of those amounts in a contribution year. Subject to exemptions, the rate of contribution is applicable to all persons over the age of sixteen with reckonable income, earnings or emoluments.</P>
        <P>The exemptions, as outlined in Section 11 of the Act, are those whose income does not exceed &euro;26,000  per annum, those who are fully eligible for health services as set out in Section 45 of the Health Act 1970 (i.e. medical cardholders in this State, including those workers covered under EC Regulation 1408/71), recipients of a Social Welfare Widow&rsquo;s/Widower&rsquo;s Pension, One-parent Family Payment or Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit/Allowance, as well as those in receipt of a Widow&rsquo;/Widower&rsquo;s pension acquired under the social security legislation of an EU member State.</P>
        <P>As regards persons aged 70 or over, the current position is that those on receipt of a medical card are exempt from paying health contributions.  This will continue to be the case up to the end of this year.  I propose to amend the Health Contribution Act 1979, by bringing forward legislation in the upcoming Social Welfare Bill which will exempt all persons aged 70 years and over on or after the 1st January 2009 from the health contribution.</P>

	<P>My Department and the Health Service Executive published the National Pandemic Influenza Plan in 2007.  The purpose of the <Col N="457"/>plan is to limit the effects of a potential pandemic and to inform the public about pandemic influenza, explain what the Government and Health Services are doing to prepare for a possible pandemic, and give information on what members of the public need to do if there is a pandemic.  The plan will continue to be updated on a regular basis to reflect the most up to date advice of the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group and international developments.</P>
        <P>The health service response to the threat of an influenza pandemic is based on eight core elements: Communications Strategy, Telephone Hotline, Responsibilities of the Public, Surveillance, Antiviral Drugs, Pandemic Vaccine, Reorganisation of Health Services and Essential Supplies.</P>
        <P>In November 2007, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued its report into its inspection of Ireland&rsquo;s preparedness for a pandemic.  The ECDC report highlights areas where significant progress has been made and also points out where further work is needed.  The Report highlights the need to continue work on a whole of Government approach and detailed planning at local level.  This work continues to be a priority for my Department and for the HSE.</P>

	<P>Out of hours co-operatives allow general practitioners to put in place arrangements to provide services to their patients, while their surgeries are closed in the evenings, on weekends and bank holidays.  The development of GP co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, people&rsquo;s care needs are met in the primary care setting.</P>
        <P>Out of hours co-operatives are now in place in all Health Service Executive (HSE) areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties.  In 2007, the HSE Vote included almost &euro;37 million in baseline funding for these services and the Executive has advised that this figure is available again in 2008.  This figure does not include the fees of the participating doctors.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for this service, it is the appropriate body to provide the information sought by the Deputy.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 268 and 298 together.</P>
        <P>The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) is responsible for the implementation of CervicalCheck, the National Cervical Screening Programme.  Colposcopy services are an integral part of a population based screening programme.  Women who have pre-cancerous cell changes detected by their smear test are referred for colposcopy.  The NCSS is making a significant investment to enhance colposcopy services.  This will ensure timely access to a quality assured colposcopy service for women who require further investigation.</P>
        <P>It is important to ensure that as part of CervicalCheck, women can access colposcopy services within international best practice timeframes, based on adherence to quality assured clinical practice and the achievement of best clinical outcomes for women.</P>
        <P>The NCSS has identified eleven colposcopy services to support CervicalCheck initially.  The colposcopy service at Letterkenny General Hospital (LGH) has not been identified for initial referrals of women.  However, in the interim LGH will continue to provide colposcopy services to women already attending or awaiting colposcopy.</P>
        <P>The provision of additional colposcopy services to women in the North West is being examined.  The colposcopy service at LGH requires a number of enhancements to meet the quality assurance standards defined by the NCSS.  The NCSS is working with LGH and the question of the hospital&rsquo;s future participation in the colposcopy service for CervicalCheck will be considered in this context.  I understand that progress on the issue was made in discussions held last week between the NCSS and LGH.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act, 2004.  It is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 277, 278 and 292 together.</P>
        <P>In the period referred to by the Deputies a voluntary early retirement scheme has not been available to staff in the Civil Service.  However, there are other arrangements which make provision for retirement earlier than normal pension age in certain circumstances.</P>
        <P>Arrangements for cost-neutral early retirement were introduced in 2005 under Department of Finance Circular 10/2005 and are available in the Civil and Public Service generally.  In broad terms this facility, which was recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions, allows staff who are within ten years of their normal pension age to apply for early retirement with immediate payment of their superannuation benefits.  The benefits are actuarially reduced to ensure that the early payment is cost-neutral to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>In addition retirement before normal pension age with immediate payment of superannuation benefits may be permitted on medical grounds.  For the Deputies information I am including the following table which details the number of staff who retired from the Department in the last five years.</P>

	<P>My Department reviews its policies and procedures in relation to data security on an on-going basis. In relation to laptop devices, encryption facilities are being rolled out and this is nearing completion.  It has also begun the implementation of security management software that will allow for encryption of data being copied to external devices.  A facility to allow for the encryption of sensitive email traffic is also being examined.  My Department is participating in the Working Group on the Protection of Personal Data set up by the Department of Finance and will be implementing recommendations from this group.  A security handbook has been issued to Departmental staff about good practice in the treatment of personal sensitive data.  In addition, guidelines on records management and email advisories are circulated on a regular basis.  I am satisfied that adequate measures are being taken to protect the security of personal data held in my Department.    </P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Act, 1970 (as amended) provides for two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in the country, i.e. full eligibility (medical card) and limited eligibility (all others).  Entitlement to a medical card is determined mainly by reference to means, with provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo; where the income guidelines are exceeded, while individuals in the second category are required to pay for certain services.</P>
        <P>Medical card holders are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care <Col N="464"/>service.  Determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Individuals with medical cards residing in nursing homes have the same eligibility to services as those in the community.</P>
        <P>I believe that the availability of services such as of physiotherapy, chiropody, dental care and occupational therapy should not be dependent on where the individual is residing.</P>

	<P>Regulation (EC) 1408/71 deals with the coordination of social security, including health care, for those moving within the European Union. Under its provisions, persons residing in Ireland who are attached to the social security system of another member state are entitled to receive health care services in Ireland at the cost of the member state with which they are affiliated. This is in accordance with Annex VI of the Regulation (text relating to Ireland)  which states that such persons &ldquo;are entitled free of charge to all medical treatment provided for by Irish legislation where the cost of this treatment is payable by the institution of a Member State other than Ireland.&rdquo; Such persons receive a medical card as evidence of their entitlement, although this is not based on national legislation.</P>
        <P>Such persons include those who are residing in Ireland but employed in another member state; the dependant family members residing in Ireland of people employed in another <Col N="466"/>member state; and pensioners of another member state residing in Ireland who are not also Irish pensioners or employed in Ireland, and their dependants.</P>
        <P>In regard to the number of such pensioners residing in Ireland, the most recent statistics provided to my Department indicate that, in 2006, of the 110,000 pensioners resident in Ireland in receipt of a contributory pension from the UK, approximately 51,000 were entitled to hold a medical card under the provisions of the Regulation. In regard to other persons holding medical cards by virtue of their entitlement under the Regulation, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Health Service Executive to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issue directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 301 to 304, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am aware that Dublin Port Company has made an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 to reclaim 21 hectares, in order to facilitate proposed infrastructure development.</P>
        <P>While planning applications are operational matters for the port company, the strategic infrastructure planning regulations list a number of &ldquo;prescribed bodies&rdquo; that must be consulted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la prior to any decision being reached. In this instance, the Minister for Transport is such a &ldquo;prescribed body&rdquo; and can, therefore, expect to be consulted on the application as part of the planning process.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan 2007-2013 provides for a comprehensive study of the role of Dublin Port, taking account of locational considerations, in the context of overall ports policy on the island of Ireland, wider transport policy, urban development policy, the National Spatial Strategy and national economic policy. My Department has commissioned Indecon International Economic Consultants to undertake this study and a final report is expected in early 2009.</P>
        <P>The political agreements that An Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor entered into, as leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, with certain deputies are confidential, but they are, as always, based upon the Programme for Government, which incorporates the National Development Plan, approved Government programmes and the annual estimates.</P>

        <P>The Department of Transport seeks the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to applications for an exemption from this prohibition. If the weapons/munitions are classified as &lsquo;dangerous goods&rsquo; by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the application is also forwarded to the Irish Aviation Authority.

        <P>All personal data in electronic format is protected using industry best practices. Access to such data is restricted to those officers who have a business requirement to use it. Mechanisms are in place to remotely delete data from any laptop stolen from the Department, which connects to the Internet. Data that has been transferred from my Department&rsquo;s network to laptops is automatically encrypted. All portable devices are password protected when issued to staff.</P>
        <P>Personal data on physical files is secured by restricted access to buildings and is locked away in filing cabinets to which only appropriate staff members have access.</P>
        <P>Data security measures are regularly reviewed in my Department in the light of changing circumstances.  A review is currently underway and its findings are expected to be implemented by early 2009.  This review will include, but not be limited to, the security policy for portable electronic data devices.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 319 to 321, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The emerging preferred route for Metro West was announced by the RPA in July 2007.  The selected route alignment will connect Tallaght, Clondalkin, Liffey Valley, Blanchardstown with Metro North at Metro Park, close to Dublin Airport. It will also provide integration with the Luas Red Line at Tallaght, the Kildare and Maynooth suburban rail lines and the new Lucan Luas line to be delivered under Transport 21.</P>
        <P>A further round of consultation is now underway to provide greater definition to certain elements of the route after which the RPA will proceed with the preparation of a Railway Order application. The RPA has spent &euro;3.46 million to the end of September on consultation, planning and design for Metro West.</P>
        <P>The start and completion dates of Transport 21 projects, such as Metro West, which have not yet commenced will be determined by the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate.  The provision of increased capacity will be a key priority in determining public transport investment priorities in the period ahead.</P>
        <P>I am not in a position to publish the estimated capital cost of the Metro West project in advance of the completion of the public procurement process. The publication of such commercially sensitive information prior to the completion of the competitive procurement process would prejudice the State&rsquo;s capacity to derive maximum value for money in respect of the project.</P>

	<P>On the 10th October 2008, the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) published the emerging preferred route corridor for the Luas line to Lucan (Line F) following extensive public consultation.  </P>
        <P>Having selected the route corridor, the RPA is now undertaking the next phase of consultation with key stakeholders which will feed into the detailed design of the line.   Following completion of this work the RPA will submit a Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of this line. The RPA is not required to report to me in relation to the selection of preferred routes.</P>
        <P>I am not in a position to give any information in relation to the budget for Luas Line F project in advance of the completion of the public procurement process.  It is intended to procure the project mainly through a Public Private Partnership. The publication of such commercially sensitive information prior to the completion of the competitive procurement process <Col N="475"/>would prejudice the State&rsquo;s capacity to derive maximum value for money in respect of the project.</P>

        <P>Cavan County Council is procuring engineering consultants to prepare a feasibility report for the East/West Link Road. Following the satisfactory outcome of this study the consultants will carry out the preliminary design of the regional and local road section of the road.

        <P FLI="0">It is, of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing  community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I agree with the view expressed by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled &ldquo;Policing in Ireland&mdash;Looking Forward&rdquo; that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland. I am also looking forward to receiving from the Commissioner, in the near future, a copy of the final report of a working group developing proposals for a comprehensive model of rural and urban community policing.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the allocation of Community Garda&iacute; will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the policing throughout the country.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Explosives Act 1875 provides for the control of the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks.  Accordingly, fireworks may not be imported into the State except under an importation licence granted by my Department.  It is long standing policy that these licences are granted only for organised displays conducted by competent and professional operators. Details of licences issued by my Department are set out in the following table.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy may be aware, the Explosives Act, 1875 provides for the control of the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks.  The 1875 Act was amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 which came into effect in August 2006, to provide for new offences governing the possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply.  They also provided for significantly increased penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the provisions, it is an offence: for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence; to throw an ignited firework at any person or property; and to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.</P><Col N="478"/>
        <P Just="Left">The penalty for such offences is now a fine of up to &euro;10,000 or 5 years&rsquo; imprisonment or both.  The simple possession of fireworks without a licence is also an offence for which a person may be liable to a fine of up to &euro;10,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the new offences and increased penalties that now exist, the enforcement capability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is greatly strengthened in combating the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.  In this regard, I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that there were 64 seizures of fireworks recorded for 2007, worth an estimated &euro;31,307 and there are 28 seizures recorded to date in 2008 worth almost &euro;24,000.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is the period around now that seizures would be expected to be at their highest.  I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to intensifying Garda activity against fireworks and other anti-social behaviour during the Hallowe&rsquo;en period. The Commissioner has assured me that activity is being undertaken.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s 2008 Policing Plan contains the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals to realign Garda Divisional boundaries to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  One of the principle reasons for these changes is to facilitate both local Garda and local authority management in the administration of Joint Policing Committees as provided for under Section 22(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</P>
        <P>On 24 September, I launched, along with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the roll out of the Joint Policing Committees established by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to local authority areas in the State beyond the 29 already established under a pilot phase.  I believe that these Committees are a very significant development which will make policing more responsive to local needs.</P>

	<P>I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to intensifying Garda activity against fireworks and other anti-social behaviour during the Hallowe&rsquo;en period. The Commissioner has assured me that that activity is being undertaken.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Explosives Act, 1875 provides for the control of the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks.  The 1875 Act was amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 which came into effect in August 2008, to provide for new offences governing the possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply. It also provided for significantly increased penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the provisions, it is an offence for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence, to throw an ignited firework at any person or property, and to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The penalty for such offences is now a fine of up to &euro;10,000 or 5 years&rsquo; imprisonment or both.  An information campaign has started, in the national and regional newspapers, to highlight to <Col N="480"/>the public the dangers of fireworks and the significant penalties that exist for illegal use. The campaign will run for the next two weeks up to Hallowe&rsquo;en.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that Operation &lsquo;Tombola&rsquo; &mdash; an annual Garda operation &mdash; is in place for policing during the Hallowe&rsquo;en period.  A few weeks ago I spoke with him about intensifying the campaign this year.   Operational Orders have been put in place in every Garda Region, in particular in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and Border Divisions to prevent and detect the organised importation for sale of fireworks in the lead up to Halloween and to police the Hallowe&rsquo;en period.    Persons suspected of engaging in the importation, supply or sale of fireworks will be identified and targeted. Intelligence-led operations and searches will be conducted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also engaging with local communities, Local Authorities and other stakeholders, such as Dublin Bus, in putting plans in place to address the issues that arise around the Hallowe&rsquo;en period. Through the Schools Programme and other local programmes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also emphasise that fireworks are illegal and highlight the dangers associated with illegally imported fireworks. Garda&iacute; have a liaison mechanism in place with Local Authorities for the removal of identified stockpiles of combustible materials, in advance of 31st October 2008. Garda&iacute; have also advised Managers of Off-Licences to ensure that staff are apprised of their obligations and responsibilities under Licensing legislation relating to the sale of alcohol, in particular to underage persons.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that proactive policing arrangements are in place covering the period coming up to and the night of the 31st October 2008. Additional patrols will be carried out by Uniform personnel as part of high-visibility policing initiatives supported by plain-clothes personnel, including District Detective and Drug Units, Divisional Crime Task Force, Traffic Corps personnel and Community Policing and Mountain Bike Units. The provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 will be rigidly enforced.</P>
        <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, which came into effect on 30th July, 2008, made &lsquo;Theatre Licences&rsquo; subject to the prohibited hours&rsquo; provisions for the sale and consumption of alcohol. The new Act also introduced new prohibited hours for off-licences and new conditions for the issuing of off-licences and theatre licences. Provision is also made to seize alcohol and to issue Fixed Charge Penalty Notices for certain offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Local policing plans are predicated on the prevention of anti-social and public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property; and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents.  Patrols are directed to pay particular attention to these areas where local youths tend to congregate and where the likelihood of both anti-social behaviour and drinking on the streets may occur in order to reduce incidences of public disorder and anti-social behaviour type activities, particularly at this time of year.</P>

Additional Garda&iacute;, including a dedicated public order unit, are deployed in the area, particularly during weekends and when events are being held, to prevent and detect anti-social behaviour and other public disorder offences.

        <P>A policing strategy, proportionate to anti-social issues in the Garda District generally, has been put in place by local Garda management to target public order and other anti-social type behaviour offences.

        <P>Current policing plans in the area are predicated on the prevention of anti-social behaviour and public disorder, the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents.

These issues were also addressed in the Fines Bill published in 2007 which is still on the Order Paper.  Work has also been on-going in my Department on the preparation of additional provisions which will give the courts new powers to deal with the situation where a person fails to pay a fine by the due date for payment.  </P>
        <P>As the proposed new Bill will incorporate redrafted provisions contained in the Bill published last year, I intend to seek government approval to withdraw the 2007 Bill from the D&aacute;il Order Paper on publication of the Bill currently being drafted. So as not to give an impression that there are two separate Fines Bills, the Enforcement of Fines Bill has been excluded from the current session&rsquo;s legislative programme.</P>

Under the terms of the Scheme, employees may retire between the ages of 50 and 59 on a reduced pension, at no net cost to the Exchequer.  It should be pointed out that this is not a redundancy scheme and that staff who retire under the Scheme derive no additional financial benefit from availing of the Scheme.  These staff are replaced in the normal course.  In the period 1 April 2004 to 30 September 2008, a total of 5 staff in my Department and its Agencies have availed of the Scheme.</P>

	<P>It is the view of Garda management that the areas in question are adequately covered by Garda&iacute; from Clondalkin, Tallaght and Rathcoole stations which, at the end of September, had personnel strengths of 101, 187 and 28 respectively.  Rathcoole Garda station is open to the public between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. (closed between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.). However, patrols are performed on a 24 hour basis from the station by uniform and plain-clothes personnel, including detective, Community Policing and Mountain-bike units.  Any extension of the current opening hours of Rathcoole Garda station would restrict the mobile service being provided to the local residential and business communities. The situation will continue to be monitored and kept under constant review. The policing accommodation needs of the station will be considered in the context of the Garda Accommodation Programme Board which has been established under the chairmanship of the Chief Administration Officer to prepare a long-term accommodation strategy for the Force. </P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account.

        <P>The provision of a secure digital radio service for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already well underway.  The selected service provider, TETRA Ireland Ltd., is currently putting in place the <Col N="489"/>requisite infrastructure.  The Garda authorities advise that they are working closely with the service provider so that rollout of the service to members of the Force will closely follow the provision of the infrastructure.  Operation of the new digital radio service is scheduled to commence in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in Spring, 2009, with nationwide coverage to be achieved over a 2 year period.  I am further advised by the Garda authorities that rollout of the service in the Limerick Division is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2010.</P>

        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 13 April 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>.

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 10 December 2002. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 9 December 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned at that time.</P>
        <P>The person concerned subsequently submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I.

When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might wish to note that the person concerned also made an application for permission to remain in the State in accordance with the revised arrangements applicable to the non-EEA national parents of Irish born children, born in the State before 1 January 2005.  The revised arrangements in question, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 Scheme, were announced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 15 January 2005.  The person concerned did not fulfil the requirement of the Scheme in that he did not provide evidence that he was the parent or legal guardian of an Irish born child.  He was made aware of the refusal of his IBC/05 application by letter dated 14 November 2005.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that the granting of Irish Citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and that it is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>Applications for a certificate of naturalisation on behalf of the persons referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question were received in the Citizenship Section of my Department in August 2008.</P><Col N="491"/>
        <P>Applications on behalf of minors are dealt with by a separate unit in the Citizenship Section.  Because they generally require less processing than standard adult applications, it is usually possible to finalise them more quickly.

        <P>On examination of the applications submitted it was determined that three out of the four applications did not meet the statutory residency requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended.

	<P>The Fulbright Commission (Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange) provides scholarships to Irish citizens to lecture, research or study in the United States and for US citizens to lecture, research or study in Ireland. The Commission has supported more than 1,600 Irish postgraduate students, academics and professionals who have studied in top US colleges and research institutes and more than 600 US students and scholars have come to Ireland. In this academic year, 21 Irish students and 9 scholars will study in the US. </P><Col N="492"/>

<P el="5">1. All Discipline Fulbright Awards</P>
<P el="5">2. Irish Studies / Language Fulbright Awards</P>
<P el="5">3. International Fulbright Science &amp; Technology Award &mdash; for students only</P>
<P el="5">4. Fulbright &mdash; Schuman Award.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The deadline for applications for the 2009-2010 academic year is the 5th of December 2008. Further details and information on applications can be found on the Fulbright Commission&rsquo;s website <i>http://www.fulbright.ie/</i></P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science part-funds two projects which may overlap with the area of interest, The Washington Ireland Programme and The Wider Horizons Programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Washington Ireland Programme has been in operation since 1995.  It extends the opportunity to promising university students from Ireland north and south to partake in summer career training and professional development in the US (mainly Washington).  The objective of this programme is to bring together young adults from all traditions in Ireland who show potential leadership qualities and provide them with a first hand experience of US government and culture.  In 2007, thirty outstanding third level college students participated in the Washington Ireland Programme.  Further details and information on applications can be found on the Washington Ireland Programme website<i> http://www.wiprogram.org</i>.</P>
        <P>The Wider Horizons Programme commenced in 1988.  It involves student teachers from both religious communities in Ireland north and south.  The four teacher training colleges involved are St. Patrick&rsquo;s College and Church of Ireland College in the south, and St. Mary&rsquo;s College and Stranmillis College in the north.  The programme is a working model of a cross-community, cross-tradition, cross-border and cross-cultural venture, concerned with professional development, reconciliation and mutual understanding.</P>
        <P>In 2007 for example, 13 Irish student teachers, (5 from the south and 8 from the north) spent 6 weeks teaching in Lowell, Massachusetts, USA, in school-based summer projects for young people in disadvantaged and multi-cultural urban areas.</P>

        <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme announced in 2003, 125 posts attached to the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs were to <Col N="493"/>decentralise to Limerick.  Following sanction of additional posts by the Department of Finance in 2005, the total number of posts from the Division transferring to Limerick increased to 138.</P>
        <P>I expect that the decentralisation of Irish Aid will be completed next month, with staff at that stage moving to permanent premises. Already, there are 84 officials based in interim office premises in Limerick.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works is responsible for the provision of office accommodation for Irish Aid in Limerick. The property related costs associated with the decentralisation programme are a charge on that Office.</P>
        <P>The table underneath sets out the non-property costs incurred by this Department during the period 2004-2008. The increase experienced in 2007 relates to the costs associated with the establishment of interim offices in Limerick in May of that year.</P>

	<P>All data held in my Department, including personal data, is protected by both physical and technical safeguards.  My Department&rsquo;s policy is that all portable electronic data devices are encrypted.  Full hard disk encryption has been implemented on all laptops issued by my Department in the past three years.  The Department does not issue blackberry devices and the small number of hand held devices we do have are used purely for scheduling and official contacts purposes. </P>
        <P>I am satisfied that all personal information held within my Department is secure.  All officials are bound by the provisions of the Official Secrets Act.  In addition, on the day of their appointment, all officials of my Department are made aware of their responsibilities under the Data Protection Acts.  Each Division has a nominated Data Protection Coordinator and, earlier this year, my Department launched a dedicated Data Protection Intranet Page, to facilitate and encourage ongoing awareness of data protection responsibilities among all staff.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Data Protection Acts are kept under regular review by my Department, to ensure our ongoing compliance.  The categories of personal data retained by my Department are reviewed annually, to ensure that our obligation to register these with the Data Protection Commissioner is discharged.</P>
        <P>Over the past year, the Department has been placing a particular focus on increasing awareness among all staff of their obligations under the Data Protection Acts and is working with the Office of the DPC in this regard.  The Data Protection Commissioner recently gave a briefing to the Department&rsquo;s Data Protection Divisional Coordinators and we will continue to liaise with his Office.</P>

	<P>At the outset, I would like again to express my deepest sympathy to the family concerned.  My Department became aware of the case mentioned by the Deputy in December 2006 and considerable consular assistance was provided, including assistance in the repatriation of the remains of the deceased. The authorities in Botswana conducted enquiries into the death of the deceased, following which a post mortem was held. A verdict of suicide was returned, with the cause of death stated to be due to haemorrhage and shock. Throughout that period, our Honorary Consul in Botswana <Col N="496"/>remained in contact with the local authorities. However, the findings of the Botswana authorities are not accepted by one member of the family of the deceased. </P>
        <P>Officials from the Consular Division have met with the family of the deceased and are, of course, ready to provide all appropriate further consular assistance to them.</P>

As that letter pointed out, given the level of demand for funding and the amount of funding available under the Programme, it is not possible for my Department to allocate grants to every applicant.  In this instance, the project did not meet two of the qualifying conditions of the Programme in that the proof of title provided and the evidence of own funding submitted were not sufficient.  There are no funds available to the Department to meet the rising costs of sports facilities.  </P>

The Department, which has a staff of 130, excluding the National Archives, was designated an &ldquo;early mover&rdquo; by the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG). To date, 76 staff have relocated to temporary accommodation in Fossa, Killarney. The objective is to complete the decentralisation process of the Department by early 2009 by which time it will be operating from the new purpose built offices in Killarney.   The annual non-property costs incurred by this Department in the implementation of the decentralisation scheme for each of the past four years are set out in the table.</P>

	<P>Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Since 1998 the Government has allocated over &euro;725m in sports capital funding to over 7,400 sports projects across the country.  </P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the scale of these investments warrants my Department requiring grantees to comply with certain terms and conditions.  These include, inter alia, requirements in relation to tendering to ensure value for money and legal requirements to protect the state&rsquo;s investments for larger allocations and ensure that facilities funded stay in sporting use.  Staff in my Department liaise, on an ongoing basis, with grant recipients to assist in progressing payments as promptly as possible.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind my Department will be happy to investigate if he will forward the details to me.</P>

The data in respect of the previous three years is not readily available due to major restructuring of the Department in May 2005 which resulted in the establishment of the National Library and the National Museum as separate statutory organisations which retain the details of its staff members. It has not been possible to obtain the information requested within the time frame available.</P>

	<P>One of the eligibility criteria for farmers wishing to participate on the Rural Social Scheme (RSS) is that they are actively farming.  In order to satisfy that condition farmers wishing to participate in the scheme must occupy and farm in their own right and at their own risk, a minimum of 1 Hectare of land within the State, which is used solely for the purposes of carrying out an agricultural activity. This is in line with guidelines issued by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. </P>
        <P>An RSS participant is not required to be in receipt of a Single Farm Payment. However, according to EU regulation (REG No. 183/2005) those involved in farming activities are required to make a declaration under the Single Farm Payment Scheme annually. A copy of the Single Payment Scheme Application together with official proof of postage is one of the documents acceptable in order to demonstrate that a farmer is actively farming for the purposes of the RSS.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  Mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. </P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned applied for mortgage interest supplement in February 2008.  One of the statutory conditions for receipt of mortgage interest supplement is that, in the opinion of the Executive, the person must have been in a position, at the time the loan agreement was entered into, to meet the repayments under that agreement.  The Executive has advised that the person concerned was refused mortgage interest supplement as, in its opinion, the loan agreement was entered into at a time when the person concerned was not in a position to make the repayments.  It is also the opinion of the Executive that the loan was not obtained for the purpose of purchasing, repairing or improving the residence of the person concerned.</P><Col N="506"/>
        <P>The Executive has further advised that the decision to refuse mortgage supplement was upheld by the HSE Appeals Office.  The person concerned has been advised of her right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

        <P>As outlined in Budget 2009, the Government, following a review of the decentralisation programme, in light of the changed economic circumstances and the deterioration in public finances, agreed a revised schedule for the programme.

	<P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 410 and 431 together. </P>
        <P>The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is designed to help those who have not worked for some time to improve their employability and job-readiness by acquiring educational qualifications. It is a recognition of the special difficulties which such persons can face when attempting to gain a foothold in the labour market.  The allowance is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the  scheme.  It essentially replaces their existing social welfare income and in addition an annual &euro;500 cost of education allowance is payable.</P><Col N="507"/>
        <P>In general, an applicant must be at least 21 years of age and in receipt of a relevant Social Welfare payment for 6 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  People in receipt of disability related payments, may access the scheme at 18 years of age provided they have been out of formal education for at least 2 years.  Time spent in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance can count towards the qualifying period for back to education allowance in circumstances where the person establishes an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
        <P>In addition, the qualifying period for access to the third level option has been reduced to 9 months for persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process and where a F&Aacute;S Employment Services Officer recommends pursuance of a third level course of study as essential to the enhancement of the individual&rsquo;s employment prospects.</P>
        <P>From September 2007 the qualifying period for illness benefit recipients was reduced from three to two years and people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the BTEA scheme and is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.</P>
        <P>The current scheme has been subject to review and modification over the years to ensure it continues to support those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.  I will continue to monitor the scheme but I believe that, overall, the back to education allowance scheme continues to meet its objectives and ensures that limited resources are targeted at those who are most in need.  If the Deputies wish to provide details of specific cases, I will ensure that they receive immediate attention from the relevant department officials.</P>

	<P>The School Meals Programme gives funding towards the provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes.  The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs.  The second is the School Meals Local Projects scheme through which funding is provided directly by this Department to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who are running their own school meals projects. </P>
        <P>The School Meals Programme has expanded significantly in recent years. Expenditure on the urban and local projects school meals schemes increased from &euro;13.6m in 2006 to &euro;28.2m in 2007, and is expected to be in the region of &euro;32m in 2008. In 2006, 1,389 schools and 125,000 pupils benefited from the programme and this increased to over 189,000 pupils from over 1,900 schools in 2007.</P>
        <P>Funding under the School Meals Local Projects scheme is available for a variety of school meals projects, including breakfast clubs, snack clubs, lunch clubs, dinner clubs and homework clubs.  The decision to operate a school meals projects, and responsibility for the actual operation of the project, rests entirely with the school or organisation concerned. Funding under the scheme is to assist participating schools/organisations with their food costs only.</P><Col N="508"/>
        <P>Priority for funding under the School Meals Local Projects scheme is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education &amp; Science&rsquo;s initiative for disadvantage schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  The focus of the School Meals scheme will remain on disadvantaged children and the inclusion of additional DEIS schools in the scheme will continue to be the Department&rsquo;s main priority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The following table gives a breakdown by county of the numbers of schools/preschools/local groups which have benefited under the School Meals Local Projects scheme.  These figures include a variety of different types of school food projects, including schools who receive funding directly from the Department for either their full school population or for targeted pupils and also school food projects funded by the Department and operated by local and voluntary organisations for pupils from a number of local schools.

	<P>The Government discussion paper, &ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents,&rdquo; put forward proposals to tackle obstacles to employment for lone parents and other low income families.  These included proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children. </P>
        <P>Under the proposals the lone parenthood category of payment would no longer exist.  Instead, a new payment would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner), with young children, on low income.  This new payment is currently being developed in the Department, taking into account the various issues raised in the consultation process.</P>
        <P>Any proposed new payment scheme can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place on the ground by other relevant Departments and Agencies.  This is why the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion has been tasked with bringing forward a plan on the key issues of childcare, education, training and activation measures.</P>
        <P>The non-income recommendations contained in the discussion paper were examined in two areas: Coolock and Kilkenny.  These studies, which took place between November 2007 and February 2008, were carried out to facilitate the development of the policy and operational details of the new scheme.  The process involved both lone parents and qualified adults. It was carried out on a voluntary basis and the take-up was low.</P>
        <P>The experience has however highlighted how both lone parents and qualified adults are not a homogenous group, are of different ages, have experienced different routes into their current situation and have different needs.  Educational levels of those who participated were generally low, there was little or no engagement with F&Aacute;S, some participants intended to return to full or part-time work when their child was a few months old; others, however, had been out of the work force for a considerable period of time. Earnings from previous employment were generally low.  For almost all of those intending to return to work affordable childcare was a critical issue.</P>
        <P>The experience of this engagement process is feeding into the development of our approach to working with lone parents and qualified adults to support them into education, training and employment.</P>

	<P>The claim of the person concerned for disability allowance was disallowed by a Deciding Officer of the Department on 4 February 2008 following an examination by a Medical Assessor who expressed the opinion that he was medically unsuitable for the allowance.  He appealed this decision on 19 February 2008 and, in the context of this appeal, he was examined by a second Medical Assessor on 18 August 2008 who also expressed the opinion he was unsuitable. </P>
        <P>I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, in the light of this second medical opinion, that Office, on 20 August 2008, decided to afford him an opportunity of setting out <Col N="510"/>the complete and up to date grounds of his appeal and to furnish any further medical evidence he wished to submit in support of his appeal.

	<P>The Department currently has bilateral social security agreements with 7 countries:- Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United States, Quebec and Switzerland.  Liaison procedures to ensure the secure transfer of personal data have been established with each country, and are kept under constant review. Regular contact is maintained by the Department with each agency to ensure the timely and, accurate provision of the required information. </P>
        <P>The processing time for claims that fall to be examined under bilateral agreements can be longer than that for standard Irish entitlements, reflecting the added complexity that arises in determining entitlements under these agreements, and the necessity to obtain the relevant insurance details from overseas social security institutions.</P>
        <P>Delays in processing applications can occur where a person has had a varied employment history in a number of countries over their working life.  Where any such delay occurs there is no loss to the pensioners as payments are made from the due entitlement date.  Overall, I am satisfied that the current arrangements and procedures are working effectively and efficiently.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if she will introduce a full disability occupational injury payment or equivalent for those affected by pneumoconiosis, if they are deemed to be only partially affected by the illness; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Pneumoconiosis is a prescribed disease for the purpose of the Occupational Injuries scheme administered by the Department.  The legislation governing the Occupational Injuries Scheme provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where that person has contracted that disease in the course of their employment. </P>
        <P>Where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, benefits are payable if they were employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease or if they can show, to the satisfaction of the Chief Medical Advisor in the Department, that the disease was contracted through an employment not specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.</P>
        <P>Employment under a contract of service is insurable for Occupational Injuries Benefit under the Social Welfare Acts.  An insured person who contracts pneumoconiosis may qualify for disablement benefit under that scheme, in addition to illness benefit under the general social insurance scheme, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions.  Medical assessments are under<Col N="511"/>taken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with a person of the same age and gender.</P>
        <P>Persons claiming Occupational Injuries Benefit in cases of Pneumoconiosis are referred to Consultant Respiratory Physicians in the first instance for an examination and report.  This examination consists of a clinical assessment and pulmonary function testing (PFT).  Disablement benefit is awarded on the basis of the consultant&rsquo;s report, including the pulmonary function test result.  The degree of disablement is expressed as a percentage of loss of faculty and the compensation payable varies accordingly.  Loss of faculty may be determined within a range of less than 1% to 100%, depending on the severity of the condition.  Currently, there are 23 people in receipt of disablement benefit as a result of contracting pneumoconiosis arising from their occupation, of which 19 are former coal miners and 4 were in employments prescribed in relation to asbestos.  The percentage of disablement assessed in these cases ranges from 8% to 90%.  A person must be assessed as having a minimum of 20% loss of faculty before they may be considered as being incapable of work due to their disablement.  These arrangements apply generally and there are no plans for special arrangements in the case of pneumoconiosis.</P>
        <P>Where a person qualifies for disablement benefit, the rate of benefit increases on an annual basis in line with the normal social welfare budget increases.  In addition, where a person feels that his/her condition has deteriorated since the assessment was made under the scheme, it is open to that person to apply for a review of the disablement percentage calculated.</P>

	<P>Social welfare has been prioritised in this Budget.  Next year, total funding for the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be &euro;19.6 billion.  This represents an increase of &euro;2.6 billion or 15.5% over the Estimates allocation for 2008. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Over 1.7 million people and their dependants will benefit from this expenditure &mdash; including 440,000 pensioners, 345,000 ill and disabled people, over 80,000 carers, 30,000 low income working families availing of the Family Income Supplement and over 580,000 families that receive child benefit payments.</P>
        <P>Even in these difficult economic times, the Government has prioritised delivering real increases in social welfare payments.  The Budget provides for increases of between 3 and 3.8% in the basic payment rates next year or ahead of projected inflation of 2.5% for next year.  These increases are also in line with the wage rises agreed by the social partners in the 2nd phase of the National Pay Agreement.</P>
        <P>In addition, the fuel allowance increases by an extra &euro;2 per week with payment also being made for an additional 2 weeks.  In relation to means testing arrangements, improvements are being made to the Family Income Supplement which is paid to low income working families.  The income limits for the FIS are being increased by &euro;10 per week in respect of each child giving an average extra payment of &euro;6 per child per week.</P><Col N="512"/>
        <P>Furthermore, the income thresholds for entitlement to Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance are also being increased to enable 18,000 more families to benefit from the scheme.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the position in regard to qualification for retirement or old age pension for those who gave up work to care for a person with special needs with particular reference to the allocation of credit contributions for the period of care; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In order to qualify for the maximum rate of the state pension (contributory) a person must, amongst other qualifying conditions, achieve a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited on his/her social insurance record over their working life.  Reduced pensions are paid to those with yearly averages as low as 10 contributions. </P>
        <P>The contributory pension entitlements of those who leave employment to care for children or incapacitated people can be protected in a number of ways. People who qualify for payments such as carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit may, subject to conditions, qualify for credited contributions.</P>
        <P>If a person does not qualify for credits through the carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit schemes they may be able to avail of the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme.  This was introduced from 1994 and allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  Any person, including a carer, may pay voluntary contributions once they satisfy certain qualifying conditions.  A person may choose to pay voluntary contributions, provided they are no longer covered by a PRSI scheme on a compulsory basis in this country or on a compulsory or voluntary basis in any other E.U. country. Voluntary contributions provide cover for long-term benefits, such as pensions.</P>
        <P>To become a voluntary contributor a person must have paid at least 260 PRSI contributions in either employment or self-employment and apply within 12 months of the end of the contribution year during which they last paid compulsory insurance or were last awarded a credited contribution.  The person must agree to pay voluntary contributions from the start of the contribution week that follows the week in which they left compulsory insurance.</P>
        <P>From June 2006, the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self employment, education or training outside the home and still be eligible for carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.  Where a carer remains in employment he or she will continue to pay the appropriate social insurance contribution.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied that adequate arrangements are in place to protect the pension entitlements of people who leave employment to provide full-time care.  There are, of course, people caring who cannot benefit from these measures.  The position of these, and others who are at present not receiving support through the social welfare pension system, is discussed in the Green Paper on Pensions and decisions in relation to them will be made in the context of the framework for future pensions policy which I expect to finalise by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) Scheme is designed to help those who have not worked for some time to improve their employability and job-readiness by acquiring educational qualifications.  It is a recognition of the special difficulties which such persons can face when attempting to gain a foothold in the labour market. </P>
        <P>The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the BTEA scheme and is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.  The allowance is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  It essentially replaces their existing social welfare income and in addition an annual &euro;500 cost of education allowance is payable.</P>
        <P>To qualify for participation an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  However, lone parents and persons in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years.</P>
        <P>In general, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant Social Welfare payment for 6 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  However, since 2007, people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the Back to Education Allowance scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  In addition, the qualifying period for access to the third level option has been reduced to 9 months for persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process and where a F&Aacute;S Employment Services Officer recommends pursuance of a third level course of study as essential to the enhancement of the individual&rsquo;s employment prospects.</P>
        <P>The current scheme has been subject to review and modification over the years to ensure it continues to support those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.  I will continue to monitor the scheme but I believe that, overall, the back to education allowance scheme continues to meet its objectives and ensures that limited resources are targeted at those who are most in need.  The number of participants on the BTEA scheme has increased in recent years, supported by a growth in expenditure on the scheme from &euro;38 million in 2003 to a provision of &euro;70 million this year.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. </P>
        <P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods.  There are currently over 68,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 14% since the end of December 2007.  Almost 32,000 are getting a supplement for 18 months or more.  For this reason, the rent supplement scheme has to be viewed in the context of overall housing policy, particularly in the case of long-term recipients.</P>
        <P>The Government introduced new rental assistance arrangements which came into effect in 2005 and included the rental accommodation scheme (RAS).</P>
        <P>The RAS gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more, on a phased implementation basis.  Since 2005, over 15,800 rent supplement recipients have been assessed for RAS and have had their housing needs met by their local authority. 8,300 of these are accommodated under RAS and 7,500 have transferred to other social housing options.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements to the means test for rent supplement were implemented in 2007 specifically to facilitate people returning to full-time work who had been accepted as eligible for accommodation under RAS.  These measures are positive steps in assisting tenants in achieving a long-term housing solution for their needs.</P>
        <P>Mortgage interest supplement also provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  There are currently 6,600 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, a 60% increase on the numbers receiving the supplement at the end of 2007.</P>
        <P>Improvements to the rent and mortgage interest supplement means test were implemented in June 2007 providing for a gradual withdrawal of the supplement as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  This ensures that those returning to part-time work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</P>
        <P>Rent and mortgage interest supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum weekly contribution which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.  When last set in 2004, the minimum contribution represented approximately 10% of the minimum social welfare weekly payment rate. While social welfare payments have risen by nearly &euro;70 per week since then, no upward adjustment has been made to the minimum contribution.</P>
        <P>As part of Budget 2009, I announced my intention to increase the minimum contribution from &euro;13 to &euro;18 with effect from 1 January 2009 which will represent 8.8% of the basic social welfare weekly payment.  It will also significantly reduce the differential between the contribution which rent supplement tenants pay and the contribution payable under the local authority differential rent scheme. Some 68,763 people are currently receiving rent supplement and <Col N="515"/>6,729 are receiving mortgage interest supplement, increases of 15% and 64% respectively, on the number receiving these supplements at the end of 2007.  Almost 47,000 new rent supplements and over 5,000 new mortgage interest supplements have been awarded since the start of the year.  This indicates that the schemes are effective in meeting the needs of those who require assistance with their accommodation costs.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the current rent and mortgage interest supplement schemes provide an adequate short-term &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; within the overall social welfare system.  Nonetheless I intend to keep the schemes under review to ensure that they meet the objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis while long-term housing needs are dealt with in a more appropriate manner.  The Department will also continue working closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</P>

	<P>Since April 2000, the needs of asylum seekers are catered for under the direct provision system operated by the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform. People in direct provision are not regarded as being habitually resident in the state and are not entitled to any social welfare payment which is subject to the habitual residence condition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the direct provision system, asylum seekers are provided with full board, accommodation and other facilities such as laundry services and access to leisure areas.  To take account of the services provided in direct provision, a weekly allowance of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child is payable in respect of any personal requisites.  If a person opts to leave direct provision accommodation, s/he is still only entitled to the direct provision allowance of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child.</P>
        <P>The Dublin/Mid-Leinster Area of the HSE has advised that the person concerned is an asylum seeker in receipt of a direct provision allowance granted to her and her child dependants.  She previously resided at accommodation provided through the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform but voluntarily left this accommodation in December 2003.</P>
        <P>Following an examination of her entitlement, it appears that she has been paid an amount in excess of the direct provision allowance.  Her entitlement is currently under review and the Executive will notify the person concerned of the outcome of the review.</P>

She was asked to provide further documentation which she did on 3 October 2008.   She has been awarded payment at the rate of &euro;209.80 per week from 17 March 2008.  From 19 June 2008 her rate is &euro;267.80 which includes payment for her three children and her fuel allowance. Her first payment will be in her bank account on Thursday 24 October 2008.

	<P>The person concerned does not appear to have submitted an application for participation in the back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme.  However, the records in the Department show that this person was only in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance from 14 July 2008 to 14 October 2008 and would therefore not appear to meet the requirement to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for a minimum period of time immediately prior to commencing a course of study.</P>
        <P>In general, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant Social Welfare payment for 6 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.</P>
        <P>However, since 2007, people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the Back to Education Allowance scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
        <P>In addition, the qualifying period for access to the third level option has been reduced to 9 months for persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process and where a F&Aacute;S Employment Services Officer recommends pursuance of a third level course of study as essential to the enhancement of the individual&rsquo;s employment prospects.</P>
        <P>The current scheme has been subject to review and modification over the years to ensure it continues to support those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.</P>

	<P>There has been a significant increase in the number of people claiming jobseeker payments since the beginning of the year. The level of inflows to the Live Register over the period January to September 2008 inclusive was 311,660 as compared with 220,652 over the corresponding period last year representing an increase of over 41%. The average monthly inflows over the first nine months was 34,629 as compared with 24,517 over the corresponding period in 2007 and the average weekly inflow was 7,991 as compared with 5,658 in 2007.</P>
        <P>The average processing time for applications for jobseeker&rsquo;s claims processed in September was 3 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and 6 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. Processing times vary between offices. The overall performance in any individual office in processing claims can be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors; including increased inflow of claims, staff vacancies and the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office.</P>
        <P>The Department has taken a number of measures to deal with the increased workload arising since the beginning of the year. These measures include the allocation of additional posts to local offices, extending the contracts of some temporary staff and additional resources for overtime. At a local level work is prioritised to deal with claim processing. These measures are kept under review.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most Local Offices of the Department are open to the public from 9.30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and they deal with the clients who attend the office on any given day. Waiting time will depend on the number of people calling to an office. Every effort is made to deal with callers as quickly as possible. However, with the increase in the number of people claiming a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, it is inevitable that waiting times will be affected.</P>

	<P>The school meals programme gives funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes. The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, which is operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department. The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided by the Department to participating schools and voluntary community groups in both urban and rural areas, who are running specific school meals projects.</P>
        <P>There is no record of an application having been received from the school concerned for funding under the school meals local projects scheme. Priority for funding under the scheme is, in the first instance, confined to schools in the Department of Education &amp; Science&rsquo;s initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS). The school mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s question is not a DEIS school.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s current decentralisation programme for the civil and public service, some 1,200 posts comprising the Department&rsquo;s headquarter sections and the Social Welfare Appeals Office are relocating to 6 locations &mdash; Sligo, Carrick-on-Shannon, Donegal Town, Buncrana, Carrickmacross and Drogheda.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To date, 211 posts have relocated from the Department&rsquo;s Dublin Offices to Sligo and Carrick-on-Shannon &mdash; 72 posts to Sligo and 139 posts to Carrick-on-Shannon. An extension to the Department&rsquo;s existing Office in Sligo, for the decentralisation programme to that location, was completed in 2006. The Office of Public Works (OPW) has leased a building in Carrick-on-Shannon for this Department&rsquo;s decentralisation programme and staff assignments commenced mid-2007.</P>
        <P>The Government outlined in Budget 2009 that the decentralisation programme to Buncrana and Drogheda would proceed as planned. A site in Buncrana has been purchased, the building is under construction and the expected completion date of the project is late 2009. The OPW has purchased sites in Drogheda to accommodate the Department&rsquo;s Headquarters and the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
        <P>The Department already have decentralised offices in Longford, Sligo, Letterkenny, Waterford, Dundalk and Roscommon and some 219 employees have transferred to these offices and other offices of the Department to fill vacancies created by the current decentralisation programme. Furthermore, a total of 258 employees of the Department have transferred to other Government Departments for the purposes of their decentralisation programmes.</P>
        <P>As outlined in Budget 2009, the Government has reviewed the Decentralisation Programme in light of the changed economic circumstances and the deterioration in public finances. The remaining elements of the programme for this Department have been deferred pending a review in 2011 in light of the budgetary developments.</P>

	<P>Entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is determined by the particular circumstances and situation that the claimant and his or her dependants are in at the time of the claim. As these circumstances can change during the course of any year, it is not possible therefore, to provide the information requested in the question.</P>
        <P>In the light of the significant pressure on the public finances, and the Social Insurance Fund in particular, it has been necessary to make savings in some areas. However, these expenditure control measures have been kept to an absolute minimum. A number of these measures relate to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, including &ndash;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An increase in the underlying number of paid contributions for entitlement from 52 to 104;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The introduction of a condition whereby 13 paid contributions are required in the relevant tax year; and</P><Col N="521"/>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A reduction in the maximum duration of benefit from 15 months to 12 months for those who have paid contributions for at least 5 full years and a similar reduction from 12 months to 9 months for those who have paid contributions for less than 5 full years.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">However, a person affected by any of these measures will be able to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance instead if they have limited means.</P>
        <P>A further measure that is being introduced is an increase in the current weekly earnings threshold for the payment of reduced rates of benefit from &euro;150 to &euro;300. This measure addresses an anomaly that currently exists where some people who were previously working part-time can receive a higher rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit than what they were earning while at work.</P>
        <P>Some of these expenditure control measures also apply to health and safety benefit. However, given the alternative less stringent methods that are currently available for qualifying for this benefit, the above measures will generally have minimal effect in relation to health and safety benefit.</P>
        <P>The table sets out the estimated numbers of people that will be affected by each measure during 2009 and in a full year, together with the associated savings.</P>

	<P>The Department&rsquo;s policy is that sensitive data should not be stored on laptops or other portable devices.  However, in the event that there is no alternative to local storage, all sensitive data must be appropriately secured.  All new laptops are issued with encryption software.  The Department is currently arranging a recall of its current stock of laptops to install encryption software.</P>
        <P>The Department is also engaged in implementing a policy to restrict usage of USB memory devices.  Members of staff who need such devices will be issued with encrypted devices and future usage will be restricted to these.</P><Col N="523"/>
        <P>Every effort is made by the Department to ensure that personal customer data is used solely for business purposes and that it is not compromised in any way.  Over the past number of years, the Department has continuously strengthened security and data protection protocols.  Policies and procedures governing the use of systems and data have been developed and communicated to the staff.  These policies and procedures are under constant review and are updated as appropriate.  Staff are regularly reminded of their obligations under data protection and security policies and of the penalties applicable in respect of any breach of these policies.</P>
        <P>In addition to the policy measures, the Department is also ensuring that higher levels of data protection are built into its latest generation of ICT systems to reflect the increased threats in this area.  Considerable resources have also been devoted to increasing the security and monitoring facilities in its older systems.</P>

        <Quest> the number of people who are in receipt of a pre-1953 old age contributory pension; if the payments for this pension are less than the non-contributory old age pension; the reason for same; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The special half-rate Pre-1953 State Pension (Contributory) was introduced with effect from 5th May 2000.  To qualify for this pension, a person must have at least 260 full-rate contributions paid. The 260 can be made up solely of pre-1953 contributions, or a mixture of pre and post-1953 contributions. At the end of September 2008, the numbers of people receiving this pension was 26,130.</P>
        <P>The personal rate of pension payable for Pre-1953 pension is half the maximum standard rate of State Pension (Contributory) which is less than the maximum rate of State Pension (Non-Contributory).  The rate of State Pension (Non-Contributory) is subject to a mean test so the rate payable in any case is dependent on the personal circumstance of each individual. Any increases awarded for a qualified adult or dependent child(ren) are also payable at half the standard rate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 445 and 446 together.</P>
        <P>Details of the number of people benefiting from the back to work allowance and the back to education allowance over the past 3 years are set out as follows in tabular format. The tables also show the breakdown for each scheme on a county basis.</P>
        <P>The back to education scheme is a second chance education opportunity designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education. It encourages and facilitates people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. The objective of the scheme is to enhance the employability skills of vulnerable groups who are distant from the labour market.</P>
        <P>The back to work allowance scheme is designed to assist and encourage the long term unemployed, lone parents, people with disabilities and other social welfare recipients to return to the active labour force. These allowances provide a monetary incentive for people who are long term dependant on social welfare payments to make the return to work financially attractive and viable.</P>
        <P>There were no new conditions introduced to these schemes in Budget 2008.  Both of these schemes show increases in the total numbers participating over the past three years.  The numbers availing of the back to work allowance increased by 2%, while the numbers availing of the back to education allowance increased by 22%.  The numbers on the back to education allowance are at their highest level ever and are expected to increase again this year.</P>

	<P>Child Benefit is payable to children who are ordinarily resident in the state or who reside with a qualified person outside the state, while that person is a member of the defence forces, a civil servant posted abroad, a volunteer development worker or who remain insurable under Irish Social insurance while working abroad.</P>
        <P>EU Migrant workers may have an entitlement to Child Benefit and other &ldquo;Family benefits&rdquo; under EU Regulation 1408/71.  Where a national of an EU state is working in Ireland, she/he is entitled to payment of these benefits, even if his/her children are resident in the worker&rsquo;s home country.</P>
        <P>The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72.  The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.  This is achieved primarily by setting out rules as to which State&rsquo;s social security a person will pay insurance when, for example, s/he moves from one Member State to another to take up work or where s/he lives in one State and works in another. In addition, the Regulations also set out rules as to which State will pay benefit in the event of the usual contingencies arising, sickness, unemployment old-age etc.</P>
        <P>The general rule is that a person is insured in the State in which s/he works. Equally, the state of employment has, in general, responsibility for paying benefits when, for example, a person becomes unemployed or ill.  The Regulations also provide that, when entitlement to benefit is being examined, account must be taken of insurance paid in any other Member State where the person worked.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of the EU Regulation, Irish Child Benefit and Early Childcare Supplement are classified as Family Benefits and there are specific rules governing the payment of these benefits.</P>
        <P>Because entitlement to family benefits can often arise in more than one Member State (based on residence and/or employment) the Regulations set out a number of rules in order to determine which country pays family benefits. The main ones are:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Residence requirements in national legislation (such as the habitual residence condition in Ireland) are overridden.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The level of payment of family benefits in the State of employment has priority over the level of payment in the State of residence. If there is employment in two States, the level of payment in the State of residence of the children has priority.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />If the level of payment of family benefits in the State of residence is higher than that in the State of employment, the State of residence is required to pay a supplement equal to the difference between the two amounts.</P>

	<P>Officers who retire from the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs before the minimum retirement age of 60 can only do so either on grounds of ill health, which is subject to the approval of the Chief Medical Officer, or under the terms of the Cost Neutral Early Retirement Scheme, which was introduced in 2004.  This scheme allows officers to retire voluntarily between the ages of 50 and 60 with actuarially reduced pension awards.</P>

        <Quest> the number of staff within agencies within the remit of her Department who have availed of early retirement schemes in each of the past three years; the breakdown of such by the grade and age of the staff who availed of the schemes; the breakdown of the reasons for granting early retirement; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The five statutory bodies operating under the aegis of the Department are the Pensions Board, the Combat Poverty Agency, the Citizens Information Board, the Family Support Agency and the Social Welfare Tribunal. In addition the Pensions Ombudsman comes under the remit of the Department.</P>
        <P>Two members of staff of the Citizens Information Board availed of early retirement in the past three years &mdash; a Grade 3 and a Higher Executive Officer, aged 61 and 64 respectively. Both retired on grounds of ill health.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of this question early retirement is taken to include retirement on grounds of ill health and cost neutral early retirement but not voluntary retirement between the ages of 60 and 65 where the latter age is the compulsory retirement age.</P>

	<P>Self employed people do not have to wait 12 months to get a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment.</P>
        <P>Jobseekers allowance is a means tested payment made to those who do not qualify for jobseekers benefit which is based on PRSI contributions.  The means test involves an assessment of the person&rsquo;s savings and investments, any property s/he may own, apart from the family home and any other income such as a pension from a former employer or from another country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Generally, self-employed persons are assessed with their income in the past 12 months to determine their expected income in the following year.  With the general downturn in the construction industry at the moment it is accepted that less work is available in that sector and that earnings in the previous 12 months may not be representative of expected earnings in the coming year.  The Social Welfare Inspector will take account of this fact in projecting future earnings.</P>

	<P>The claim for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance by the person concerned was refused by a Deciding Officer of the Department on the 15th November 2007 on the grounds that the care recipient was not so invalided or disabled as to need full-time care and attention. </P>
        <P>An appeal was opened on 14 March 2008 and I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, in accordance with the statutory requirements, the Department was asked for the documentation in the case and the Deciding Officer&rsquo;s comments on the grounds of the appeal.</P>
        <P>These have been received and her case has been referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral appeal hearing.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office is an office of the Department that is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on Social Welfare entitlements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The average processing time for applications for jobseeker&rsquo;s claims processed in September was 3 weeks for jobseekers benefit and 6 weeks for jobseekers allowance.</P>
        <P>There has been a significant increase in the number of people claiming since the beginning of the year.  The level of inflows to the Live Register over the period January to September 2008 inclusive was 311,660 as compared with 220,652 over the corresponding period last year representing an increase of over 41%.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  These conditions vary between the two jobseeker schemes and involve, among other things, the need to establish the person&rsquo;s social insurance record, establish the person&rsquo;s identity or their place <Col N="531"/>of habitual residence and to assess means where appropriate.  In some cases delays arise where the person fails to supply all pertinent information in support of their application.</P>
        <P>The overall performance in any individual office in processing claims can be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors; including increased inflow of claims, staff vacancies and the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office.</P>
        <P>The Department has taken a number of measures to deal with the increased workload arising since the beginning of the year.  These measures include the allocation of additional posts to local offices, extending the contracts of some temporary staff and the allocation of additional resources for overtime.  At a local level work is prioritised to deal with claim processing.   These measures are kept under review.</P>

The programme focuses mainly on infrastructural projects comprising the construction of new buildings and the refurbishment of existing buildings.  Given the extensive effort involved in compiling the information in the requested format and the time available, it has not been possible to give a detailed breakdown by county as far back as 1997. However my Department can provide this information from 2004 onwards.</P>

	<P>The Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was established under the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004.</P>
        <P>On the 19th September 2005, Ms. Paulyn Marrinan-Quinn SC was appointed by the President, upon the recommendation of the Government, as the first Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  Her term of office was extended for a further three years from 19th September 2008.</P>
        <P>The function of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is to act as the ultimate point of appeal for, and administrative investigation into, complaints made by members (and former members) of the Defence Forces against another member (or former member) of the Defence Forces, or against a civil servant of the Department of Defence. The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces may investigate a complaint in respect of an action or decision, which may have adversely affected the complainant personally. The action or decision complained of must have occurred no earlier than the 1st December 2005.</P>
        <P>To date, the office of the Ombudsman has sent me some seventy four Final Reports (74) reports.  In addition, the Ombudsman has sent me fifteen (15) Preliminary Views on cases for which the Final Report has not yet issued.  I have either responded to or am in the process of responding to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces in respect of each of the Final reports.  The Minister for Defence is obliged to inform the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces of the measures taken or proposed in response to her recommendation in each report.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations in these reports cover issues specific to the case in question including proposals for redress where the Ombudsman has found that a person has been wronged.  The reports may also include systemic matters that the Ombudsman has identified in her investigation of the case.  In arriving at my determination on each case I take careful account of all of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations. I also take into account the specific and unique requirements of the Defence Forces organisation.  I refer recommendations of a systemic nature to the appropriate Branches of my Department and of the Defence Forces for consideration in their ongoing development of best practice human resource management.</P>
        <P>The input of the Ombudsman has already assisted the Defence Forces in the revision of a number of HR procedures, including the selection processes for career courses and overseas service.  The recommendations in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s reports to me have also impacted on the revision of selection processes for promotion. A new version of the promotional selection system for enlisted personnel is currently being progressed with the Representative Associations through the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 460 and 461 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decision on decentralisation provides for the transfer of my Department&rsquo;s Dublin-based civil service staff, together with a number of military personnel, to Newbridge, Co. Kildare and for the decentralisation of the Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) to the Curragh. The number of posts to be relocated to Newbridge is approximately 200 civil servants and 43 military personnel. A further 410 military personnel will decentralise to the Curragh.</P>
        <P>Site acquisition, building construction and fit-out costs are borne on the Vote of the Office of Public Works.  No non-property costs have been incurred by my Department to date.  No property has been bought or rented by my Department outside Dublin under the scheme.</P>
        <P>Close to 90% of clerical/administrative staff are now in place in preparation for the move to Newbridge.  No members of staff have moved to date pending availability of the new accommodation at Station Road, Newbridge.  Construction of the building commenced in June 2008 and OPW have advised that it is expected to be completed by December 2009.</P>
        <P>The decentralisation of DFHQ to the Curragh is among those approved for continuation in Budget 2009.  A State owned site for the new building has been identified in the Curragh.  The timescale for completion of the project will be determined by the outcome of the proposed tender competition that is currently being prepared by OPW.  It is expected that tenders will be invited before the end of the year.</P>

	<P>Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel is primarily used by military aircraft, but occasionally civil aircraft are permitted to use the Aerodrome for, inter alia, the purpose of pilot training, familiarisation visits and landings of charter aircraft for Irish troop rotations.</P>
        <P>I am advised by military authorities that KC-135 aircraft have never used Casement Aerodrome.  However, I understand that KC-135 aircraft are similar in appearance to other aircraft such as the DC-8 cargo aircraft, which has recently landed at Baldonnel to facilitate a logistic re-supply flight to Chad.  It is possible that this aircraft was mistaken for a KC-135.</P>
        <P>These re-supply flights would normally depart in the early morning to avoid potential Air Traffic Control congestion over Europe during the day and I have also been informed that the criss-cross patterns referred to are most likely caused by high altitude commercial aircraft that cross over Ireland early in the morning en-route from the US to European destinations.  These &lsquo;contrails&rsquo; are not produced by low altitude aircraft.</P>

	<P>The use of all portable electronic devices in my Department and the Defence Forces is covered by comprehensive ICT security policies, which have been in force for some years. The policies have undergone recent review and are supplemented by additional instructions from time to time to reflect changing requirements and best industry practice. They are published and distributed to all staff and are available on internal Defence networks. In line with these policies, all newly issued laptops have full hard disk encryption prior to issue and this level of protection is also being rolled out to older models. All devices issued are registered, tracked and updated with increased levels of protection, as necessary, from time to time. I am satisfied that these measures provide robust means of protection for all personal or private data held on portable electronic devices.</P>

        <P>Regarding Ireland&rsquo;s participation in future Battlegroups, there has been some confusion arising from misinformed reporting in the media on the issue of our possible participation in the Austro/German Battlegroup.  As I have previously stated in the D&aacute;il we are currently examining the idea of contributing to both the Nordic Battlegroup (2011) and a new Austro/German Battlegroup (2012).  It is not a question of either/or and there is certainly <Col N="537"/>no question of us leaving the Nordic Battlegroup.  We are already committed in principle to participation in the Nordic Battlegroup (NBG) which will be on stand-by for the first six months of 2011. As with the Nordic Battlegroup in 2008 the other contributors to the Nordic Battlegroup are Sweden (acting as Framework Nation), Finland, Norway and Estonia.</P>
        <P>In addition, informal discussions have also taken place between staff in my Department and representatives from Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) regarding Ireland&rsquo;s possible participation in the proposed Austro/German Battlegroup. This Battlegroup will be on stand-by for the second six months of 2012.</P>
        <P>Government approval will be required before participation in either Battlegroup is finalised.</P>

	<P>As I indicated to the House last week during the debate on Budget 2009, it is important that the ongoing process of correction in the housing market is not artificially interfered with.  Given that sentiment in the housing market is heavily dependent on wider sentiment in the economy, the Government&rsquo;s approach is focused on the broader economic fundamentals and ensuring, ultimately, that the housing market is underpinned by these.</P>
        <P>Any housing-specific interventions must be targeted in nature and designed to achieve specific outcomes.  The announcement in the Budget of the introduction, for a limited period, of a new mortgage product for certain first-time buyers is fully in line with this policy.  It is designed to respond, in a targeted way, to a very specific set of circumstances in the housing market whereby prospective first-time buyers who would previously have been in a position to access mortgage finance from one of the financial institutions are not currently in a position to do so, due to the impacts of the credit crunch.  The initiative provides no incentive to enter the housing market; it will merely facilitate certain first-time buyers who have themselves decided to purchase a home.</P>

        <Quest> the position with regard to what has been identified in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 report as the very important contribution that private capital has made to the modernisation of Ireland&rsquo;s waste management infrastructure and the anticipation that further significant investment will be forthcoming during the currency of the plan; the proposals he is considering, in consultation with the Department of Finance in view of the recent economic crises in the banking and credit systems to provide incentives to the private sector in return for further capital funding in respect of the provision of waste management infrastructure; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I anticipate that the private sector will continue to invest in waste management infrastructure.  Therefore, I have no plans at present to consult with the Department of Finance to provide incentives to the private sector for the provision of such infrastructure.  The significant investment that has already taken place in waste infrastructure by the private sector demonstrates <Col N="540"/>that such activities are generally profitable and thus do not require additional incentives.  Furthermore any attempt to introduce such incentives could contravene EU rules on State Aid. </P>
        <P>Statutory responsibility for the making and implementation of regional waste management plans, including the provision of infrastructure, rests with the local authority, or local authorities, concerned.</P>
        <P>An objective of the National Development Plan is to continue to support local authority provision of infrastructure that will maximise the value recovered in waste recycling.  Therefore, funding on waste management infrastructure by my Department is being prioritised to support the provision of infrastructure such as recycling facilities by local authorities which the private sector would not normally provide.</P>

	<P>A person occupying a house under the shared ownership scheme has the right to buy out the local authority&rsquo;s share and acquire full ownership at any time.  Alternatively, this may be done by purchasing, from time to time, additional shares of the authority&rsquo;s equity.  The cost of purchasing an additional share or the redemption value of the outstanding share, for transactions commenced from 1 January 2003, is based on its initial cost adjusted annually to compensate for differences between the rent paid on the local authority&rsquo;s share and the interest calculated by reference to the prevailing interest rates.  The same calculation methodology is utilised in the event that the owner of a house purchased through shared ownership wishes to sell the house on the open market. </P>
        <P>The terms of individual shared ownership transactions are governed by the provisions of the lease entered into between the purchaser and the housing authority in each case.</P>

	<P>Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Failure to do so is an offence, subject, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000, or a term of six months in prison or both and &euro;250 for each day of a continuing offence. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department. </P>
        <P>In line with the commitment in Towards 2016 to update these minimum standards, work is nearing completion on a package of measures to deliver on this objective. Higher standards will be introduced for sanitary and cooking facilities, heating, ventilation and lighting. Provisions in <Col N="541"/>respect of fire safety and refuse facilities will be included in this package and I expect proposals in this regard to be submitted to Government shortly, with the associated regulations being made thereafter.</P>
        <P>A number of specific elements of the package will require primary legislation and will be addressed in the context of the passage through the Oireachtas of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008. These include increased penalties for non-compliance and the introduction of a more robust sanctions regime.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have significantly expanded their inspection regimes in recent years. Over 14,000 inspections of rental accommodation were reported by local authorities in 2007, representing an increase of 42% on the corresponding figure for 2006. More detailed information on the number of inspections carried out each year up to and including 2007 is included in my Department&rsquo;s Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.</P>
        <P>My Department provides significant resources, from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, to assist local authorities in discharging their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to rented accommodation. Over &euro;9m has been provided to local authorities for this purpose since 2004. Funding is increasingly being related to inspection performance. Half of the funding paid in respect of 2007 was based on actual inspections carried out and this will also be the case in respect of 2008. I have no doubt that the significantly increased funding being made available to local authorities for inspection activity, and the manner in which I am increasingly linking funding allocations to actual inspections carried out, have contributed to the improved performance.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide on the specific details of its inspection arrangements. However, in discharging their responsibilities in relation to the rental sector, authorities have been asked to have regard to the report &mdash; Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement &mdash; published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which makes a range of recommendations on matters relevant to inspection procedures such as identifying and targeting inspection requirements.</P>

	<P>Since the enactment of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act in 1998, local authorities have adopted two successive Traveller accommodation programmes. In the course of the first programmes, covering the five-year period 2000 to 2004, some 1,371 additional Traveller families were provided with permanent, secure accommodation. This included some 586 units of Traveller-specific accommodation including halting sites and group housing. Over the same period there was a 50% reduction in the number of families living on unauthorised sites, down from 1,207 at the start of the programmes to 601 families at their completion.</P><Col N="543"/>
        <P>Significant progress is being made under the second Traveller accommodation programmes, covering the four-year period 2005 to 2008. At end 2007, some 1,156 additional units of accommodation were provided, of which 297 were Traveller-specific.</P>
        <P>The most recent annual count of Traveller families, taken in November 2007, showed a total of 8,099 families nationally, an increase of 42% since the first Traveller accommodation programmes began in 2000. The number of Traveller families living on unauthorised sites in November 2007 was 594. This includes 364 families located on un-serviced sites on the roadside, in private gardens/fields or other property.</P>

	<P>The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal currently applies in 16 urban areas nationally.

        <P>The question of extending the areas subject to smokeless fuels regulations has been, and continues to be, kept under review in consultation with local authorities and having regard to the need to ensure good air quality.  Monitoring at permanent and mobile monitoring stations by the EPA and local authorities confirms that air quality in Ireland is good.  The question of the need to extend the air quality monitoring network to cover additional urban areas due to population changes has been raised with the EPA in the context of an overall monitoring review which has been requested by my Department as part of the Programme for Government commitment on monitoring air quality. I expect the EPA will conclude this review by year end.</P>

	<P>Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) are formally designated by Statutory Instrument under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000. Proposed NHAs (pNHAs), have yet to be legally designated and as such are not protected under the Wildlife Acts. However, they may be afforded some protection under the Planning and Development Acts where their ecological value is recognised in the Development Plan of the relevant planning authority.</P>
        <P>Proposed restrictions on pNHAs under the Wildlife Acts will vary depending on the habitat type, species or geological feature to be protected. Some pNHAs are very small in area, such as a roosting place. Others are large such as a blanket bog or lake. Several hundred sites are currently proposed for designation as NHAs countrywide.  These sites include a very diverse range of habitats, animals and plants.</P>

        <Quest> further to a previous parliamentary question (details supplied), his views on whether both the 25% and the 28% reductions are significantly lower than the 42% figure for renewable generation and that this is as a result of diminishing returns and reflects reduced efficiency in the fossil fuel generating sector as wind is added to the grid; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The modelling work employed in the &ldquo;All Island Grid Study&rdquo; applied a series of assumptions to the six portfolios examined. The study took portfolio 1, which includes 16% renewable electricity in 2020, as the reference case to assess the performance of the other portfolios. In the case of portfolio 5, which examines a 42% share of renewable generation capacity in 2020, the estimated savings in emissions and reduction in gas imports are the additional savings achievable over and above the savings delivered by Portfolio 1 as the reference case. The figures of 25% reduction in emissions savings and 28% reduction in gas used for electricity generation postulated in the Grid Study reflect the comparative difference between 42% renewable capacity on the system in 2020 and 16% renewable capacity on the system in 2020. The absolute reductions in emissions and gas for 42% renewable capacity (i.e. by reference to zero renewable capacity) would accordingly be higher than 25% and 28% respectively.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A study has been commissioned to rework the findings of the All-Island Electricity Grid Study to take specific account of potential Demand Side Management measures. The study is part of an agreed programme of out-working a range of aspects of the Grid Study. The study has been commissioned jointly by my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and the contract has recently been awarded to independent international consultants, Ecofys.  The study, which will cost &euro;74,200 (excluding VAT), is expected to be completed in the first quarter 2009 and the intention is to publish the report, jointly with Northern Ireland, as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

	<P>My Department has not conducted direct studies or computer modelling of the electricity market in 2008, nor are there any planned for 2009. In the performance of its statutory functions including in relation to the Single Electricity Market (SEM), the Commission for Energy Regulation undertake various studies and modelling tasks on the electricity market. I am advised that the Commission jointly with the Northern Ireland Regulator is currently modelling the effect of the incorporation of increased levels of wind power in the SEM. It is expected that this study will be finalised before the end of the year. The cost of this work is a day to day operational matter for the Commission, which is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions.</P>
        <P>My Department currently makes a contribution towards the overall running costs of the ESRI&rsquo;s Energy Policy Research Centre which conducts a range of research relevant to energy policy under its annual work programme. This research programme has included in previous years simulation modelling of the Irish electricity system and analysis of interconnection and energy efficiency. I am advised that future work of the Centre in this area includes the cost of <Col N="550"/>renewables integration into the electricity system and the development of a dynamic model of power generation to inform consideration of appropriate electricity generation investment for Ireland.</P>

	<P>The Community Support Scheme, amounting to &euro;5 million, has been made available to those affected by the cessation of the mixed stock salmon fishery through the implementing bodies viz. 15 LEADER companies and Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann, in respect of island communities and Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta Teoranta, in respect of the Gaeltacht areas. The scheme is primarily targeted at those communities where commercial salmon fishing has been a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacts on the economic and social fabric of the area. Initiatives which may be considered for funding include retraining of the labour force previously employed in the mixed stock fishery, diversification into non-salmon fishing activity and projects to promote the quality of the local environment. As the focus of the scheme is on diversification from salmon fishery activity, grant aid is not provided for measures that will promote such activity. In addition, under current EU State Aid Guidelines, grant aid for the construction of fishing vessels and funding for any aspect of a fishing operation that will increase fishing effort are prohibited. Such proposals cannot therefore be considered for funding under the Community Support Scheme or any other Government funded scheme.</P>

	<P>The vast majority of property related costs in relation to decentralisation have been paid directly by the Office of Public Works (OPW). Earlier this year the Department agreed a short term rental of storage facilities in Cavan and costs to date in 2008 are &euro;3200. The total non-property costs incurred by the Department in respect of the decentralisation programme since 2003 and reported to date to the Department of Finance are &euro;104,538. This expenditure relates to advance moves of functions and staff resources to Cavan and Clonakilty. The majority of costs relate to the relocation of the entire seafood functions to Clonakilty and, as the Deputy will be aware, subsequent to the relocation to Clonakilty being completed, these functions were transferred to the now Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Food.</P>

	<P>The Decentralisation Programme as originally announced in December 2003 included the proposal <Col N="551"/>to relocate the Headquarters of my Department in its entirety to Cavan Town. This involved the relocation of approximately 300 Civil Service posts. A total of 56 staff members from my Department have relocated to interim accommodation in Cavan Town to date. This interim accommodation was arranged by the Office of Public Works who are responsible for property issues under the decentralisation programme. My Department separately rents a small storage area in Cavan. The Government has recently announced that the decentralisation of the rest of my Department to Cavan is deferred pending a review in 2011.</P>

	<P>EirGrid launched its grid development strategy, Grid25, on 8 October 2008. The Strategy sets out a roadmap for the development of the electricity transmission network for the next seventeen years and aims to double the capacity of the national grid during this period. This increase in capacity is required to meet the projected increase in electricity demand over that period, and to support economic development throughout the regions by making available a secure, reliable, efficient and economical energy supply. The expansion of the grid will also enable the integration of renewable energy, in line with EU renewable energy and climate change targets as well as the Government&rsquo;s recently announced increased target of 40% electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Enhanced interconnectivity with the UK, and in due course with mainland Europe, will also contribute fundamentally to security of supply and Ireland&rsquo;s integration in the European energy Market.</P>
        <P>EirGrid&rsquo;s statement of its mission reflects its mandate under statute to carry out the role of the independent electricity transmission system and market operator. EirGrid is funded through electricity use of system charges overseen by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and its core activities are to develop and maintain the grid infrastructure, to balance supply and demand for electricity on a national basis through the national control centre, and <Col N="552"/>to operate, in conjunction with SONI (the Northern Ireland transmission system operator) the Single Electricity Market. In its role as transmission system and market operator, EirGrid produces an annual Generation Adequacy Report which sets out forecasts for electricity demand over a period of 7 years, and assesses the projected availability of generation and interconnector capacity in place or being developed to meet this demand. The CER also has statutory functions and powers in relation to ensuring security of electricity supply and works with EirGrid and generators to facilitate optimum availability of generating capacity and the operation of the transmission and distribution system.</P>
        <P>Working with the CER, EirGrid&rsquo;s approach to the development and operation of the transmission system, is fully in line with the Government&rsquo;s energy policy objectives. The collective task is to ensure sufficient generation and transmission capacity to meet Ireland&rsquo;s present and future energy needs, underpinning our transition to a low-carbon economy, and ensuring security of electricity supply and sustainability competitiveness.</P>

        <P>I do not have statutory responsibility to impose any particular measures across the public service in relation to the data stored on laptops, blackberries and other portable devices. In relation to my own Department, it employs layered network defences including intrusion detection systems, multiple firewalls, web content filtering, anti-virus, anti-spyware and anti-spam devices to block dangerous traffic and protect all information on the computer network. Blackberry devices are by default encrypted devices, with access protected by a password, and my Department has the capability to remotely wipe any devices that are reported missing. The low level of personal data held and processed within my Department informed a decision that there was no need to automatically encrypt all laptops used, as it was considered that the level of risk of losing personal data was very slight. My Department carries out a full independent audit of all computer systems each year and one is scheduled to be carried out before the end of the year. Any recommendations that are made to further secure the computers and data held by my Department will be implemented.</P>

	<P>The Single Payment Scheme application for the person named has been fully processed and any payment due will issue shortly. In addition the person named submitted an application under Category A of the 2008 National Reserve. Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May, 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000 to 2002.

	<P>While under the EU regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme, the earliest date payments may issue is 1 December of the scheme-year concerned, provision is also made for payments to be made earlier, subject to EU approval. Prompted by the very wet summer, which seriously affected farming, I approached the Agriculture Commissioner seeking agreement to an early advance 50% payment, in line with arrangements agreed for the 2007 scheme. I am pleased to say that the necessary approval was readily forthcoming and payments began to issue on 16 October, the first day of the new EU financial year. An application under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme, which was received from the person named on 6 May 2008, has now been processed and the 50% advance payment of &euro;6,008.29 issued on 20 October.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the Lost at Sea Scheme was to enable qualifying applicants, who were otherwise unable to do so for financial or related reasons, to provide replacement capacity for the purposes of introducing a replacement vessel in respect of fishing boats lost at sea between 1980 and the establishment of the fishing boat register in 1990, in order to continue a family tradition of sea-fishing.</P>
        <P>The terms of the Lost at Sea Scheme have always required and continue to require that the non-tradable (i.e. cannot be sold or realised as a financial asset in the tonnage market) capacity granted under the scheme must be used for the purposes of introducing a replacement boat for the lost vessel, which is owned and skippered by the applicant or by an immediate relation of the applicant. These terms were accepted in writing by all the applicants approved under the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, established under the provisions of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, is Ireland&rsquo;s competent independent authority for Seafood Safety and Sea-Fisheries Protection and has responsibility for the continuous monitoring, control and enforcement of sea fisheries regulations.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the progress made by his Department on implementing the decentralisation scheme, including the number of staff who have moved under the scheme and the property bought or rented outside Dublin under the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[35562/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The original Government decision on the decentralisation of my Department was that 600 headquarters staff would move to Portlaoise; some 100 staff in the local offices in Cork city would move to Fermoy; and up to 100 staff in the laboratories in Cork and Limerick would move to Macroom. Fisheries joined the Department in 2007 and the move of that function of my Department to Clonakilty is now substantially complete with 84 staff having moved there since the programme began. The decision regarding state agencies was that Bord Bia would move to Enniscorthy and Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) would move to Clonakilty.</P>
        <P>Following the decentralisation announcement in the Budget 2009, the moves to Portlaoise and Clonakilty (including BIM) were approved by Government to proceed. The moves to Fermoy, Macroom and Enniscorthy have been deferred pending a review in 2011.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s original Decentralisation Implementation Plan allowed for a phased move to Portlaoise and the 2005, 2006 and 2007 advance phases of decentralisation to Portlaoise were <Col N="559"/>completed on schedule. To date, the Department has met its targets as set out in its original plan and in total, since the programme was announced, there has been an increase of 297 full-time posts in Portlaoise bringing the total number there to almost 500.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) announced last December that a consortium, the Macquarie Partnership, has won the tender for the project to build the permanent offices in Portlaoise (as part of a public private partnership including offices in Mullingar and Carlow) and planning permission for the new building has now been granted. A revision to the Department&rsquo;s Decentralisation Implementation Plan is now being considered, to reflect the changes to the timetable and the progress so far, as well as the evolving operating environment. An additional advance phase has been agreed and planning and preparations for this phase are currently underway.</P>
        <P>The acquisition of property for the decentralisation programme is dealt with primarily by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and they have supplied the following details of the site acquisition at the two locations.</P>

        <Quest> if, regarding an application by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for disposal at sea of dredge material from maintenance dredging at Rosslare Europort, full account will be taken in the decision making process of the undertaking by CI&Eacute; to ensure that a minimum of three feet of water is consistently maintained at low tide in the lagoon and of a survey commissioned by an association (details supplied) which is at odds with the survey commissioned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The application by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for a Dumping At Sea permit to facilitate disposal at sea of dredge material arising from maintenance dredging is being processed by my Department.  In accordance with standard procedures, the application was referred to the Marine Licence Vetting Committee (MLVC) for examination.</P><Col N="562"/>
        <P>The MLVC has indicated that it is of the view that the proposed dredging of sand at the eastern side of the main east breakwater at the port would not have a significant negative impact on the marine environment and other legitimate users of the area and that the proposed disposal of the material in the near shore zone at Rosslare Strand would represent a beneficial re-use of this material as it would contribute to the re-nourishment of Rosslare Strand which is undergoing erosion.</P>
        <P>The available scientific evidence indicates that the net movement of sediments in the area of the proposed disposal site is towards the north and thus the disposal of material at the proposed site will have a minimal impact on the sediment accumulation in the lagoon. The dredging and disposal of the spoil will not, however, prevent sediment accumulation in the lagoon as the scientific evidence indicates that origin of this material is from the south.</P>
        <P>A final determination on the application will be made as soon as possible.</P>

        <Quest> if, in view of the difficult weather conditions in 2008 and the consequently increased consumption of compound feeds by animals on farms, he will review the regulations regarding permissible levels of phosphates and potash allowed to be spread on farm holdings; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The requirements in relation to phosphorus are set out in the Nitrates Regulations introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2006 (SI No. 378 of 2006). The Regulations set maximum limits on the application of fertilisers containing nitrogen and phosphorus and require a farmer to take account of the phosphorus content of any concentrated feedstuffs fed to grazing livestock on the holding in calculating the maximum amount of phosphorus that may be applied on that holding in a given year. While the usage of feedstuffs may have increased as a result of the recent bad weather, the sales of fertilisers containing phosphorus are significantly reduced this year with the result that abiding by the maximum fertilisation rates should be easier for farmers.</P>
        <P>The overall objective of the Regulations is to protect water quality and these provisions are designed to control the application of fertilisers, including the timing, method and maximum amounts that may be applied, in order to prevent fertiliser losses to water. The contents of the Regulations, including the maximum fertilisation rates and method of calculation, were the subject of extensive consultation with stakeholders, including the farming bodies, and were finalised following a long period of negotiation with the EU Commission.  I am informed that there are no plans to review the maximum fertilisation rates.</P>

Mid-year statements have also been provided as a service to farmers to assist them in calculating N&amp;P production on their holdings and to enable them to take appropriate steps if they appear likely to exceed the maximum of limit of 170 kg per <Col N="563"/>hectare of nitrogen from livestock manure per year as required under the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 (SI no. 378 of 2006).</P>

	<P>The Seafood Development Operational Programme which was adopted by the EU Commission on the 9th September 2008 was allocated &euro;42.26 million of European Fisheries Funds for the period 2007-2013. This Operational Programme will only involve schemes which are co-funded by EFF monies. Following intense negotiations between Department and the EU Commission these co-funded monies were allocated in the main to the decommissioning scheme which was identified as a priority by the Cawley Strategy, Steering A New Course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Aquaculture development will be supported by exchequer funding for the 2007-2013 period.  The estimates for 2009 has set aside &euro;5 million to support aquaculture development.  In addition support is provided to the sector by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>

	<P>The aquaculture licensing function is dealt with by the Coastal Zone Management Division of the Department which is headed by a Principal Officer.</P><Col N="567"/>
        <P>There is a substantial backlog in licence applications at present.  This is due in large measure to the fact that many of the existing licences were granted for a period of 10 years on foot of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 and are therefore falling due for renewal at present. In addition, many of the outstanding aquaculture licence applications are located in Natura 2000 sites.</P>
        <P>My Department is working actively with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the European Commission to develop a methodology acceptable to the Commission to enable these aquaculture licences to be renewed in compliance with the Habitats and Birds Directives. A sum of &euro;1.4m has been set aside in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Vote for 2009, to assist environmental compliance activities in relation to aquaculture and sea fishing activities in Natura 2000 sites.</P>
        <P>Reaching early agreement with the Commission on how to enable licence renewals in Natura 2000 sites in compliance with the Birds and Habitats Directives will greatly assist reducing the backlog of aquaculture licence renewals.</P>
        <P>The application process has become increasingly complex since the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 was enacted and involves a range of intermediate measures before a recommendation and decision can be made in any one case</P>
        <P>My Department is endeavouring as a matter of priority, to allocate on a temporary basis additional resources, to address the requirements to meet the demand which is peaking for renewal of the licences issued ten years ago.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that licensees awaiting determinations on renewal of their licences continue to enjoy the protection of their licences until such time as determinations are made and therefore can continue to work their aquaculture sites.</P>

	<P>Ireland supports generally initiatives brought forward at EU level in relation to the development of the aquaculture sector.  Each individual initiative is examined carefully and a broad view is taken on deciding our position.  While we are generally supportive of many of the provisions in the French paper on aquaculture, some aspects were not in line with Ireland&rsquo;s policy position in relation to the sector, specifically we are not prepared to commit to state coverage for risks associated with climate, natural disasters and health issues for the sector.  We consider that the industry itself must carry these risks, except in the most exceptional circumstances, which would be considered on a case by case basis.   </P>
        <P Just="Left">The blueprint for the development of the Irish aquaculture sector is set out in the Cawley Report (Steering a New Course) where aquaculture is recognised as an important element in delivering a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant seafood industry.

	<P>My Department does not have a role in setting prices at meat processing plants.  The Sheep Strategy Development Group recommended the introduction of a quality based pricing system and I understand this is currently under discussion between processor and producer representatives.  Efforts to increase rewards for better quality animals include trials on mechanical grading which were facilitated by my Department.  The results of these trials are being assessed at the moment. </P>
        <P>I would hope that a transparent grid for pricing can be agreed between the processors and suppliers in the near future.  Such a development would ultimately help suppliers to tailor their supply to the requirements of the marketplace and increase the returns available for better quality product.</P>

The issue was debated in detail by the Dail last week and all farmers holding a valid scheme approval were urged to note that the deadline of 31 December 2008 will not be changed. </P>

Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>An independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing, including developing school post, in primary schools.  Details of the appeal procedure are outlined in the staffing schedule and also in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The first meeting of the Appeal board was held in May 2008.  A further meeting will be held on 28th October.</P>
        <P>The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 565 and 570 together.</P>
        <P>The halls referred to by the Deputies were built as part of a programme to develop community sports halls in drugs task force areas in Dublin and Cork.  The stated objective of the programme was that each hall would be dual use in nature in that they would be accessible to the wider community as well as to the local school population.  The intention was that, apart from normal school usage, the facilities would be available as much as possible to the community and, in particular, to target groups such as youth at risk.</P>
        <P>An application was made by my Department in 2006 for dormant accounts funding to enable community usage of the halls to commence.  Government approval was received in 2007 for the drawdown of funding of approximately &euro;2.1 million in respect of six of the halls, including those referred to by the Deputies.  In regard to these six halls, management structures were put in place and community groups were given access.</P>
        <P>The position is that the allocated dormant accounts funding will provide for the operation of these halls until the end of 2008.  My Department does not fund community facilities but we are in contact with other Departments with responsibilities in this area and will be in contact with the relevant stakeholders as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware the Programme for Government commits my Department to establishing a Developing Areas Unit to identify where new schools are needed and to ensure that these schools are delivered in the fastest possible timeframe. </P>
        <P>The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.  Liaison with existing schools is also an important part of the process.  In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision and that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity or provide new infrastructure where necessary.</P>
        <P>In addition, Local Authorities are obliged by statute to refer draft local area development plans to the Department for observation and comment so that lands can be zoned for future education use.  There are numerous sites reserved for education purposes, particularly in the rapidly developing areas, under this process so as to ensure that there will be sufficient land set aside and available for the future development of education infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Over and above the statutory consultation provisions in relation to local authority draft area development plans, my Department has in recent years worked to strengthen contacts with local authorities to enable informed decisions to be made in planning future educational provision.</P>
        <P>My Department also makes extensive use of data from the Census of Population for a variety of purposes including long-term projections of enrolment at national and local level.  The census results for 2006 are of use in identifying broad trends in total population by county and local area.  My Department also uses census data when drafting its own area development plans and planning school provision for likely enrolment at local area level.</P><Col N="575"/>
        <P>My Department is satisfied that the approach which it is now taking to the identification and delivery of extra school places in rapidly developing areas will help to ensure that those places will be provided when and where they are needed.</P>
        <P>The specific areas which were targeted in 2008 by the Developing Areas Unit are as follows. Ashbourne, Athlone, Athy, Balbriggan, Belmayne, Carlow Town, Carrigaline,   Celbridge, Doughiska, Drogheda, Duleek, Dunboyne, Dundalk, Enniscorthy, Gorey, Greystones, Kilcock, Kill, Kinnegad, Lucan, Lusk, Maynooth, Midleton,  Mullingar, Naas, Newbridge, Newcastle, Phoenix Park, Portlaoise, Ratoath,  Saggart, Skerries, Swords, Rochestown, Tallaght, Tramore, Trim and Tullamore.</P>

	<P>The Centre for Early Childhood Development (CECDE) was established in 2002 as part of the implementation of Ready to Learn, the White Paper on Early Childhood Education (1999).  It was sanctioned initially for a 3 year period.  This was extended for a further 3 years in 2005.  The original remit of the Centre included the development of a Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education. This was successfully delivered in 2006 with the publication of S&iacute;olta.  Since the CECDE had effectively delivered on its remit and its sanction was ending in 2008, it presented an opportune time to look at the structures that should be put in place to move to the next phase.  With the cessation of the CECDE, this next phase will be led by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  It is envisaged that 2 CECDE staff will be contracted to work within the OMCYA structure in the area of Early Years Education Policy.</P>

	<P>The Centre for Early Childhood Development (CECDE) was established in 2002 as part of the implementation of Ready to Learn, the White Paper on Early Childhood Education (1999).  It was sanctioned initially for a 3 year period.  This was extended for a further 3 years in 2005.  The original remit of the Centre included the development of a Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education.  This was successfully delivered in 2006 with the publication of S&iacute;olta.   Since the CECDE had effectively delivered on its remit and its sanction was ending in 2008, it presented an opportune time to look at the structures that should be put in place to move to the next phase.   The establishment of the Centre had predated the establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children, now the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  This Office brings together policy makers from different Government Departments to ensure consistency in policy-making and policy implementation for children and is, I consider well placed to progress quality provision in Early Childhood Care and Education.   While the CECDE will not be incorporated into my Department, it is envisaged that 2 CECDE staff will be contracted to work within the OMCYA structure in the area of Early Years Education Policy.</P>

	<P>Under the School Transport Scheme over 80% of the school buses used are privately owned, most of these being small and medium sized buses.  The number of Bus Eireann school buses in use fluctuates on a monthly basis as more modern buses are introduced and others are withdrawn from service on a continual basis throughout the School Year. However, Bus <Col N="579"/>Eireann use about 620 of their own buses to provide school transport each day, almost all of which are large capacity vehicles.</P>
        <P>Currently 18 Bus Eireann school buses, and 9 privately owned school buses under contract, are also used to provide one day a week rural transport services organised by Bus Eireann in the middle of the day between class times without impinging on the school transport timetable.  The cost of providing these services neither increases nor reduces the cost of school transport provided by my Department and in the same way the expanded use of school buses for this purpose would not impact on the cost of school transport provision.</P>

I can say, however, that it is inaccurate to suggest that the Department&rsquo;s contribution will be limited to 25%.  The DDDA&rsquo;s offer has a ceiling and the percentage value of that will not be known until the project is actually tendered.  The offer is, however, both significant and welcome.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s Professional and Technical staff is currently nearing completion of its review of the Stage One submission for the project.  When completed, the next step will be to discuss its findings with the Board of Management.  Once this review is finalised, my officials will arrange this discussion.</P>

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.

        <P>There is no early retirement scheme in operation for Civil Servants whereby retirees are approved for added years or enhanced pensions on retirement prior to the date of their preserved pension age, nor has there been such a scheme in the past five years.

        <P>Under the terms of the Department of Finance Circular 10/2005, Public Service Pension Reform: Introduction of cost neutral early retirement, public servants have the option to retire up to ten years before preserved pension age, with immediate payment of superannuation benefits, subject to actuarial reduction to take account of the early payment of the lump sum and the linger period over which the pension would be paid. There is no additional cost to the state for the operation of this scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 605 and 606 together.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made in the last ten years in increasing the number of teachers in our primary schools.</P>
        <P>The number of teaching posts in primary schools in June 1997 was approximately 21,000.  The number in September, 2008 is over 31,000 which is an increase of over 10,000.</P>
        <P>The average primary class size for the 2007/08 school year was 23.9 down from 26.6 in 1996/97.  The pupil teacher ratio &mdash; which includes resource teachers etc.- was 16:1 compared to 22.2 in the 1996/97 school year.</P>
        <P>In the 2006/07 year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. This represented a decrease in the overall class size by reference to the staffing schedule from 35:1 in the 1995/96 school year to 28:1 in the 2006/07 school year.</P>
        <P>Given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult choices have to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  Tax revenues are down significantly and Government expenditure has to reflect this reality.   These decisions included an increase in the enrolment bands of the staffing schedule for the allocation of teachers in primary schools from an average of one teacher for 27 pupils to an average of one teacher for 28 pupils. DEIS schools will continue to benefit from lower class sizes.</P>
        <P>The most recent Irish data on class sizes shows average class sizes for 2007/08 at 23.9 pupils. The most recent published statistics for the OECD average class size is 21.5 pupils. While I recognise the importance of class sizes it must also be noted that many other issues such as the quality of our teachers impact on the standard of education in our schools. We will continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our schools to ensure that the best possible outcomes for our children are achieved.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the discrepancies between the ability of primary school communities in middle income areas and disadvantaged areas to raise funds voluntarily in order to ensure that the basic running costs of schools are met; if, regardless of the socio-economic profiles of primary <Col N="588"/>schools, the Government has failed to provide adequate funding through the capitation grant for primary schools here and that the recent failure to increase the capitation grant in budget 2009 from &euro;178 to &euro;356 per pupil is further evidence of this; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall level of funding for primary schools which will see funding increase from &euro;167 million in 2008 to almost &euro;190 million in 2009.  The primary capitation grant has been improved by more than &euro;21 to bring the rate to &euro;200 per pupil.  The ancillary services grant for primary schools will also be improved by &euro;3.50 to &euro;155 per pupil.</P>
        <P>Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full ancillary services grant will get &euro;355 per pupil &mdash; or almost &euro;25 extra &mdash; in this school year to cover their day to day running costs, with a primary school of 300 pupils getting &euro;7,475 more. In 2000, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than &euro;40,000 to meet its day to day running costs. That same school under these new rates will receive &euro;106,500.  This excludes the salary of teachers and Special Needs Assistants which are paid by the Department.</P>
        <P>Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from &euro;512 to &euro;986 per pupil &mdash; an increase of 59% from the rate in 2006.</P>
        <P>In addition, in the order of &euro;14 million of grant assistance will issue to some 2,570 primary schools this November in respect of the 2008/2009 school year to assist them with their respective levels of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>By any standards there have been very significant improvements within a relatively short period of time and the Government is committed to further increasing funding for schools as resources permit.</P>

	<P>The Universities Act (Section 52),1997 and the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999 prohibit the use of the terms &lsquo;University&rsquo;, &lsquo;Institute of Technology&rsquo; or &lsquo;Regional Technical College&rsquo; where the organisation is also engaged in the provision of education services unless the Minister for  Education consents to the use of the term. The organisations referred to by the Deputy do not use the terms &lsquo;University&rsquo;, &lsquo;Institute of Technology&rsquo; or &lsquo;Regional Technical College&rsquo; in their titles.</P>
        <P>In Ireland we have a national framework of qualifications which enables providers in public, private, workplace or community settings to offer recognised awards in further or higher education, in compliance with the processes set out by the Further Education and Training Awards Council or the Higher Education and Training Awards Council. Such providers must agree their quality assurance arrangements with the relevant awards council, and satisfy the council <Col N="589"/>that the awards are of an appropriate standard, the necessary supports are in place for learners and the assessment arrangements are fair and consistent. There are also procedures under which international or professional bodies may seek to have their programmes aligned with or included in the national framework of qualifications in Ireland, if they wish to do so. My Department is also bound by the Lisbon Convention and the EU Directive on Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications to give appropriate recognition to nationally accredited awards from other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>In addition to this, the Department maintains an Internationalisation Register containing programmes which are approved for the purpose of access to work by students who are citizens from outside the EU/EEA and Switzerland. Only programmes which have been quality assured and/or lead to recognised qualifications are included on the Register. Both the Internationalisation Register and a list of approved higher education providers are maintained on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The organisation referred to by the Deputy is not included on the Internationalisation Register, and does not currently offer programmes recognised by FETAC or HETAC under the national framework of qualifications.</P>
        <P>Learners are advised to carefully review the accreditation of any intended course of study before paying fees or beginning a programme.  The Government intends to take a number of steps to bring greater clarity and focus to the promotion of Irish educational programmes overseas.  This will include the development and implementation of a Quality Mark for international education programmes, the award of which will be based on appropriate  certification of educational programmes and implementation by institutions of a Code of Practice for the delivery of international education services.</P>

	<P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the recent letter from Senator O&rsquo;Toole to the Comptroller and Auditor General proposing a Value for Money review of the Planning and Building Unit of my Department. My Department always extends full co-operation to the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff, who regularly carry out reviews of aspects of the operation of the of the Planning and Building Unit.</P>
        <P>As I indicated in the Seanad debate on the matter on 8th October 2008, I do not share Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s view of the Planning and Building Unit of my Department and I do not accept the basic thrust of his criticisms. My Department has made substantial progress in improving school infrastructure over the last several years and I intend that this will continue in the context of the funding available under the National Development Plan.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 611 and 612 together.</P>
        <P>As part of any application for major capital works, my Department assesses the long term projected enrolment of a school. Where a project is being considered for imminent inclusion on the School Building and Modernisation programme, a site visit is often organised in order to inform the final brief for the project and to determine the capacity of the site for the required works and the configuration which those works might take on the site.</P>
        <P>Currently there are over 360 major projects in architectural planning.  Normal procedure is to organise a site visit as part of this process.  The details of these visits and the reports generated from them are held on individual project files in my Department.</P>
        <P>In addition, there are over 1000 applications on hand in my Department for major capital works. Most of these will also require site visits at the appropriate time before they can be included in the School Building and Modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>Given the number of projects involved it would require an inordinate amount of staff time to assemble the requested information. However, if the Deputy wishes to clarify the situation in respect of individual cases then I would be happy to provide him with the information.</P>

	<P>Early retirement schemes are not generally available in organisations under the aegis of my Department. However, in part<Col N="592"/>icular circumstances arising in two such organisations, early retirement was availed of by 7 staff over the past 3 years.</P>
        <P>St Catherine&rsquo;s College of Education in Home Economics closed on 31 August 2007.  The decision to close St. Catherine&rsquo;s was made following consideration of the future of the College arising from notification by the Trustees of the College that they were not in a position to continue their role into the future. Prior to its closure, the Department of Education and Science provided the majority of the College&rsquo;s funding. Early retirement was offered as part of a range of options (the others being redundancy or redeployment) that were put in place for the permanent staff of the College specifically for the closure. The terms of the early retirement scheme offered to staff were equivalent to Strand 3 early retirement for teachers. Of the total of 20 permanent staff who were still employed by the College in 2007, six individuals availed of the early retirement package. The grades of those who accepted early retirement under this scheme were President of the College (2008), 4 Lecturers (2007) and 1 Librarian (2007). The ages of the staff concerned range from 47 to 61.</P>
        <P>In the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), 1 member of staff has been approved for early retirement in the past 3 years. The NEWB was established in 2002. At the time of transfer of personnel from the School Attendance Service to the Board, the Labour Court recommended that 8 places be made available for Voluntary Early Retirement (VER) for eligible personnel who did not wish to transfer to the new service and 7 applicants were approved for the scheme.</P>
        <P>One applicant for the VER was not eligible at that time on age grounds and subsequently made an application when the age grounds were met. This application was rejected by the NEWB. However, a Labour Court Hearing upheld the application for VER in view of the one remaining position for VER which had not been utilised. The Board received sanction from the Department of Finance to implement the decision of the court, conditional on a written commitment from the Union involved that no consequential claims would be made for  additional VER and that the cost would be met from within the resources of the Board. The staff member concerned retired on 5th October 2007, aged 51 years.  There is no current VER scheme in operation by the NEWB.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Redress Board&rsquo;s primary function is to provide financial redress to persons who, as children, were abused while resident in Industrial Schools, Reformatories or other institutions that were subject to State regulation or inspection.  The closing date for receipt of applications was the 15th December 2005 by which time the Board had received 14,513 applications. The Board has received a total of 14,549 applications (including 36 late applications accepted up to 31st December 2007).</P>
        <P>Up to 1st September 2008, 11,793 applications were processed by the Board.  The overall average award from the inception of the scheme is &euro;64,892.  Awards are determined by the Board having regard to the severity of the abuse, the severity of physical and psychological injury and the loss of opportunity resulting from the abuse.  The level of awards range in value from &euro;0 to &euro;300,000.</P><Col N="593"/>
        <P>Expenditure associated with the Redress Board to the end of 2007 was &euro;745,591,963.  Based on the total number of applications received, the final cost of the scheme may be in the region of &euro;1.1 billion, including legal and administration costs.  Any estimate of the final cost of the Scheme at this point will be tentative as the Board has approximately 2,756 applications to  process and the level of award provided in these remaining cases may vary substantially.</P>
        <P>With approximately 2,756 cases to be processed, it is difficult to say at this point when the Board will have completed its work. However, from experience, as the Board generally clears between 200 to 220 cases per month, an estimated timeframe is 14 months or towards the end of 2009.  While the processing of awards should be completed in 2009, there will be some residual work to be completed by the Board in 2010.</P>

        <Quest> the proportion of the &euro;128 million agreed with the religious orders for residential institution compensation that has been received to date; the amount outstanding; if he will provide details of what remains to be delivered and the timescale for delivery; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement reached with the Religious Congregations on 5 June 2002, the congregations agreed to make a contribution of &euro;128 million towards the cost of the Redress Scheme.  This sum was broken down as follows: Property Transfers, &euro;76.68 million; Cash Contribution, &euro;41.14 million; and Provision of Counselling Services, &euro;10 million.  In actual terms, whilst the overall figure of &euro;128 million has not altered, the form in which it has or is to be transferred to the State has altered somewhat in terms of the property and cash contributions.  The alterations to the agreed amounts have occurred where the State agreed to accept and has since received cash in lieu of properties to the value of &euro;10.76 million.  Hence, the breakdown of the practical implications of the Indemnity Agreement is as follows: Property Transfers, &euro;66.1 million; Cash Contribution, &euro;51.9 million; and Provision of Counselling Services, &euro;10 million.  I can confirm that the full cash contribution of &euro;51.9 million has been received, including that which was accepted in lieu of properties.  My Department has also received confirmation that the contributing congregations have provided counselling services to the value of &euro;10 million.</P>
        <P>As a result of the Indemnity Agreement, my Department agreed in principle with CORI that a total of 64 properties would be accepted, subject to good and marketable title and agreed valuations, towards meeting the &euro;66.1 million target.  Valuations of the individual properties are fully agreed and are fixed at 2002 values.  In relation to the properties transferring under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement, whilst a certain number have been fully accepted under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement, my Department continues to liaise with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office in securing the transfer of the remaining properties.  It should also be noted that whilst the legal transfers of a number of properties have not been finalised, the properties are in the possession of and being utilised by the recipients.  It is difficult to give any estimate of when the transfer of all 64 properties will be finalised as each transaction brings its own set of issues and, the transfer of property, by its very nature, is a complex and time-consuming process.  I assure the Deputy that officials in my Department are continuously working towards a full realisation of the terms of the Indemnity Agreement.</P>

	<P>Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  In accordance with the rules, each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.  It is a matter for the school to employ teachers up to the limit of its approved allocation and at its discretion to deploy those teachers to the subject areas that the school chooses to provide.  The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of male secondary school teachers who teach foreign language subjects in all-male secondary schools is not readily available within my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 623 to 648, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments, directly through my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments, which is administered and paid for by NEPS.  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the first table that follows this reply sets out the number of primary schools, by county, to which a NEPS psychologist was assigned, or which had access to the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments, in the past academic year.  Since the beginning of June, and predominantly since 1 September 2008, some 21 psychologists have been appointed to the NEPS service.  Each has been appointed to a specific NEPS office and will, following the requisite period of induction and work-shadowing, be assigned a full complement of schools.  It is intended that NEPS will assess the effect of the assignment of these new staff, in the context of national coverage, at the end of the first term of 2008-09, at which time an up-to-date county by county breakdown will be forwarded to the Deputy.  The second table that follows this reply also contains a breakdown of the number of assessments commissioned by primary schools under the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments in each county for 2006 and 2007.</P>

	<P>My Department is currently examining a number of possible projects for inclusion on its fast track programme for 2009.

The projects currently under consideration are in the following regions; the greater Dublin area, the south east and south.  It is my intention to make an announcement in the first quarter of 2009 on major primary and post-primary school projects to proceed to construction. </P>
