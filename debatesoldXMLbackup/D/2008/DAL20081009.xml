	<P>Anois, iarratais chun tairisceana a dh&eacute;anamh an D&aacute;il a chur ar athl&oacute; faoi Bhuan Ord&uacute; 32.  Now we come to deal with requests to move the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the threat to the economic viability of the farming industry as a result of the Government&rsquo;s refusal to extend the deadline for the farm waste management scheme beyond 31 December 2008 or to engage in constructive negotiations with the European Commission, despite the fact that such a refusal will destroy the livelihoods of farmers, which have already been decimated by Government mismanagement of the sector, adverse weather conditions, bureaucracy and excessive red tape.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to facilitate a debate on a matter of national importance, namely, the withdrawal of a grant of &euro;8,500 to the Union of Students of Ireland for mental health awareness week, which takes place from 10 to 14 November and of which the Government has been aware for two years; it is planned for the awareness week to take place in 21 third level institutions throughout the country and this represents a great opportunity to present an audience with a single message regarding mental health; the theme of the week is &ldquo;coping and well-being&rdquo; and it aims to show students the benefits of an active lifestyle and destigmatise mental illness; the week is organised by students and aimed at them.</P>

	<P>It is proposed to take No. <i>a</i>12<i>a</i>, motion re sittings and business of D&aacute;il &mdash; on the Supplementary Order Paper &mdash; No. 12<i>a</i>, Supplementary Estimate for Public Services [Vote 40] back from committee, and No. 24, Broadcasting Bill 2008 [Seanad] Second Stage (resumed).  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. <i>a</i>12<i>a</i> and 12<i>a</i> shall be decided without debate and, in the case of No. 12<i>a</i>, any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We are being asked to agree to a motion relating to the arrangements for next week&rsquo;s business.  Yesterday, the Opposition parties were approached to agree a certain arrangement in respect of the ordering of business next week in order that the budget and the Government&rsquo;s scheme relating to the bail-out of the banks might be accommodated on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, of next week.  We were subsequently informed that the scheme had been prepared and a briefing was arranged for my party&rsquo;s finance spokesperson.  However, I am still unsure when the scheme will be brought before the House.</P>
        <P>On Monday the Government of Denmark announced a scheme relating to the banks in that country and details of said scheme have been made available.  On Wednesday the British Government did likewise and made available the essential details relating to its scheme.  It is nine days since the Government introduced legislation relating to the bail-out of the banks in this country, but the details of the scheme relating to that bail-out have not yet been brought before the House.  If a week is a long time in politics, it is an eternity when it comes to the banks and the financial markets.  Before I agree to the proposal before the House, I wish the Minister for Health and Children to clarify when the scheme will be introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore.  The matter of parliamentary questions for written reply not being taken on Tuesday next was not discussed with the Whips.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate if the position is different.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach noted yesterday, there will be a defining moment next week.  The budget will be introduced on Tuesday and the Taoiseach will be travelling to Brussels on Wednesday to engage in a softening up exercise in respect of the European governments regarding the aftermath of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  We understand that it may be the Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce the scheme on Wednesday afternoon next.  Clarification is required in respect of this matter.  While it is absolutely necessary to bring the scheme before the House, Wednesday would be the wrong day on which to do so.  I informed the Taoiseach yesterday that if the Government wants to arrange a sitting for Friday, Saturday or Monday, the Opposition parties will facilitate its wishes in that regard.</P>
        <P>We recognise the importance of this matter.  We also recognise the importance of our being in a position to ask the necessary questions so that the scheme might, in the national interest, be properly framed.  We should be made aware of the Government&rsquo;s intentions.  It would not be right to take this important legislation on the day following the introduction of the budget when the Taoiseach will be in Brussels.  Will the Minister clarify the position and indicate why parliamentary questions for written reply will not be taken on Tuesday?  I understand that the latter issue was not discussed at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Whips.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The outworkings relating to the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 &mdash; one of the memoranda issued last week referred to it as &ldquo;the Credit Institutions (Protection) Bill 2008&rdquo; &mdash; must be presented in detail to the House.  All the facts <Col N="233"/>pertaining to the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s intentions regarding the new powers vested in him must be set out.  What is proposed in terms of time will not allow for the full scrutiny that is necessary.  I support the case put by colleagues for an extension of the D&aacute;il sitting during the coming week and I expect a positive response to that request.  This is an extremely important issue and we must get down to properly debating and understanding the nitty-gritty of what is involved.  I ask that additional time be provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Parliamentary questions for written reply will be taken next week.  Information in that regard is provided on the Supplementary Order Paper.</P>
        <P>Intensive work is under way on the regulations to give effect to the Government&rsquo;s guarantee.  The Government discussed the matter yesterday and it is clear that the regulations must meet with the approval of the European Central Bank and the European Commission.  It would be pointless to discuss regulations that did not have the approval of both institutions.  That is the current position.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance met Opposition spokespersons last night.  We had hoped to arrange for the D&aacute;il to meet tomorrow to discuss the regulations, but I do not believe it will be possible to do so.  It is the intention of the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, to bring the regulations before the House as quickly as possible.  The Minister has taken on board many of the suggestions made by members of the Opposition last week.  As everyone is aware, we are in uncharted waters.  The purpose of the intervention was to secure the stability of the Irish banking and financial system for the benefit of all the country&rsquo;s citizens.  Given the complexity of what is involved, a significant effort has been made by those whose responsibility it is, namely, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the Attorney General, to draft these regulations for submission to the ECB and the Commission.  I understand they were submitted yesterday after the Government had considered the matter.  The Minister for Finance will stay in touch with Opposition spokespersons and the D&aacute;il will discuss them at the earliest possible opportunity.  We are all anxious to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Might that possibly happen on Monday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is the proposal regarding Nos. <i>a</i>12<i>a</i> and 12<i>a</i> agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was about to say it is great to see the Minister, Deputy Harney, back.  The only person missing in order to have matters as they used to be is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor.</P>
        <P>When Deputy Harney says it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to bring the Bill forward as quickly as possible if it is cleared by the ECB and the Commission today or tomorrow, may we take it the D&aacute;il might meet on Monday in order to devote proper and adequate time to deal with this matter separately from the budget and from the Taoiseach having to deal with heads of government in Brussels?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister give us an update in regard to the fact that the ECB has reduced interest rates by 0.5%?  We do not want a situation where Irish banks are profiteering on the backs of taxpayers.  This affects tens of thousands of householders.  Two banks have announced they will pass on the interest reduction to their mortgage payers.  That is absolutely appropriate and welcome.  However, it should be clear that this is the first test of the Government under the new regime and the legislation we passed last week.  We are now deeply involved in the banking sector.  We must see that the interests of taxpayers are protected.  It should be made clear to the banks that this interest rate reduction must be passed on to those tens of thousands of extremely hard-pressed mortgage payers in the shortest possible time.  When the Minister <Col N="234"/>replies could she tell the House whether we know the extent of rolled-up interest there is in these banks?</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill or fair deal Bill.  According to reports on the media this morning, this Bill might not become effective until the middle of next year.  There are thousands of people who are exceptionally hard-pressed in terms of paying nursing home bills.  Can the Minister advise the House when the Bill will be taken here?  Can she guarantee there will be sufficient time allocated to debate it given that all Deputies in the House will want to have a say on it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>On that point, may I speak after my party leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must call Deputy Gilmore first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two matters I want to raise.  One relates to the matter Deputy Kenny raised, namely, the matter of the banks passing on the reduction in interest rates to their customers.  There is a second matter I want to raise.  What approach should I take?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may ask both questions.  We must deal with the scheme coming before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Kenny regarding the reduction in interest rates.  That all of the main central banks in the world co-operated yesterday is unprecedented.  It is the first time we have seen major international regulation and control of banking.  The mortgage holder, the business that has a loan from a bank, and the customers of banks should benefit from that.  It would be unthinkable for the banks not to pass on that reduction in interest rates to their customers.  The Government should direct the banks here to do so given that the relationship between Government and the banking system is entirely different from what it was.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be before the House tomorrow.  We cannot go into that now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The second matter that I want to raise relates to information of which we were made aware this morning.  I refer to the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the fact that 100 cases have been struck down because the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government improperly, inappropriately and, as it turns out, illegally, appointed two county councillors to the board of the Private Residential Tenancies Board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask questions on legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with the Order of Business.  I want to ask that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come into the House today to explain that decision.  Cronyism is not new in Fianna F&aacute;il but we now have incompetent cronyism&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot go into that now.  The Deputy knows very well that it is out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to know whether the Minister will come to the House to explain why these appointments were made and account for something that has caused quite serious problems for the Private Residential Tenancies Board.</P>

	<P>Is the Deputy&rsquo;s question on legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  As my party leader pointed out this morning, two illegal appointments were made to the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  One hundred cases which were under investigation must now be reviewed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must move on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will be before the House soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may ask about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has made two illegal appointments.  Who sanctioned those appointments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should keep to questions on legislation.  I must move on.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>On which issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue raised by Deputy Kenny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the one that was in order?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of the Government using its new-found leverage in regard to the banking sector, will the Government ensure that the Minister for Finance insists that the banks pass on the full 0.5% decrease in interest rates to customers?  Further, will the Government insist that local authorities which are directly under the control of Government through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government pass on the 0.5% decrease in interest rates to those who are dependent on local authority lending agents, corporations, county councils and so on for their mortgages to purchase their homes, recognising that those who are so dependent cannot get a mortgage in the commercial sector and need that decrease more than most?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="236"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy has made his point, just as Deputies Kenny and Gilmore did, and neither of them was in order either.  The Minister must deal with the matter now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the matter of passing on the interest rate cut, liquidity is important for banks and so too are customers.  There is good competition in the banking sector for depositors and for mortgage holders and I expect the reduction will be passed on to the customers of banks.  Two banks have already indicated that and I am certainly hopeful the others will do so.</P>
        <P>In regard to the question of the D&aacute;il meeting on Monday to discuss the issue, I do not want to give a commitment that the D&aacute;il may meet on Monday and find we cannot meet that commitment.  That would lead to confusion.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the D&aacute;il will discuss this matter at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Minister for Finance will be in touch with Deputies Bruton, Burton and other Deputies in regard to this matter over the next couple of days and as soon as he has had a response from the ECB and the Commission.</P>
        <P>In regard to the appointments made in June, they are prohibited under section 169 of the relevant Act and were, therefore, <i>ultra vires</i>.  That matter was brought to the attention of the Minister recently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is he on the naughty step?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, the Minister was not advised at the time of the appointments and corrective action is being taken.</P>
        <P>On the fair deal legislation, it is the intention to have a thorough debate in this House.  It is a major piece of legislation.  It essentially deals with support for people in private and public nursing homes on an equal basis.  It is also a mental capacity Bill.  It takes on board the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  It is modern legislation which is intended to deal with the issue of diminished capacity.  That is why it has taken so long to draft.  I will give it the time it requires in this House and the Seanad in order that we can have a good debate.  I hope it will receive the support of all parties.</P>

        <P>I have asked about the property services regulatory authority Bill on a number of occasions and believe the Attorney General still has to decide whether a single or an omnibus Bill will be brought before the House.  Will the Minister indicate whether it will be a single or an omnibus Bill and, if she cannot, when does she expect the Attorney General to make his decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the property services Bill will come before the House this session.  Obviously, the Seanad must conclude its deliberations on the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill before it can be discussed here.

I cannot understand why it is being delayed.  Similarly, when will the nurses and midwives Bill be introduced?</P>

	<P>I ask the Ceann Comhairle to notify me after six minutes.</P>
        <P>This morning I will talk about the contribution of local radio, particularly in my constituency of County Clare.  Clare FM has played a significant role in giving a local voice to communities, informing them about news and sports, and raising awareness of issues that affect all communities.  It also gives a voice to us as politicians.  Without independent radio it would be difficult for us to carry on with our work.  The approach of local radio, particularly our own local radio station, is to celebrate what is local, and that is important also.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Clare FM has won many awards, including, this year, a gold medal in the ongoing news story category from the New York Festivals Radio Broadcasting Awards.  It has also won several other awards for radio documentaries.  I commend it highly on its initiatives.  In this context, I welcome the acceptance in the Seanad of the Fine Gael amendment which provides that if a radio station applies to renew its licence and no other station applies for it, the station will receive a licence for seven years rather than five.  I hope the Government will follow through on that proposal, which has been accepted in the Seanad, and perhaps consider extending the period to ten years rather than the seven years proposed, particularly if a radio station is doing a good job locally.  I urge the Minister to consider this on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>In recent years there has also been significant growth in the area of community broadcasting.  Again, I refer to my own constituency, in which two local radio stations are broadcasting to communities, including Radio Corca Baiscinn in Kilkee, which was set up in 1999 and is very successful.  It pays particular attention to equality issues and social exclusion.  I always make a point of visiting the community radio stations.  Another community radio station is the former Shannon Community Radio, now renamed Jet FM, which broadcasts on Saturdays, covering a wide variety of subjects.  Other community-based projects are in the pipeline.  We must continue to support these community radio stations.  They are important in terms of binding communities together and keeping them aware of what is happening locally.  Often radio is the candle in the window for these communities.</P>
        <P>Broadcasting is ever-evolving.  The use of the Internet has also grown considerably in recent times.  The growth in popularity of social networking sites on the Internet is something we must consider seriously, particularly with regard to suicide among young people.  We need to develop Europe-wide media guidelines on the reporting of suicides.  A total of 5% of suicides are estimated to be copycat suicides and while some social networking sites provide valuable help to young people, there are blogs and chat rooms that promote and glamorise suicide.  I hope this matter will be considered in this Bill.</P><Col N="245"/>
        <P>I had the opportunity 12 months ago, as a member of the Council of Europe, to visit Rome in the course of preparing a report on the media monopoly in Italy.  As Deputies know, Mr. Berlusconi, the current Prime Minister, owns 65% of television stations in that country.  If we add State television, this means he controlled 90% of stations.  There would seem to be a conflict of interest there.  RAI and Mediaset are the two main television stations.  At the time we did our report Mr. Berlusconi had lost his position to Mr. Prodi, so we felt his control of the majority of television stations had not influenced the outcome of the election.  We do not have that problem in this country, thank God.</P>
        <P>I spoke last night about pay television channels and certain Irish sporting events which cannot be enjoyed on our national radio stations.  This occurred last year when the Heineken Cup took place in Cardiff.  Many people could not watch the match on their national stations but had to pay to watch it on a pay-per-view channel.  This prohibits many people from watching such sports, although Munster has done so well in rugby.  This is something we must consider.  While certain sporting events have been ring-fenced, we should not be moving towards the day when the All-Ireland hurling and football finals and other major events cannot be viewed by adoring fans in the counties involved without having to pay for the privilege.  We must legislate in this regard.  I urge the Minister to sit down with the various sporting organisations and agree on this matter with a view to extending the number of Irish sporting events that will remain free to air for the Irish public to enjoy.</P>
        <P>I am happy to see that two new television stations are proposed in the Bill, a film channel and the Oireachtas channel.  It would be very entertaining for most people to see what went on in the House this morning, with arguments over appointments to the PRTB and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government moving from one seat to the other.  That would be as good as any soap opera for most viewers.  I welcome the proposal for the Oireachtas channel.  It will be worthwhile in terms of increasing understanding.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Lisbon treaty we should also consider broadcasting more of what happens in the European Parliament and the Council of Europe.  We should let people know what happens in Europe.  Part of the reason for the problems with the Lisbon treaty is that people do not know what happens in Europe.  We should consider broadcasting the work of our MEPs in the European Parliament and the procedures with regard to legislation and so on.  The same can be said for the Council of Europe, of which I am a member.  We are a long way from seeing county council meetings broadcast, but it might be as well if we did not see some of the work that goes on there.  Some good work is being carried out in local authority chambers, which is covered by local radio.</P>
        <P>I am sure RTE is tired of getting complaints about &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; coming on at 12.15 a.m.  Hopefully an Oireachtas channel will complement the work being done by Members in this House.  Very important legislation is discussed here and it is important that people are kept up to date with what is happening.  In the interim before the Oireachtas channel comes on air I hope RTE will consider broadcasting &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; earlier in the evening so that people can familiarise themselves with what is happening in the Oireachtas and we are not just speaking to ourselves, but to the public.</P>
        <P>I am delighted with the provision on junk food advertising in the legislation.  This ban is a small but important step in changing attitudes to food.  With the cap of 15% on advertising, perhaps the Minister would reconsider flexibility in terms of advertising on local radio.  He should consider extending that for two hours rather than the one-hour period at the moment where they must have ten minutes advertising in one hour.  Local radio stations carry some very interesting debates and constant advertising takes people away from the debate as other <Col N="246"/>speakers have mentioned.  I welcome the legislation and I hope it will be passed as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  I welcome the wide-ranging legislation, which will impact on the entire broadcasting sector.  We live in an age when broadcasting has changed considerably.  It was not so long ago that people were suggesting that radio stations had almost become a thing of the past, with television taking over.  There may have been a period of time when that happened.  However, local radio stations have been a great success in various parts of the country.  Nothing has complemented the work of politicians more than local radio stations.  Every morning Members raise important constituency issues here.  The catalyst for getting those stories back to our constituency is the local radio station.  Coverage is given to why we have raised it or what a Minister might say.  It brings life in Parliament here very much closer to the people.</P>
        <P>While everyone will talk about his or her own constituency, we are very pleased with the availability of local radio stations in County Tipperary.  A commercial station like Tipp FM carries stories, including issues addressed in this House, throughout the county.  The success of that station can be measured by the way it has built up its listenership.  Many people are now listening to local radio stations like Tipp FM.  On the other hand, we also have a community-based station, Tipp Mid West Community Radio.  It started up as a small station many years ago and has built up into a station, broadcasting into a whole region of west Tipperary.</P>
        <P>However, a community station is very limited in the funding it is permitted to raise to run the station.  We need to review how community radio stations are being financed.  It is very difficult for people to fundraise and also present programmes, and something needs to be done.  I seek clarification as to whether the Bill contains any changes in this regard.  It is vital that community radio stations are allowed access to funding that would cover their ongoing expenses.  Presenters need to be paid and there are travel and other expenses.  Tipp Mid West Community Radio has given great service to the community.  Those are two examples from our county of very successful commercial and community stations.  They need to be supported and developed in the long run.</P>
        <P>I take the point Deputy Breen made about the broadcast rights for Heineken Cup rugby matches.  It is sad that people, particularly in Munster, are unable to watch those matches because they are not carried live by RTE.  That trend should not be allowed to continue.  While the games need sponsorship, it is wrong for young people actively involved in rugby and other sport not to be able to watch live broadcasts of their heroes playing in another country in a great final which is a major occasion for the entire community.  I do not know whether that issue is addressed in this legislation.  However, it is a matter for debate at a later time.</P>
        <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you are a great man for going to horseracing and I like a bit of it myself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be great if I could find a few winners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We would.  There should be more opportunities for relaying the race meetings around the country.  Everybody tunes in to see Galway Races and other top race meetings that RTE broadcasts from Leopardstown and other venues.  There are some great racecourses, including Clonmel and Ballinrobe. </P>

	<P>Some older people are very interested in having a bet in their own homes.  The simple relaying of the race meetings would give them a great interest every afternoon as so many race meetings take place throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposed Oireachtas television channel.  Live broadcast of Oireachtas proceedings should be encouraged.  The Ceann Comhairle and I are both members of the Oireachtas Commission.  That commission is making headway in that regard.  It will be good for the people out there looking in and seeing the work we are doing.  It will get people, like the young people looking down at me from the Gallery today, talking about it.  What is happening in the Oireachtas will get into every home and school and will bridge the gap.  Much of what is contained in the media does not portray properly what is happening in this House and what people are saying.  The Oireachtas channel will have a major impact in connecting people at home with us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Broadcasting Bill 2008.  When dealing with Bills, you, a Cheann Comhairle, and other colleagues have often reminded me to stick with the business.  However, having listened very carefully to the contributions to this debate, I have noticed that everything has been mentioned.  I have heard people talk, as the previous speaker has just done, about horseracing, &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; and almost everything under the sun.  I presume I will get the same courtesy and I am happy to try to stay within the remit of the Bill.  My friend, Deputy Finian McGrath, asked me outside how I would weave Tallaght into the debate.  I told him that was no problem because there was much to be said about Tallaght, local radio and the need for community broadcasting facilities there.  I will deal with that shortly. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody loves the Deputy in Tallaght. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know about that, but as long as 7,000 or so voters continue to give me their first preferences, that is all right by me.  By the way, I welcome the attendance of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanifin.  I took the opportunity last night to wish her well throughout the next demanding week.  I have great confidence that she will do the job. </P>
        <P>I am sure the young students from Cork and Belvedere College in the Visitors Gallery were fascinated by the last contributor.  I am sure none of them is from Tallaght, but it is good to see such an interest in the debates.  This particular debate interests everybody.  Like it or not, television and broadcasting generally have become very much a part of our lives.  I come from a generation that witnessed the early days of television.  I can recall being in somebody&rsquo;s house and watching Floyd Patterson fight for the world heavyweight title in November 1956.  I must have been very small at the time, but I remember it.  Television and broadcasting impacts enormously, certainly in this modern generation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of the Broadcasting Bill is to provide an up-to-date legislative framework for broadcasting in Ireland.  Its aim is to establish a more flexible and market responsive model for digital terrestrial television and to facilitate the termination of the analogue service.  The Bill has a number of key features which include the establishment of a single content regulator for all commercial, community and public service broadcasters in Ireland.  The function will be performed by the new broadcasting authority of Ireland, BAI.  Other colleagues have noted that additional features of the proposed legislation include further functions to be carried out by the BAI &mdash; regulations in respect of DTT multiplexes and the duty of the commission for communications regulation in respect of sound broadcasting multiplex and multiplex contracts, <Col N="248"/>etc.  Also addressed in the Bill is the right of reply mechanism, television licences and an extension of the public service remit of RTE and TG4.</P>
        <P>A number of Deputies referred to TG4.  I hope the other broadcasters are not over-sensitive about us mentioning TG4, but I can recall the work years ago of our former colleague, the late Deputy Jim Tunney.  If they call me &ldquo;Mr. Tallaght&rdquo;, they called him &ldquo;Mr. Finglas&rdquo;.  He was a renowned Minister and chairman of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party and he had a particular gr&aacute; for the development of services in what was to become TG4.  People such as the Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and others have done a great deal of work in that regard since.  People might not believe that much of what TG4 does might prove attractive to me, but I spend a good deal of time watching it.  I often joked in the early days that I was watching it to see the old John Wayne movies, but as the service has developed, so too has my interest in it.  TG4 is particularly forceful in projecting the positive message of culture and sporting activities in Ireland.  I have heard many people, certainly in the Dublin region, make the point in recent times that its sport coverage is second to none, although the coverage of sport on RTE has been very good.  However, TG4 is getting right down to the ground as far as sports coverage is concerned and it should be applauded for it.</P>
        <P>People in the know tell me the station is producing programmes cost effectively.  This is an example to the rest of the broadcasting industry at a time when we are all talking about cost efficiency and value for money.  I hope people in Montrose and at TV3 in Ballymount are watching these developments with interest.  TG4 has made an enormous impression throughout the country and people such as the late Deputy Tunney fought the battle for its survival from the beginning.  Sometimes the going was difficult because people had other priorities.  However, he has been proved right and it is great credit to him and many others that this is the case.</P>
        <P>Other speakers have dealt with the general sports coverage on all the stations.  Such coverage has been very worthwhile in recent times.  RTE is clearly doing a tremendous job.  The coverage this year of GAA fixtures has been second to none.  All the other sports coverage, including TV3&rsquo;s, has been excellent.  While I have nothing against Sky and occasionally watch a premier league match on it &mdash; although I do not have the sports service in my house and must use other people&rsquo;s &mdash; a serious point must be made about support for the &ldquo;free to view&rdquo; concept as far as sporting fixtures are concerned.  Deputy Pat Breen referred to the fact that Munster and rugby fans generally have to depend on different channels to see their heroes play.  That is true of many sporting activities and has happened regarding the Irish international soccer team as well.  We must continue to look at that and see whether the &ldquo;free to view&rdquo; concept can be maintained, regardless of the needs of the associations or the demands coming from Sky and other stations.</P>
        <P>I hope we all support that view and I look forward to the time &mdash; just to be parochial again &mdash; when League of Ireland matches are televised live from Tallaght.  The stadium there is progressing very well.  I say this because I believe the Ceann Comhairle mentioned the fact, and I know I will be forgiven.  The Ceann Comhairle is remembered with great affection in Tallaght for the work he did as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism by those of us who wanted to strongly support and promote the idea of the Shamrock Rovers stadium.  It is to his credit, and many others, that Shamrock Rovers will be playing in the new municipal stadium from next February.  I hope the Ceann Comhairle takes the opportunity to come out because people appreciate the work he did in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As far as the Broadcasting Bill is concerned, I encourage people to continue to watch the various sporting activities.  The League of Ireland is going through a doldrum period at present and it is important that we promote what it is doing.  Shamrock Rovers in Tallaght will be very much part of that.</P><Col N="249"/>
        <P>I mentioned earlier that I wanted to talk about community radio.  I often hear Deputies talk about the importance of local  radio throughout the country.  Developments in recent years have been particularly significant in that regard.  All colleagues take advantage of local radio to get their message across and to answer questions that are posed.  There is a very strong network in Dublin.  I was on Newstalk last night and Q104 earlier in the day.  Other stations such as Country FM and 98 provide excellent services, certainly in terms of news, and I am at an age when I like to listen to some of the music.</P>
        <P>Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country.  We no longer have Tallaght Community Radio, however, and last night there was a meeting of the Tallaght Radio Forum which is seeking to have it reintroduced.  Everybody in the House is conscious of the worth of local radio and supports the concept.  It is a great shame that my town, with the third largest population in the country, does not have its own community broadcasting system.  I appeal to everybody who has an interest in that regard to make an effort to bring back community radio to Tallaght.  I hope there will be a great deal of support for that.</P>
        <P>Colleagues have referred to the impact of television on all our lives over the past five decades.  My 6-year old granddaughter was in my office in the House for a short while yesterday and she asked if she could watch television.  This is the era we live in.  Television was new to my generation.  We watched a few news programmes and football matches on the BBC and, as television evolved, more attractive programmes were made.  However, nowadays my television viewing is restricted not only by my workload, but because I do not feel the need to sit and watch programmes.  I watch programmes I would be expected to watch such as &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;, news bulletins and &ldquo;The Week on Politics&rdquo;.  I have never had the opportunity to appear on the programme but that might happen someday.  I hope I will not get into trouble for saying I like watching Vincent Browne&rsquo;s programme every night.  I hope he will not be upset.  The programme uses a different format and it is often entertaining.  It has gained its own niche and many people watch it every night.  For those of us interested in the political system, it makes for good television.</P>
        <P>My constituency colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, once said the audience for &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; was confined to insomniacs and drunks.  I do not know whether that has changed but the programme should be broadcast at a different time because more people would watch it.  I have an open mind about an Oireachtas television channel.  I do not know whether people would watch proceedings all day.  They would watch an Order of Business similar to this morning&rsquo;s, which was exciting and where the Ceann Comhairle was a big star, as ever.  The set pieces are always interesting and if they were broadcast, a positive message would be sent to the public but the remainder of the House&rsquo;s proceedings would be challenging and demanding for viewers.  For example, I watched Prime Minister&rsquo;s Question Time from the House of Commons yesterday and it made for good television.</P>
        <P>Many people are cynical about politicians and politics and we need to get a positive message across to them.  There are many young people in the Visitors Gallery and when people visit the Parliament, they witness the good work that is going on and they are often impressed.  Television has a role to play in that regard but, at the same time, I wonder about broadcasting coverage of D&aacute;il proceeding from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. and how that might evolve.  That will be an interesting debate.</P>
        <P>It is also important not to underestimate the value of radio, which has been part of all our lives for a long time.  Significant numbers of people listen to radio and I have referred to the importance of community radio.  I listen to talk radio in the morning.  I always listen to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and Ryan Tubridy, if I have the opportunity.  I do not have much opportunity to listen to Pat Kenny&rsquo;s programme and I hope that does not upset him, but radio has an important <Col N="250"/>role to play.  The development of radio broadcasting must continue and I hope those who implement this legislation will take account of that.</P>
        <P>I read reports earlier this week about the challenges presented by technology and how we must be careful about how technology impacts on young people, in particular.  Intense challenges will be thrown up in future to control television content.  While digital television is an exciting development and everyone supports it, sometimes I wonder where all these developments are headed.  I often wonder how my grandmother might react to the types of programmes being beamed into homes, which have a negative potential.  Television programmes are good when they deliver a positive message and help to educate viewers, but television can also be a dangerous medium and we must be careful about how it is controlled.</P>
        <P>Television has also become very intrusive.  Deputy Breen referred to John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s visited to Ireland in June 1963 and how television coverage generated great excitement.  The Pope&rsquo;s visit to Ireland in 1979 was another milestone.  When one turns on Sky News nowadays, one is almost taken into people&rsquo;s houses or war zones.  Television has become an intrusive medium whereby one cannot sneeze without it being picked up by a camera.  That presents its own challenges.  Sky News uses a format where the same news stories are broadcast every 15 minutes, which is irritating, and it wrecks my head.  I have time to watch a little television on the occasional night at the weekend.  Sky News runs news off a machine and I do not like such news coverage.  I often retreat to RTE to watch more newsy programmes and the station does a good job in that regard.</P>
        <P>TV3 is running advertisements regarding its new midday programme.  Television has taken on a new role by providing for different audiences.  I try to watch a little television late at night whereas many others watch programmes in the morning.  Recently I heard a woman say she puts &ldquo;TV-AM&rdquo; on in the background during breakfast because it cheers up everybody in the house and it can be interesting.  However, I cannot get my head around the concept of people sitting down and watching television for the rest of day.  They watch talk shows, followed by American courtroom series, adventure programmes and then soaps.  On the other hand, these programmes provide entertainment for those who cannot leave their houses for whatever reason.</P>
        <P>Broadcasters must take responsibility because they have a captive audience.  Many people watch television all day and when schools finish for the day, many children want to watch television.  Given the number of stations dedicated to children&rsquo;s programming, many parents try to limit the time their children can watch television.  They encourage their children to do their homework before allowing them to watch television.  Broadcasters must take responsibility for the programming they provide at a time many channels are beamed into homes, particularly in the Dublin region, to make sure people are not watching unsuitable programmes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Broadcasting is regulated by a number of bodies &mdash; the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the RTE Authority.  The new organisation will encompass the functions of these bodies, operate independently and, for the most part, be funded by a sectoral levy applicable to all broadcasters.</P>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to make my contribution on this important legislation which I look forward to supporting.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important Bill.  Broadcasting is a wide canvas and, were one geared up and permitted, one could speak about it for three hours.  While there are a number of major issues, the Bill in its entirety is welcome.  It must be passed because there are significant external pressures which I shall address.</P><Col N="251"/>
        <P>Unless the national broadcaster is able to keep up with fantastic, sensational changes, we will be left in a backwater.  RTE, in terms of its television and sound elements, has had a public broadcasting remit for years.  Given the annual levy of &euro;160 and the responsibility placed on any governing authority to direct the affairs of RTE One, RTE Two, TG4, RTE&rsquo;s radio stations, the Houses of the Oireachtas channel and so on, it is important that RTE be seen to be a broadcaster for all of the people.  By and large, it does a good job, although it would be easy to state the opposite, as many do.  It stands up well against competition from around the world.  Given the intrusion of Sky News, Fox News and so on &mdash; one can watch an African station at the touch of a button &mdash; we must remember that our national broadcaster and TV3, which is also useful, although not a part of this debate, are able to compete.</P>
        <P>As Deputy O&rsquo;Connor stated, everything, every minute of every day, on Sky News is sensational.  I do not have many opportunities to watch television, but such sensationalism does not appeal to me.  Balanced, fair and reasonable reporting of an incident as soon as humanly possible is vital and what our broadcasters try to do.  While I am not saying that Sky News, Fox News and so on do not do so, many viewers watching the sensationalism get the impression that there is never another side to a story.  Good, bad or indifferent, it was a remarkable red flash.  Our broadcasters should not go down that road.</P>
        <P>For many years I was critical of RTE in one respect.  Anything concerning the regions was placed on the back burner until changes were made in recent years.  Regional correspondents have made a considerable difference.  For example, the programme &ldquo;Nationwide&rdquo; encompasses many of television&rsquo;s good aspects.  It is predominantly a good news programme rooted in communities around Ireland to pick out the best actions that local communities take to better themselves.  This is an important aspect of radio and television coverage that acknowledges the traditions and values of people across the country without being confined to a particular area.  A sister programme is more or less engaging in the same type of reporting within Dublin city.  It is important that we have more broadcasting of this kind.</P>
        <P>None of us wants to be a harbinger of bad news, but sometimes there seems to be a bias in radio and television coverage towards bad news stories.  Unfortunately, there is a great deal of bad news in this big, bad world, but there is also plenty of good news.  There should be a balance and RTE is beginning to get it right.  The viewership and listenership have as many choices as there are people.  It must be difficult for the controller of programmes in any television network to always get the balance right.  Obviously, it is not always right, but controllers are doing better than they have for a long time.</P>
        <P>Television is a powerful medium.  The new governing body will need to consider the question of images portrayed to children.  I am long past the stage where my children watch programmes like &ldquo;The Den&rdquo; and so on, but my grandchildren are watching them.  I cannot discuss too many of them because I do not watch them, but many of them are good.  One can rest assured that &ldquo;Bob the Builder&rdquo; is entertaining, has an educational aspect and portrays the right image to young children.  However, there are programmes on television at times when children can watch them that are not suitable for them.  We must be careful to control such programmes in order that what children view is good, entertaining and educational, as much of what many children do is picked up from television.</P>
        <P>Concerning advertising, I have a bee in my bonnet about all programmes that highlight the use of alcohol.  I accept the principle that every mature adult should be able to act on his or her own behalf.  I am not interested in censorship.  However, the overly glamorous advertising of alcohol is playing holy hell.  It now appears that one cannot have a social gathering without the most beautiful people drinking to their hearts&rsquo; content and that everyone should aspire to be like them.  Nothing could be further from the truth &mdash; if people could see how the advertise<Col N="252"/>ments are put together.  During the coming years we must be vigilant in preventing such advertising from continuing.</P>
        <P>In the past few days I heard some of my colleagues refer to the major problem of obesity.  It is a greater problem than we thought it would be five or six years ago.  Dubious food products which I will not name are being highlighted.  These are extraordinarily fatty foods &mdash; rubbish and trash.  We must have a leveller because if the advertising of these foods continues, we will have to place a health warning on them, similar to what is carried on cigarette packets.  It could state that if one were to eat the particular food product, one would not be doing oneself any good.  If it was practical to do so, I presume advertisers would want to change their ways.</P>
        <P>I refer to the relationship between the national broadcaster and local television and radio stations.  I am lucky to be in the House as long as anyone and have seen dramatic changes.  I distinctly remember the night Teilif&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann came on the air, a momentous occasion in our house and I assure Members it was not our own television set.  It meant a new step forward for Irish society.  Ten or 15 years ago we had the advent of local radio services.  I have heard no Member suggest this was a bad development.  Local radio services have an outstanding connection with people within the franchise area.  Irrespective of what happens, an accident, a funeral or the opening of a new library, the local radio station has the news in ten minutes, sometimes in ten seconds.  Local radio stations have become very professional to the extent that most newscasters and public affairs debates are as good as any carried by the national broadcaster.  The level of professionalism is significant; the same goes for local television services but these have not spread as far.  It is a costly job.</P>
        <P>It should be in the remit of the new broadcasting authority to strengthen ties.  I understand some 5% of the television licence fee revenue will be made available for certain projects, an important development.  No one likes paying a licence fee if one can get away without paying it and given the programming available, we hope the fee is value for money.  It is important that local radio stations such as Galway Bay FM do not feel isolated.  These local stations should receive help for certain projects under the national system.  Whether we believe &euro;160 per year is good or bad value, an issue on which everyone has a view, it should be paid and collected once it becomes law.  I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and remember a number of debates during which we discovered that it was extraordinarily difficult to have a system of collection that was value for money.  I do not think the current system does this but it is important that the message be communicated that those who do not pay the fee are spongers.  In effect, by non-payment they ensure neighbours will have to pay more next time.  This is an unfortunate development and the people concerned are nothing short of spongers.</P>
        <P>I am not blessed by fluent in Irish but I am very impressed with TG4.  From small beginnings the station has reached a level of professionalism that stands comparison with any station of its size and status elsewhere in Europe.  One does not have to be fluent in Irish to enjoy TG4.  When it started, it showed Gaelic football, hurling, camogie and ladies football matches which have brought a huge audience to the station.</P>

	<P>Only for the fact that Deputy Creed watches them, he would not know they were on.  I assume he has somthing in common with John Wayne.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Ros na R&uacute;n&rdquo; is an example of a programme shown by the station.  It has a facility to ensure traditional ways in Gaeltacht areas and rural life are unlikely to be forgotten.  These are shown in the best possible light.</P><Col N="253"/>
        <P>The station has created a source of employment for the very best producers and researchers.  Many can now be seen named in the credits on RTE, TV3 and the BBC.  It is a major training ground for many highly skilled young men and women and provides an outlet for their professionalism.</P>
        <P>It is incumbent on stations to carry as many high quality home produced programmes as possible.  It is one thing to have a home produced programme but if it is trash, it is no good to anyone.  Programmes such as &ldquo;The Clinic&rdquo; are of high quality.  The more that are produced, the greater the grip on the people, irrespective of what is beamed in by Sky Television or the BBC.  Irish people will see such programmes as reflecting their values and interests.  As long as RTE continues with such programmes, it is the future in terms of competition.  It does not always get it right but nobody does.</P>
        <P>I may sound dated in referring to a programme that I love to watch, &ldquo;Reeling in the Years&rdquo;.  I had the good fortune of being involved in many of the events covered, sometimes with a peripheral role.  I do not know the ratings for that programme but they must be high because it is being re-run.  The series dates back to 1962 or 1963 and progresses through the years.  There is a major opening for nostalgia programmes.</P>
        <P>A Fine Gael amendment to the Bill was tabled in the Seanad and, as far as I am aware, accepted by the Government.  It stated that in cases where only one group was looking for a local radio licence and was successful, that group&rsquo;s contract would not then be for five years but would run for seven years.  It is a minor matter but is extremely important because in an area where there is not too much interest, the incumbents would have an opportunity over seven years to develop programming to its liking.  Many others would wish to be involved thereafter.  We will follow the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Eamon Scanlon.  I welcome the Bill which is very detailed and seeks to deal with virtually all aspects of broadcasting in this country.  As Deputy Connaughton said, it is a return to 1960 when RTE was established.  Much legislation passed down the years will be consolidated by this Bill.  It has been a long time coming but is very welcome.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A new regulatory authority will replace the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, BCC.  The broadcasting authority of Ireland, BAI, will consist of the authority and two independent statutory boards, a contracts award committee and a compliance committee.  I am not sure that we need three committees to deal with the implementation of this legislation.  Perhaps when the Minister responds he will explain why he devised this rather bureaucratic system of dealing with the Broadcasting Bill.  One authority with all-embracing powers would be a more important body than an authority, a contracts committee and a compliance committee.  This seems somewhat over-regulated.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which deals with broadcasting matters, will have an input into future appointments to the boards.  The members have relevant knowledge and will offer a major input into the new legislation.  I welcome the fact that the Minister recognises the importance of the committee by consulting with it before the board is finalised.</P>
        <P>There are also new codes and rules for broadcasters.  I have a particular interest in the area of advertising for children.  We must have a code of conduct in respect of the advertising of children&rsquo;s toys, food, drinks and other things that can have a detrimental effect on the health of children.  From time to time parents raise issues about advertising with me, as I am sure they do with other Deputies.  Many consider its timing unsuitable for the programmes.  It promotes <Col N="254"/>foodstuffs that are high in sugar content contributing to obesity, as mentioned by Deputy Connaughton.  The advertising of children&rsquo;s toys is a bugbear of mine and of a number of people up and down the country.  When it comes to the promotion of toys, Christmas has already started.  This puts severe pressure on parents who want to buy toys at Christmas time when they have money to do so.  They do not want their children to beg them to buy the toys now.  The Minister must look seriously at this issue.</P>
        <P>Part of the Bill deals with television licences and proposes a range of changes to the current arrangement of television licensing in Ireland  I hope this will not be the end of An Post in the operation of television licensing because that organisation has given a good service in collecting television licences.  Of course we have the defaulters, the people who, no matter what is done, will not want to pay for their television licence.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposal stating that it will be at the discretion of An Post that television licence defaulters should pay a fine and buy a licence rather than proceed to court is a wise one.  To introduce an on-the-spot fine for not having a licence followed by the purchase of the licence is a way around the problem.  At present, by the time An Post takes the court action and gets the person into court, the court system is clogged up.  Therefore, I welcome the fact that the Minister is considering having on-the-spot fines for defaulters combined with purchase of the licence.  It is a good suggestion.</P>
        <P>We get a good service from RTE 1 and 2 and TG4 and television in general offers good service in this country.  RTE comes in for serious criticism from time to time about some of its programmes and about being politically biased.  However, for the amount of money expended each year, RTE provides a very good service in this country.  From time to time I might not be happy with some decisions the organisation might take or the political lines it might hold but I am a strong supporter of RTE, television and radio.  We get good value for money in that area.</P>
        <P>Deputy Connaughton mentioned TG4.  The station has done tremendous work in promoting Gaelic games off-season.  RTE covers these at the height of the season, and TV3 also covered some games this year.  However, TG4 does a great job in promoting the club championships, the international rules games and Railway Cup games.  Long may that continue.  Some of the station&rsquo;s programmes are watched by people such as myself who are not good at the Gaeilge.  TG4 promotes Irish culture, Irish language, Irish song and music and that is important.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; was mentioned earlier in respect of the time it is beamed out to the country, which is usually at midnight, 12.30 a.m. or 1 a.m.  There is need for a change there but we also need our own channel.  There is all-party agreement to examine how the Oireachtas might have its own channel and how it might operate.  I know that much discussion is going on in the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office, in the Commission and also in the committee that I chair concerning how we might implement an Oireachtas channel at a reasonable cost.  Many new channels are costly but it is essential that we look at having an Oireachtas channel.  We could thereby promote politics and bring politics out to the people.  That is something all of us try to do in our own way at local level and a channel of our own would certainly help.</P>
        <P>There is also an issue about the effects soaps may have.  Parents talk about this and I have no answer as I do not watch soaps.  Soaps are widely watched at peak time and people tell me that many of them feature cases of rape, murder and suicide from time to time.  What effect is this having on young people?  Organisations dealing with the welfare of children get very concerned about this issue and the Minister should examine it in terms of its effects on young people.</P>
        <P>The advertising of alcohol has been mentioned.  It would be hard to stop all such advertising although that decision could be taken.  It could also be decided that television advertising should not glamorise drink but then one goes to Croke Park or Gaelic games parks up and down the <Col N="255"/>country, one attends Munster rugby or international matches, or soccer matches, where all the hoardings are advertising drink of every kind.  That has an effect on the promotion of drink.  I am not sure a total ban on alcohol from television screens will stop young people from drinking.  Education is important and we should start with an education programme in our schools about the effects of drink.  Although many people believe a complete ban would be a solution, I am unsure of this.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a couple of points regarding the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, representatives of which I met recently.  While it welcomes the Bill in general, it seeks a number of changes to the fast-track application process for radio licences.  It seeks to have the licence period changed from seven years.  The initial proposal was for a five-year period but the Seanad suggested a seven-year period.  However, the IBI suggests that the period should be changed to ten years and the Minister should consider this issue.</P>
        <P>The IBI has concerns in respect of digital broadcasting.  It has noted the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, has no policy at present regarding digital broadcasting for local, regional or national independent radios.  Until such time as such a policy is developed, the IBI considers that including provisions in respect of digital broadcasting in the Bill may prove costly and may cause problems regarding adherence for local radio stations.  Consequently, it also seeks some changes in this regard.</P>
        <P>The IBI also seeks changes in the levy proposed by the Minister.  While it is not opposed to the levy <i>per se</i>, it considers that the manner in which it will be implemented should be changed to allow for greater flexibility.  Moreover, such a levy only should kick in when radio stations are making a profit.  The former Taoiseach removed the 3% levy and the IBI now wonders why the present Government intends to reintroduce it.  Apparently, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, gave a commitment that it would not be reintroduced.  Perhaps the Minister also should consider this issue.</P>
        <P>While one cannot legislate for a downturn in the economy, the IBI is highly concerned in this regard at present.  It considers that as the economic downturn will lead to fewer advertisements and less income, the levy may not be the most practical measure to take at present.  I now wish to give way to my colleague.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a few comments on this Bill.  The Bill is about how broadcasting will be defined and how the broadcasting industry will be organised and managed in Ireland.  At a time of massive developments in the arena of communications, such a Bill is highly appropriate.  The legislation deals with issues pertaining to the format, structure and model of broadcasting.  It deals with publicly-funded broadcasters and those which are not funded directly by the licence fee but through commercial advertising.  While a publicly-funded broadcaster is required, public funding brings with it real responsibilities regarding the approach such a broadcaster should take.  Being funded by the public places an additional set of obligations upon a broadcaster and certain standards must be maintained.  Moreover, a level of excellence that may not be expected of independent broadcasters may also be required.  That constitutes the reality for organisations that are funded by the people.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that a public broadcaster is not a State broadcaster.  The public broadcaster should not be a direct extension of the State in its form and functions.  I strongly believe that it also is appropriate to regulate RTE in the same way as other independent, commercial broadcasters, such as TV3.  RTE is in a privileged position inasmuch as it has access to a licence fee.  This advantage for the station cannot be underestimated.  One of the best recent developments has been the introduction of competitors into the television market in Ireland.</P><Col N="256"/>
        <P>I still can recall when there was only one television channel in Ireland.  I also can recall that there were no televisions in the street on which I was reared.  However, we were fortunate to have access to a shop that sold televisions.  It was operated by a decent man and more children would gather outside his shop window to watch &ldquo;The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin&rdquo; and a few similar programmes that I remember vaguely than would go to the cinema.  He placed a small speaker outside the shop to enable everyone to hear what was going on.  Things certainly have changed since then as practically every room in every house has a television, which is to be welcomed in certain circumstances.  We have come a long way since then and have further to go.</P>
        <P>TV3 has been a welcome addition to the market.  This was seen most recently in respect of coverage of the All-Ireland championships matches.  In the most recent season, TV3 showed live coverage of some major matches and did a good job of that.  Competition is a good thing, which RTE should welcome, rather than fear.  It should consider it as an incentive to maintain and improve its standards.  Everyone experiences competition, be it in business, politics or whatever walk of life, and it keeps everyone focused.</P>
        <P>I support the Bill&rsquo;s overall approach.  While other Members have referred to it as being cautious rather than radical, it will ensure that we have adequate regulation over the broadcasting sector.  We must never underestimate the importance of the broadcasting sector in people&rsquo;s lives.  Many older people, who may be living alone, rely on television or radio as their main source of keeping in touch with the outside world.  Whether by listening to Joe Duffy on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;, although Members may not always agree with what he says, or by watching &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; on Friday nights, people rely on such programmes to inform their opinions.  Consequently, it is important to put in place relevant regulation as the broadcasting sector has great influence on people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P>The Bill will lead to the establishment of a new broadcasting authority.  It is crucial that it will not simply be the current Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in a new guise.  The proposed Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will assume the functions of the existing Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and will take on a number of new roles and responsibilities.  It will have two statutory boards, namely, the contracts award committee and the compliance committee.  The authority will have overall responsibility for the organisation with regard to preparing codes and rules for broadcasters.</P>
        <P>This is an important Bill.  It is a detailed and comprehensive legislative proposal that seeks to deal with virtually all aspects of regulation and the provision of broadcasting content in Ireland.  It introduces many new concepts, grants a range of new functions to broadcasters and regulators and sets the framework for new activities and services, especially in light of technological developments.</P>
        <P>The Broadcasting Bill consolidates and revises almost 50 years of Irish broadcasting legislation, which I welcome.  It repeals the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960, which established RTE, and the Radio and Television Act 1988, which allowed for independent commercial broadcasting for the first time.  Under this Bill, the entire body of broadcasting legislation now is presented in a single, consolidated Bill.  This is a more efficient model and is necessary at this time of advancement in modern communications.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the contribution of local radio stations.  Given the geographical position of my constituency, it is covered by two radio stations, namely, Mid West Radio and Ocean FM and I acknowledge the contributions they make to the lives of elderly people, many of whom live alone in isolated places.  The stations schedule programming to facilitate those people in the form of sport, local issues, farming matters, current affairs and death notices.  The latter is <Col N="257"/>a highly important part of radio programming for many people who wish to keep informed in respect of their local community.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the opportunity to comment on the Broadcasting Bill 2008.  The Bill as passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann is comprehensive in that it consolidates five or six other Acts.  It is 167 pages long, contains 181 detailed sections and 13 parts.  Overall, while the Bill contains some very good aspects, Fine Gael will seek to amend others on Committee Stage.  The Bill seeks to establish the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, which will take over the functions of the existing Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, as well as receiving some other new functions.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland&rsquo;s existence mainly because in my previous employment I used to pass its offices on a daily basis.  I entered the office and had a chat with its staff to ascertain what are its functions.  I am aware of their existence.  It is welcome, particularly in the current economic climate, that a levy will be put on broadcasters so taxpayers will not have to fund these new authorities, except in the first year of establishment.</P>
        <P>Section 8 relates to the appointment of members to the broadcasting authority of Ireland, BAI.  It indicates that five members will be appointed by the Government on the nomination of the Minister, with four members to be appointed on the advice of the relevant joint Oireachtas committee.  That is a welcome development which means members of a committee will have much more power in ensuring people with the proper qualifications and who are experienced in the areas will be appointed to the broadcasting authority of Ireland.  Such oversight will mean there will be no political appointments or cronyism, which will improve public accountability.</P>
        <P>On this side of the House we wish to ensure all members are vetted by the joint Oireachtas committee rather than just half of them.  Five members will be appointed by the Minister and just four will be appointed by the committee.</P>
        <P>With regard to the statutory committees, half the appointments will be made by the Government on the nomination of the Minister and the other half will be made by the BAI from its own staff and membership.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources should have more of a role in this.  I welcome that the chief executive officer of the BAI will have to attend the Committee of Public Accounts and will have to account, in particular, for the level of expenditure.  He or she will also be answerable to the other Oireachtas committees.</P>
        <P>I see deadlines and timelines will have to be adhered to by the BAI in dealing with complaints brought forward by people who feel their reputation has been hurt or incorrect facts have been given out.  For broadcasters in breach of the terms of their contract, the compliance committee may recommend to the High Court that a fine of up to &euro;250,000 be imposed.  That is significant punishment for anybody seen to be making deliberate attempts to injure people&rsquo;s reputations and names.</P>
        <P>Section 81 deals with the appointment to the boards of both RTE and TG4, with each of the boards containing 12 people and an equal gender balance.  That is welcome and we could learn <Col N="258"/>from that in this House in ensuring we improve our gender balance.  Six members are to be nominated by the Minister, with four nominated by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This is very innovative and seems to be the way forward.  We must ensure that in future nomination processes, people have the relevant experience and qualification before appointment to boards.  It should happen in this instance so that politics and politicians can be protected.</P>
        <P>The legislation deals with the directors general and chairpersons of RTE and TG4 having to attend committee meetings in the Houses of the Oireachtas, which is also necessary.  The Bill will ensure RTE will provide a television service to Irish communities abroad.  We are all aware of the Irish communities, particularly in England and the undocumented in America, and these issues must be aired on RTE&rsquo;s broadcasts outside the country.  They will give a better understanding of the problems experienced by the Irish.  I am sure we are all very aware of the plight of the Irish in England who have hit on hard times.</P>
        <P>The decision to cover proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas through a free-to-air service is a welcome development.  It will inform the public to a greater degree as to what goes on here in the Houses, particularly in committees.  People will have more of an understanding of the process, know what Deputies do when they come to the House and what the job of a Deputy involves.</P>
        <P>The Irish Film Board will be provided with its own dedicated channel, which is also to be welcomed.  The Irish film industry enjoyed some great years but over the past few years it has not been as great as it once was.  There have been more Irish productions recently, notably &ldquo;The Tudors&rdquo;, a series made in Ardmore Studios.  Some members of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources visited that location.  We must protect the Irish film industry and particularly the tax reliefs and incentives which exist.  They must continue.</P>
        <P>Section 159 deals with the major sporting events.  Perhaps the Minister will provide some more information as to which major sporting events are in mind, as the Bill does not specify.  Will it relate to the all-Ireland finals and ensure they will be provided on a free basis?  Will it apply to Irish soccer matches?</P>
        <P>The manner in which the television licence is collected is very outdated and costly.  The process should be greatly improved upon and perhaps when somebody purchases a television, the levy should be paid up front and once only, especially for new customers.</P>
        <P>Local radio and television services clearly provide a terrific service to local communities in various parts of the country which would not be informed of local events, news and current affairs issues otherwise.  Independent television and radio stations must be protected and the Government must ensure adequate funding remains so the service can be provided.  They provide great opportunities for volunteers or those interested in presenting on radio stations to get involved, learn how programmes are put together and the various skills used in making programmes.  That would give people great confidence.  Many people working in these radio stations are volunteers and do not get paid.  They should be commended for the good work they do.</P>
        <P>The restriction on junk food advertising is an excellent development and the area of obesity has been covered by other Deputies.  The Minister is aware it is a significant issue.  There has been information in the media recently about the content of cereals &mdash; there is more sugar in Irish cereals than in their counterparts in Australia or other countries, for example, and that should be examined.</P><Col N="259"/>
        <P>There are many positive developments in the Bill.  We would like to see alcohol advertisement banned completely.  Regarding changes, our party will table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few brief words.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle might let me know when I have a minute remaining as I will share time with Deputy Andrew Doyle.</P>
        <P>The landscape for broadcasting has changed very significantly over recent years.  When I entered this House initially, most households throughout the country only had terrestrial television but in the last 20 years, the international reach of broadcasting corporations has become truly global, particularly with the advent of the Internet.  At a more local level there has been the successful explosion in popularity of local radio stations.  Broadcasting has changed very significantly and in that context, the legislation is welcome.</P>
        <P>Some people have argued, with regard to some provisions in the Bill, that because of our inability to police non-terrestrial broadcasters from outside the country, we should sit and do nothing.  I do not accept this argument.  On the contrary, it is a reason to take an initiative at European Union level, where Ireland has the capacity to pursue these matters, or at a global level.  If, in choosing to restrict the reach of advertising for children it transpires that children continue to have access to advertisements prohibited under the legislation on other broadcasters such as Sky television, it will make a strong case for having an international code of conduct.  We should not take a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach.  In any case, the non-terrestrial broadcasters tend to construct their advertising in compliance with national legislation.</P>
        <P>I propose to focus on the legislation&rsquo;s provisions on junk food advertising by the food industry.  While an initiative is needed on this issue, it must be developed in consultation with the food industry.  A legitimate criticism has been made that consultation on the Bill has been insufficient.  I hope further consultation will take place with the food industry before Committee Stage.  While I support in principle the decision to include in the legislation the ultimate sanction &mdash; a ban on advertising &mdash; the codes of conduct provided for should be devised in consultation with the food industry.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Terence Flanagan, referred to an interesting recent report which showed that sugar and salt levels in certain cereals are significantly higher in Ireland than in the same branded products in New Zealand and Australia.  This appears to be due to a perception that awareness of dietary and healthy living issues is greater in New Zealand and Australia than in Ireland.  The House has a role to play in ensuring that products for which advertisements targeted at children are broadcast on television are healthy in the wider sense.  There is no appetite, if I may be pardoned the pun, to take a big brother approach by arguing that children should never go to McDonalds or eat pizza or the sugary cereals to which they are inclined to gravitate.  A balance must be struck.</P>
        <P>I have raised previously in the House the failure to target sufficiently sports funding at activity for all and the focus on the development of niche sports.  While I support the Bill in principle, healthy foods produced by the dairy and meat industries must not be categorised as unhealthy by those who police the legislation.  These products form the backbone of the Irish food industry and are worth approximately &euro;20 billion to the economy every year.  The food sector directly employs 48,000 people with as many as 50,000 others employed indirectly.</P>
        <P>Television has an enormous reach and exercises a disproportionate influence on children.  Anyone with children will be aware of the impact of television advertising on children.  For this reason, the Bill should include the ultimate sanction.  I hope the codes of conduct will be framed in consultation with the industry in a manner that recognises the challenges we face in respect <Col N="260"/>of issues such as childhood obesity.  It is impossible not to acknowledge the extent of this problem.  However, the new codes must also be balanced, fair and reasonable and the industry must be able to live with them.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Terence Flanagan for his generosity in sharing time.</P>
        <P>The Broadcasting Bill 2008, which consolidates, revises or repeals various Acts dating back to the Broadcasting Act 1960 which established RTE and created a basis for public service broadcasting, is welcome.  Television is probably the most useful but dangerous device in any household.  As Deputies indicated, with the advent of digital transmission we will soon be able to watch radio and television programmes, play DVDs, PlayStation, the X-box and music and access practically all other forms of media on our television sets.  The legislation arms the State and Oireachtas with the ability to deal with this development.</P>
        <P>Given the speed with which advances are being made in the media, it will be necessary to ensure the Bill has an inbuilt capacity to evolve to deal with the evolution of the media, specifically television.  Until now, we have constantly been in catch-up mode.</P>
        <P>It is hard to believe it is 20 years since the Independent Radio and Television Commission, IRTC, was established.  Community radio has been important for local communities, providing, for example, access to training in radio and communications which had not previously been available.</P>
        <P>The rationalisation of a number of State agencies in the legislation is welcome in the current economic climate.  The board of the proposed broadcasting authority of Ireland has the responsibility to ensure the authority moves with advancing technology and is in a position to respond, react and, if necessary, control the medium of television.</P>
        <P>Deputy Creed addressed the issue of advertisements for food products.  The food and drinks industry will make the case that it will face a distinct disadvantage until such time as international agreement is reached on the standards to apply to the content of food advertisements transmitted on television.  In fairness to the industry, it has provided guideline daily allowances on packaging.  Clearer labelling will be needed and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland will have a role to play in this regard.  We should expect food advertisements to feature similar information and standards as are available on other forms of advertisement.  For example, we often hear the words &ldquo;Enjoy alcohol responsibly&rdquo; at the end of advertisements for alcoholic drinks.  Food advertisements should feature words to the effect that people should consult the recommended daily allowance for the relevant products.</P>
        <P>In recent days, the issue of religion has been discussed.  In the United States one cannot use the words &ldquo;Happy Christmas&rdquo;.  Instead, one must say &ldquo;Happy Holidays&rdquo;.  On the other hand, the country has many commercial television channels dedicated to bible belt preaching.  We should not muddy the waters and become excessively politically correct.  Religions which do not promote themselves as superior or practice discrimination against other races, colours or creeds should not be precluded from advertising.  Common sense must prevail.</P>
        <P>I note Deputy Peter Kelly who is seated opposite was photographed on the set of &ldquo;The Tudors&rdquo;.  As a Deputy from County Wicklow, it would remiss of me not to welcome the provision on establishing an Irish film channel.  The broadcasting fund&rsquo;s remit should be extended to include the promotion of Irish culture through film.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance should extend section 4(3)(1), which deals with tax breaks in the film industry, to include film editing.  Once films are shot, the editing takes place in the United States where the big money is spent.  While film editing may not provide as much employment as the set and production side, it is a high cost element of film production.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Broadcasting Bill 2008 published on 14 May has been passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Broadcasting is an issue which covers many areas.  In today&rsquo;s technologically advanced world the term &ldquo;broadcasting&rdquo; can mean many things, whether television, radio, the Internet or other means of communication.  Broadcasting contributes greatly to all our lives, informing us of everyday events and ensuring we are in touch with the world around us.  I hazard a guess that every Deputy present encountered some form of broadcasting almost as soon as he or she woke this morning.  One of the first things we do is switch on the radio to listen to the news, get the weather forecast or hear the traffic information.  </P>
        <P>Broadcasting affects most aspects of our lives.  It covers a wide range of topics: entertainment, education, news, music and sport.  The fact that it is so all-encompassing means that this legislation is important.  It is an interesting and varied topic for discussion and I am sure every Member will have his or her own take on it.</P>
        <P>Broadcasting has made our world a smaller and more intimate place.  Due to its importance in our everyday lives, it is important we have certain regulations in place and certain boundaries that cannot be broken.  I am not talking about a Big Brother style of regulation, but we must have some regulations in place.  This legislation deals with issues around the format, structure and model of broadcasting, dealing with publicly funded broadcasters and those not funded directly by the licence fee but through commercial advertising.  We need a public broadcaster, but there is a difference between a public broadcaster and a State broadcaster.  A point that must be made is that a public broadcaster in receiving a licence fee has an extra duty or obligation to the viewing public.  This is only fair and as it should be.</P>
        <P>By and large, RTE does a good job and fulfils its public broadcast remit in most cases.  One particular area where it excels is in its coverage of sport.  It keeps the nation in touch with the GAA championships, our soccer and rugby teams to name but a few.  Viewers look forward to watching &ldquo;The Sunday Game&rdquo; every week.  Sport is an important aspect of all our lives and the more sport we play and the more our young people engage in it, the better for the people and the country.  Playing sport, as the saying goes, keeps one &ldquo;healthy in mind and spirit&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>RTE, TG4 and TV3, the television stations based in Ireland, are probably among the best there is.  I find that in most places I go invariably it is one of these channels that tends to be on.  People seldom switch to outside broadcasting channels from anywhere else in Europe because there is no need to do so with the standard and quality of the broadcasters and programming provided by RTE, TG4 and TV3.  Furthermore, most people tell me that the soccer coverage on RTE consists of analysis that is second to none on these islands.</P>
        <P>Similar to points previously mentioned in this debate, I do not believe the public broadcaster should be a direct extension of the State in its form and functions.  It is appropriate that the public broadcaster is regulated in the same way as other independent commercial broadcasters which also should have a clear public service remit.  The advent of commercial broadcasters is to be welcomed, as they provide competition, but I would be wary of certain commercial broadcasters transmitting content that is largely imported.  They may argue that they are not privy to a licence fee and that is a fair point, but some commercial channel content is not up to the required standard we expect in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I welcome what the Bill is trying to achieve.  It will ensure regulation of the broadcasting industry which is growing year by year.  We need to ensure broadcasting can flourish and that there is regulation to ensure quality and access across the spectrum of public, private, independent and community broadcasting.  Effectiveness of regulation is an important issue.  The Bill will lead to the establishment of a new broadcasting authority, with which I will deal shortly.</P>
        <P>I take the opportunity to make the point that the news and entertainment content of the national radio stations is second to none.  We have independent radio stations in the Longford-<Col N="262"/>Westmeath region that do an excellent job.  Shannonside Radio, an independent radio station, is based in Longford town.  It has a large listenership.  It transmits &ldquo;The JF Show&rdquo; presented by Joe Finnegan every morning.  He is known the length and breadth of the region.  The station&rsquo;s news staff provide comprehensive, factual news coverage on an hourly basis.  If people want to know what is happening in my constituency, they listen to Shannonside Radio.  I pay tribute to Maryclaire Greally and her staff in the station&rsquo;s newsroom because if there is a tragic event, they know how to handle it sympathetically and are very understanding.  The station provides a great service.  At the press of a button people in the region can find out everything that is happening around them.</P>
        <P>This is important legislation that will affect people culturally.  Television is a medium used by them every day to access news and views from around the world.  What they see on the box in the corner heavily influences them and what they hear debated on radio shows every day will form the opinions they express in the pub that night.  We cannot underestimate the importance of broadcasting.  When I spoke to people and was told about some news story, on asking if it was true, they responded, &ldquo;Yes, that is true.&rdquo;  On asking them how they had come to know about it, they responded, &ldquo;I saw it on television or I heard it on radio.&rdquo;  People believe what they see on television and what they hear on radio.  Broadcasters have a responsibility, as we do in our jobs and professions, to be truthful, honest and factual.  Some say that at times what is broadcast is fiction.  If that happens, perhaps the broadcaster should indicate at the start of the following show that the item broadcast was fiction.</P>
        <P>This legislation is modernising.  It establishes the broadcasting authority of Ireland which will assume the functions of the existing Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and take on a number of new roles and responsibilities.  It will have two statutory boards, the contracts award committee and the compliance committee.  It will have overall responsibility for the organisation in preparing codes and rules for broadcasters.  The compliance committee will be responsible for ensuring that all broadcasters, whether public or private, comply with the conditions of their licences and with the standards set down in the broadcasting codes.</P>
        <P>The differing views regarding the Bill should be taken on board.  Society in 21st century Ireland is evolving.  Broadcasting is one of the most changeable aspects of that society and the Bill reflects that reality.</P>
        <P>The views of all players in the broadcasting sector, particularly Screen Producers Ireland, should be taken into account.  I visited Ardmore Studios on Tuesday last and one could not but be impressed by the fact that it is a hive of activity.  I was struck by the high standard and variety of the sets in use there.  Ardmore Studios, which is involved in both film and television production, is a great advertisement for Ireland.  Morgan O&rsquo;Sullivan, the legendary broadcaster, gave us a tour of the studios and we visited the set of &ldquo;The Tudors&rdquo;, a programme which is currently showing in 70 countries and which is a great advertisement for Ireland.  The market is out there and it is merely a matter for us to advertise Ireland as a centre of film, television and radio production.  In the past, many of the best people in the world have worked in this business in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government agreed in June 2007 contains a range of commitments in respect of broadcasting.  Of those commitments, the following will be delivered upon or facilitated through the Bill before the House: the Broadcasting Bill will be enacted to ensure a comprehensive, modern framework of law for the sector; the broadcasting authority of Ireland will be established; there will be a speedy right to reply to those who have been defamed in radio or television programmes; and work will be carried out in conjunction with the various <Col N="263"/>broadcasting organisations and interested parties to review rules relating to the advertising of junk food aimed at young people, with a view to phasing out such advertising.</P>
        <P>Difficulties may arise in respect of the latter commitment, particularly in the context of people watching television channels over which we have no control.  Irish television stations should come together with Screen Producers Ireland to develop and produce more programmes for children which can be broadcast at times when they watch television.  Screen Producers Ireland is extremely enthusiastic in this regard, particularly as it possesses the relevant expertise.  I encourage the television stations to contact them to see whether it might be possible to produce more children&rsquo;s programmes.  I did not use the word &ldquo;better&rdquo; when referring to such programmes because I know, following my visit to Ardmore Studios, that there can be no doubt about the high standard of production which takes place there.</P>
        <P>Under its programme, the Government is also committed to placing reviews of the licence fee on a statutory basis and ensuring that RTE supports broadcasting to the Irish community abroad, which is extremely important.  When I visited London, Birmingham and Manchester in the past to attend annual Longford association dinner dances and other functions, I discovered that even though many Irish people live in England, they leave their hearts, souls and people back in Ireland.  All these individuals indicated their desire to watch Irish television or listen to Irish radio.  It is not the case that RTE should support broadcasting to the Irish community abroad merely for the sake of doing so, it should also do so in order that these people will not be deprived of seeing and hearing the best television and radio programmes produced anywhere in the world.</P>
        <P>The Government is also committed to ensuring a fair and competitive environment for the independent TV and radio sector and working with the Houses of the Oireachtas and other local authorities to introduce programming that will carry live feeds of Oireachtas business and local council meetings, where practicable.</P>
        <P>In April 1999, Ireland received notification from the European Commission that it had received a complaint relating to grant aid paid to RTE and TG4.  The matter was discussed with the Commission and the Government gave certain commitments which are to be implemented by way of the Broadcasting Bill.  These commitments relate to proposed changes in the supervisory framework for public service broadcasting in particular.  They include the provision of independent advice to the Minister on the funding of public service broadcasting on an annual and five-year basis by the BAI, sectoral impact and public value tests for certain new public service broadcasting activities, clarity in Irish law around the remit and entrustment of public service broadcasters and various other oversight matters to be dealt with by the BAI.  Ireland also committed to endeavour to enact the Broadcasting Bill 2008 by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The BAI will be a new regulatory authority and will replace the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  It will assume responsibility for the key existing roles of the BCI and the BCC and will take on a range of new functions.  In particular, it will have new functions in respect of public service broadcasters.  The BAI will consist of the authority and two independent statutory boards, namely, the contracts award committee and the compliance committee.  The authority will have overall responsibility for the strategic direction of the organisation, as well as tasks such as preparing codes and rules for broadcasters, administering the broadcasting fund, certain oversights in respect of public service broadcasters and the setting and collection of a levy on the sector to fund its costs.  The contracts award committee will have the role of licensing independent commercial and community broadcasters, such as local radio stations or digital television providers.  The compliance committee will have the separate role of ensuring that all broadcasters, public or private, com<Col N="264"/>ply with their licence conditions and with the standards set out in the broadcasting codes and rules.</P>
        <P>The BAI will have nine board members, five of whom will be appointed by the Government after nomination by the Minister and four will be appointed by Government after nomination by the Minister on the advice of the joint Oireachtas committee which deals with broadcasting matters.  The joint committee may appoint a panel for the purposes of such appointments.  The joint committee is comprised of members from all sides.  Great interest is always shown when we appoint boards or reappoint people to them.  As a member of the relevant committee, I assure the House that everything will be transparent and above board.  Members are welcome to attend our meetings at any time and if they wish to make nominations, they should do so at their convenience.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill, which will bring about a number of changes.  I wish to focus on advertising relating to religious orders, churches etc.  This matter has been touched upon by previous speakers but I wish to comment on it in detail.  The Bill represents an opportunity for the Minister to deal with this matter once and for all.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Deputy Doyle and others referred to the importance of broadcasting, the media and so forth.  As politicians, we often miss out and do not get to watch enough television or keep up to date with the various programmes that are shown.  We are often out of touch with what is happening.  Television is an education because there is so much on it.  When I was on holidays with a few friends they were chatting about different television programmes.  I was out of the conversation because I did not know what was going on.  One of my friends told me to go away for a week and watch television and come back and we would have a conversation.  That is how important it is.  They were all talking about television and I could not join in because we do not get to watch enough of it here.  That can be good, but we miss out on certain educational programmes.  There is a lot on television, not only on radio and in the newspapers.  It is important to monitor and keep a close eye on the whole area.</P>
        <P>This Bill also deals with the independence and licensing of local radio stations and will help speed up the process of re-licensing in respect of which there were lengthy delays for some stations.  Politicians, particularly those from rural or semi-rural areas, know perhaps more than anybody else the importance of local radio stations.  The service they provide, often on low budgets, is unbelievable, although some of them have been sold for high prices lately.  The staff are not paid the top wages they might get elsewhere but they provide an excellent service reporting on a wide range of subjects including sports, community events, politics, deaths and so on.  All areas are covered and it is an excellent service to the community at a time when life is so fast-moving and we spend so much time in our cars that radio is probably the best way we have of keeping in touch with local events and what is going on around us.  The real benefit of local radio is in keeping the community spirit alive.  The radio station in my area is LMFM.  Shannonside also covers part of my area.  Along with many others they do an excellent job.  Ministers and Deputies get to speak on many different local radio stations which are to be commended, protected and encouraged.</P>
        <P>In the debate over the past couple of days we have discussed the issue of D&aacute;il TV.  I am a member of the committee which has been discussing that with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has done much work in this area and is very genuine about it and wants it to work.  There is merit in the idea.  We should examine what is happening in other countries.  Our near neighbour televises its Parliament on <Col N="265"/>a regular basis in an interesting way.  That is a standard to which we should aspire.  Perhaps when we go digital in 2012 or 2013 D&aacute;il TV can be part of the changeover.</P>
        <P>In the meantime we must work with our national stations, TV3, RTE and so on, to try to produce a different type of political programme that might be more interesting.  People are interested in politics.  It is part of their everyday lives.  It must, however, be presented in an interesting way that will keep them awake.  Putting a programme on at midnight in a not very exciting format will not keep people&rsquo;s interest.  They will not stay up to watch a 40 minute programme, which itself gives a good summary of what happens here, when they must get up at 5.30 a.m. or 6.30 a.m. to drive for hours in traffic.  Midnight is too late.  I do not understand why broadcasters do that.  Perhaps they do not realise just how interested people are in politics.  It is not just that politicians believe people are interested in them.  People are genuinely interested in politics.  The proof of this is shown by the fact that when we go down the country every year for our party meeting to discuss various issues, telephone calls to my office drop by approximately 80%.  People know we are away because they are tuned in, listening to various programmes.  Likewise when we were cooped up here for a couple of days discussing the economic situation and the new regulations for banks, telephone calls to my office dropped by nearly 90%.  Again people knew we were busy.  They knew that because they were following events on radio, television and the media.  They are interested in following what is going on.  However, it must be presented succinctly, in a way they can absorb it, and at a suitable time.  We should work on that over the next couple of years before we commit to spending a massive amount of money on D&aacute;il TV.  When I say a massive amount of money, the figure is probably not that high.  It is approximately &euro;1 million, not as high as one might expect, because much good work was done to try to get a good price.  We should examine the issue over a couple of years and try to address it through getting good programmes.  The debate between the American Presidential candidates was a good example of such programming.  People seem to like interactive programmes such as &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; with somebody guiding the debate.  The Minister is considering that approach in regard to D&aacute;il TV but we must work with existing television programmes at the moment.</P>
        <P>I will turn to advertising.  I want to deal mainly with what has happened here over the past couple of years in the context of religion.  I do not believe it is what people wanted to happen.  In 1999 <i>The Irish Catholic</i> newspaper had an advertisement banned from the airwaves for stating that it connects the teaching of the Church with the issues of the day.  It did not state what those teachings were or whether they were good, bad or indifferent.  In 2000 there was legislation that was meant to address the issue.  It was simply a statement of what <i>The Irish Catholic</i> does and what anyone would expect a newspaper of this sort to do.</P>
        <P>As a result of that ban the Oireachtas, partly at the behest of Deputy Enda Kenny, amended the broadcasting legislation to permit the advertising of religious publications or the holding of religious events.  However, the amendment did not work as intended because in 2002 <i>The Irish Catholic</i> had another advertisement banned, this time for mentioning a feature series entitled &ldquo;The Good the Church Does&rdquo;.  It was about the work of organisations such as Crosscare, a Dublin diocesan welfare agency.  Ireland is among the most restrictive regimes in the Western world with regard to religious advertising whereas in the US there is a free-for-all.  Even in secular-minded Britain the legal environment in which religious advertisers operate is more liberal and more reasonable than it is here.  Northern Ireland is governed by UK legislation in this regard.  In 2003 our regulator saw fit to ban an advertisement from an interdenominational group called Power to Change.  It was about the power of Jesus to change one&rsquo;s life.  The message was overtly religious but UTV allowed it to air while we did not.</P>
        <P>Our legislation and the way in which it is interpreted by organisations such as the Broadcasting Complaints Commission are to blame for this state of affairs.  The legislation is too strict <Col N="266"/>and is made worse by being interpreted too strictly.  For evidence of this we should note that the legislation prevents both advertisements directed towards a religious end and advertisements directed towards a political end.  I will return shortly to the issue of advertisements directed towards a political end.  The ban on advertisements directed towards a political end is not used by the BCC to prevent secular newspapers from advertising either their sale or their content, and this content is often highly political.  Why this double standard?  One reason may be that we have become unduly suspicious of religion, regarding it as a likely cause of sectarianism and division.  Politics can also be divisive, but we do not seem to regard it with the same suspicion.  Is there a prejudice at work here.  Is this why we strictly interpret legislation with regard to religious publications but not with regard to publications with religious content.  Perhaps the attitude of suspicion which we bring to religion stems partly from the history of Northern Ireland which, of course, has been scarred by sectarianism.  If that is so, why did the Northern Ireland authorities permit the Power to Change advertisements and we did not?  They would have reason to be much more sensitive in these matters than us and yet they were more liberal and more reasonable in this regard than we were.  It is worth stressing again that the advertisement for the Power to Change was much more overtly religious than either of the advertisements from <i>The Irish Catholic</i> which were banned, yet UTV allowed it to air.</P>
        <P>It seems we have attached an unreasonable fear to the matter of religious advertising in Ireland.  We seem to believe that if we allow one religious advertisement to air, no matter how innocent, we will have opened Pandora&rsquo;s box wide and will have to allow much more harmful advertisements on air.  This is why the recent Veritas advertisements for Holy Communion gifts such as rosary beads were banned even though their offence was simply to describe those gifts as spiritual gifts and to refer people to the Veritas website, which mentions the Catholic hierarchy.</P>
        <P>The attitude of some people, including the Minister, seems to be that there is a straight line from this kind of advertisement to advertisements by cults and religious fanatics.  We seem not to have the same fear in that regard to secular newspapers advertising their contents.  No one suggests that if we allow one of our recognised mainstream newspapers to advertise its political content, which we do, we will then be faced with advertisements for neo-Nazi publications.  The Minister needs to ease the extreme restrictions on advertising.  The fears that seem to motivate our current approach are unrealistic.  It is certainly unfair to ban mainstream organisations and publications from the airwaves out of fear of extremists gaining access to the airwaves as a result.  This draconian approach, which is not based on experience, means too many perfectly respectable organisations, which are and have been part of the fabric of our society for a very long time, are being hurt unnecessarily.   In the case of Veritas and <i>The Irish Catholic</i>, this almost amounts to a restraint on trade.  They are not given the same chance as everyone else to sell their wares.  It is reasonable to ask the Minister to ease the current restrictions on broadcasting religious advertisements.  If extremists thereby gain access to the airwaves, the legislation can be revisited.  This would be an innocent until proven guilty approach, as distinct from the current guilty until proven innocent attitude.  The Minister needs to set aside the unreasonable fears that motivate this attitude and give religious organisations the same freedom we offer other organisations.</P>
        <P>This is an open and multicultural country and we need to allow space for diverse religious beliefs.  We cannot control or fear everything.  Other speakers referred to Christmas and cribs.  We are taking a step too far.  Advertising merely gives people the opportunity to make choices.  Nothing is being forced on them.  We need to grow up and deal with this multicultural and religiously diverse environment like mature adults.  We should be proud of our backgrounds <Col N="267"/>but draconian legislative measures can spoil that by fostering resentment.  As legislators, we have a duty to make this grey area more straightforward.</P>
        <P>It is a shame that we do not allow more extensive political advertising on television broadcasts because this could increase people&rsquo;s interest in politics.  Last Christmas, I spent some time in America, where I saw a wide variety of fun and interesting political broadcasts.  Some people might believe everything they see but that applies in respect of all advertising.  On Committee Stage we might discuss the possibility of opening up our rules on political advertising.  I am aware of the danger that people with money might take over but, as modern politicians, that is a risk we have to take.  Libertas spent a lot of money on the Lisbon referendum but we could also have availed of broadcasting opportunities.  It was difficult to get our points across on the treaty.  The best way of disseminating information would have been by means of radio and television rather than the print media.  With the exception of one or two programmes each week, we were unable to get our message across.</P>
        <P>Changes in this regard would not necessarily result in an increase in party politics because we could also educate people on politics in general.  We often assume that people know how political processes work but many of us here did not have a clue about political issues at local, national or European level before we got involved in politics.  I used to think councillors were paper figures because I was not involved in local politics before running for office.  I did not study local governance in school, although that subject is now touched upon.  Many people who came through our educational system never had an opportunity to learn about local, national or European politics.  We have a duty to give them such an opportunity.  If we give them the information they need, they will be better able to engage with politicians of all parties.  They need to learn why certain decisions are made because we often appear to decide incorrectly.  If people understood the system, however, they would better understand our decisions.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about programming aimed at children and, specifically, advertisements for junk food and alcohol.  Those involved in the drinks industry have begun to work with the Government on bringing change to this area but problems remain.  I acknowledge that we can only control stations broadcasting from Ireland and cannot deal with Sky or other stations.  The simplest way to address this issue would be to advertise the dangers of alcohol as a counterbalance to pushing how wonderful it is or the nights out that can be had.  An equal amount of money should be spent on showing both negative and positive effects.  I am aware that the drinks industry pays a small levy into a fund which deals with alcohol problems.  This may represent a quick way to deal with the issue rather than introducing complicated legislation which might be difficult to monitor.</P>
        <P>I support the provisions for addressing the issue of junk food.  We should use the media to reach out to parents, who need help and advice on raising children.  It is difficult to do everything right by children in today&rsquo;s climate, whether in terms of food, drugs or alcohol, and the Government&rsquo;s help is needed.  A number of programmes currently broadcast deal with parenting, including one I watched this morning which offered advice from a parenting coach.  These programmes are useful and perhaps we need more of them.  Rather than trying to control advertisements, we should have a say in the dissemination of positive information that helps parents to raise children.  We cannot and should not force parenting courses upon them.  Many schools and communities offer such courses and the television offers similar opportunities in regard to eating and drugs.  We could use Irish made programmes to reach out to parents and, through cartoons, to children.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision for a dedicated film channel.  Over the past several years, a number of excellent films have been produced with the support of the Irish Film Board.  Many of these were made with low budgets and deal with serious issues such as racism, drugs, illness and <Col N="268"/>disabilities.  They have touched raw nerves.  They do not reach the audience they deserve, however, so I look forward to the establishment of this channel.  Films present further opportunities for disseminating messages.  I accept that films and programmes are made that do not give good messages but it is a matter of choice.  We should do everything we can to encourage our film industry.</P>
        <P>I welcome the many positive measures contained in this Bill.  However, we need to expand broadcasting in order to educate people and to develop the systems which Government and Opposition politicians and parents want.  Let us take advantage of this opportunity.  I encourage all those who are involved in the media to take the next step.  From speaking to people on the doorsteps, we get a good feeling for what they want and need.  Programming does not have to be flashy or colourful to be of good quality.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about this important Bill.  While driving one evening, I listened to a radio programme on the use of debate by the ancient Greeks, who formulated their thoughts in their heads until the advent of writing.  Socrates maintained that the act of writing changed the way he formulated his thoughts.  This argument developed further with the invention of the printing press, the typewriter and the computer.  All these developments help to change the way in which we formulate our thoughts and thus how we think.  Broadcasting is changing as we speak, with the advent of digital platforms and so on.  We are absolutely bombarded with information from all sides: television, radio, the Internet, iPhones and so on.  Technology is advancing by the day.  Somebody told me recently that there were only two types of computer: prototype and obsolete.  Things are moving that fast.  It is the same for all technology.  We are talking about a very powerful medium which has the ability to influence our culture and how we think.  It also has the power to change our outlook on life.  Many now depend on the media, television and radio broadcasting in particular, in forming their views of the world.</P>
        <P>More and more younger people are using websites such as Bebo and Facebook.  I have children who are very adept at this, although we monitor their use as best we can.  It is amazing that young people nowadays can communicate with each other in so many ways.  In the past parents knew where their children were, who they were with and so forth, but now they are in their bedrooms and with their mobile phones could be talking to anybody anywhere in the world.  It is similar for Bebo, Facebook, YouTube and other technologies.  Because of this we face major challenges.  It is not just television &mdash; there are other media too.</P>
        <P>Almost every Deputy who has spoken so far in the debate and whose contribution I have read or listened to has alluded to the power of advertising where children are concerned.  Advertising to children is a sensitive issue.  In some countries there are codes for such advertising.  This is something we need to debate in the House.  In Australia matters are very advanced.  There is a code called the Children&rsquo;s Code which states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Advertisements to children must not mislead or deceive children; must not be ambiguous; and must fairly represent, in a manner that is clearly understood by children: the advertised product; any features that are described or depicted in the advertisement and the need for any accessory parts.  Advertisements must not portray images or events which depict unsafe uses of a product ... [They] must not portray images or events in a way that is unduly frightening ... to children; and must not demean any person or group on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, age, sexual preference, religion or mental or physical disability.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, under the code, advertisements may not undermine parental authority and prices, if mentioned, must be presented in an accurate way which can be clearly understood.  If the <Col N="269"/>advertisement is for a competition, it must contain a summary of the basic rules.  The code also states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Advertisements must not be for, or relate in any way to, alcoholic drinks or draw any association with companies that supply alcoholic drinks . . . [They] should not encourage or promote an inactive lifestyle ...</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">We need to discuss such issues in the House.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note that in the United States the Children&rsquo;s Television Act was passed in 1990 with the aim of enhancing television&rsquo;s potential to teach the nation&rsquo;s children.  This brings me back to the influence of television.  The Act requires each television station that offers children&rsquo;s television programming in the United States to serve the educational and informational needs of children through its overall programming, including programming specifically designed to serve these needs, or core educational programming.  A central goal is to provide parents and other members of the public with greater information on educational television programmes.  Television stations should be mandated to show a certain number of educational programmes specifically geared towards children.  We all remember &ldquo;Sesame Street&rdquo; which was designed to help children who had problems with reading, letters and so on and was very entertaining, as well as educational.</P>
        <P>There are a few provisions in the Bill that I welcome, including those dealing with community radio.  There is a distinction between community radio and local radio.  Community radio is important from the point of view of citizenship.  We have heard a lot of talk from the Government and others on all sides of the House about active citizenship.  Community radio is a fantastic example of this.  It plays an essential part in generating interest and providing information on local events.  It is not for profit &mdash; it is run by local people for local people.  In my own area of Youghal, if I may be parochial, we have a fantastic community radio station on which many of us are asked to speak.  People really enjoy this.  I notice that 14 community radio stations are currently licensed in the State.  I call on the Minister to encourage and support these radio stations.  Part of the problem they have is finding a premises from which to broadcast.  CRAOL, the community radio forum, plays an important role by providing advice and support and as a forum for community radio.  However, I would like to see the Government take a far more active role in supporting community radio.  I am not speaking of local radio which is a commercial venture.  Community radio is run by local people for local people and is about local events.</P>
        <P>Part 6 of the Bill revises the mechanisms governing the award of contracts and provides for a new definition of community broadcasting.  It makes provision for temporary 100-day licences to be awarded to community radio stations.  The problem is how to fund a premises from which to broadcast.  This must be examined.  If this help and support could be provided &mdash; it would take very little &mdash; we would see an explosion in the number of community radio stations across the country, especially in view of the 100-day broadcasting licences.  The Minister has said this is designed to encourage the development of a much wider plurality of broadcasters, often working on a non-commercial community basis, which would be a major new step in broadcasting on this island.  I welcome this and encourage the Government to move on with it.</P>
        <P>Another welcome feature of the Bill is that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will be charged with preparing rules for broadcasters in respect of access to broadcasting services by persons with a hearing or sight impairment.  The Disability Act 2005 contains annual incremental targets for such content which public broadcasters must meet.  Targets, however, are still relatively low as, unfortunately, television services here are not very advanced in these areas.  I would like to see improvements in levels of accessibility, including subtitles, audio scripting, <Col N="270"/>signing and so on.  I know it is expensive and difficult, but it is very important for the people concerned.  I encourage the Government to move on with this.</P>
        <P>As I said, the Bill maintains the current system whereby television sets are licensed.  As broadcasting technology advances on an almost daily basis, we are moving towards an age in which many people use PCs, laptops, mobile phones and other devices to watch television and there does not seem to be any consideration of this in the Bill.  I am not saying there should or should not be, but we have had very little debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>When we were dealing with the Copyright and Related Rights Bill in 2000, there was an issue to do with televisions in hotels.  The question was whether royalties should be charged in respect of each television set in a hotel.  A decision was taken at the time that this would not happen and it was written into the legislation.  I note, however, that the Bill allows for a separate regime for television sets held at commercial premises to be set out in regulations.  I read the Minister&rsquo;s speech and many others by Members opposite and do not think anyone alluded to this.  My impression is that a television licence will be required for all devices capable of receiving a television signal.  Thus, if one has a guesthouse or hotel with a television set in each room, is it the case that from now on one will have to have a licence for each one?  That is how it appears.  I ask the Minister to make this clear in his response, because it is not clear at the moment.  Strangely, he did not allude to it in his speech.</P>
        <P>I welcome section 39 which requires all stations to broadcast a minimum level of news and current affairs programmes.  This is important.</P>
        <P>The provisions for redress in Part 4 are crucial.  The public complaints procedure avoids the courts, which is important.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the provisions encouraging the production of home produced programmes by RTE and local radio stations.  I stress that quality is important.  Some colleagues have mentioned some excellent home-produced programmes.  One person mentioned &ldquo;The Clinic&rdquo;, which is aired on Sunday evenings.  It is a way of highlighting many issues through drama.  At the end of the programme a message is broadcast stating that if people are concerned about an issue raised in the programme they can contact a specified body for advice and support, which is interesting.  I also welcome the establishment of audience councils.</P>
        <P>I have often said that the establishment of an Oireachtas channel will not work unless we change procedures here.  Yesterday we had the first meeting of the sub-committee dealing with D&aacute;il reform.  It was a positive meeting and I congratulate the Chief Whip on convening the meeting and being very positive and open.  I encourage all colleagues to have an open mind on how we might change the way we do business in the House.  While many things have been discussed over the years, very little has happened.  With the advent of digital television we will be able to present ourselves possibly 24 hours a day to the people.  The proceedings in committees, the D&aacute;il and Seanad Chambers, and possibly local authorities, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the European Parliament will be available to citizens at the touch of a button.  What they should see is interactive logical debate and discussion.  If a Member on this side of the House asks a Minister to give way for a question, the Minister should not see it as a personal attack but rather should welcome such an intervention and answer it if he or she can.  That is the kind of mindset we need to develop in the House.  It would make it far more interesting and interactive for everybody.</P>
        <P>I was very taken by Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s contribution.  He is always very informative and entertaining.  He said that the purpose of television is to educate, inform and entertain.  He made the distinction between those who watch television as consumers and those who watch as citizens.  There is a danger of broadcasting becoming very commercial.  There is no definition <Col N="271"/>of public service broadcasting in the Bill.  I ask what is public service broadcasting.  It is crucial to write that down.  I return to what I said initially about the ancient Greeks.  We should think about it first and then write down what public service broadcasting is.  Many of us have an image that it is something good and wholesome and we should all have it.  I would like to see a written definition included in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I agree with what many colleagues have said about religious broadcasting.  It is important to have freedom on the airwaves.  However, as mentioned by Deputy English, there are many bodies that are dangerous, including various cults etc.  We need to be careful not to open the door for those people.  I also have concerns about tarot cards etc.  Many people spend money on these so-called services and we need to be very careful in this regard.</P>
        <P>There will be a cost involved in establishing an Oireachtas channel.  Deputy Coveney mentioned a figure of &euro;750,000 per annum for broadcasting alone, which is sizeable.  In this day and age we need to be cognisant of costs.  People are asking whether it will be worth it and whether we can afford to spend that much money on it.  I understand a feasibility study is ongoing and we will have the report soon, shortly after which the decision will be made.  It is important to have a dedicated Oireachtas channel.  We need to engage with RTE in this regard.  When we visited the BBC and reviewed what is done there we discovered that it cross-advertises the BBC parliamentary channel.  The news programmes on BBC1 and BBC2 often remind viewers they can view the proceedings of parliament on the BBC parliamentary channel.</P>
        <P>Full broadcasts are different from edited highlights, about which we would all be very sensitive to ensure everybody gets fair play.  We need an editorial structure that is fair and it needs to be broadcast so that as many people as possible can receive it.  While the digital platform should allow that to be done, the cost will need to be reviewed.  Returning to what public service broadcasting is, I maintain that broadcasting the Oireachtas proceedings and local authority meetings is a public service and part of the licence fee should be ring-fenced for that purpose, otherwise it might be difficult to do.</P>
        <P>How we think, see the world and formulate our thoughts is influenced by the broadcast media and the newer technologies that are gaining momentum all the time.  Mention has been made of opinion polls.  If opinion polls are published close to an election it can influence people who might believe that if that is the way it is going they should also go that way.</P>
        <P>Bad news is always featured and good news is not highlighted so much.  When we see pictures and hear stories of drug taking and violence among young people, the impression might be given that everyone is taking drugs and abusing alcohol, but that is not the case.  The majority of young people do not misbehave.  However, the impression could be given that they do and that the country has gone to ruin.  There is a responsibility on broadcasters to ensure that in their code of conduct they reflect what is happening and show that the majority of young people are very responsible, good citizens, very bright, highly educated and know what is going on and are fantastic to engage with.  We need more of that portrayed in the media in the hope that that role model can be taken on by more young people and not the opposite, which seems to be the case.  Research from other countries indicates that if the negative is portrayed perpetually, people tend to go that way and believe that is the norm when it is not the case.</P>
        <P>I wish the Bill well through its Remaining Stages.  It is a very important and complicated Bill covering many important issues for us all.</P>

	<P>I welcome this opportunity to debate the role of broadcasting.  Ireland has a proud history in broadcasting here and in every corner of the world.  Some of the developments we have seen in recent years have been good and some not so good.  One of the best developments has been the creation of local radio stations.  In particular I mention my local radio station, Cork 103 FM.  It is an outstanding radio station and every citizen in County Cork as well as many in Kerry, Waterford and Tipperary tune into Cork 103 FM.  It has certainly served the people of the south west in an excellent fashion since it was formed.  It provides an excellent service to all the villages in the south-west region.</P>
        <P>When I started my political crusade in 1960, I relied chiefly on after-Mass church-gate meetings.  What a change has occurred in those 48 years.  All election campaigns are now aired on local radio, some on television and of course there is still the art of personal canvassing.  I am disappointed that the Bill does not propose to amend existing legislation to allow for responsible religious advertising or take account of the Private Members&rsquo; Bill published by my colleagues, Deputy Simon Coveney and Gay Mitchell, MEP.  I will be supporting amendments to be tabled on Committee Stage to remedy this situation and I hope the Minister of State has the common sense to table such amendments.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a proud history in broadcasting.  Independent broadcasting has never been as strong as it is today.  More than 63% of the population, or 2.208 million, tune into independent radio on a daily basis.  This indicates the number of people independent broadcasters connect with daily.  Given these figures, no one can disagree that independent radio is providing an invaluable public service for the people.</P>
        <P>The independent sector is growing.  There is at present one national television station, two national radio stations, three regional stations and 27 local stations throughout the country.  Added to these is a regional radio station preparing for its initial broadcasting date and multi-city licence and an easy listening service has been advertised.  This is before we begin to focus on digital radio.  The Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill launched by the Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on Wednesday, 14 May, and passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 25 June is broadly welcome.  There are, however, a few areas of concern.</P>
        <P>At present, independent commercial radio stations operate under a ten-year licence which is subject to open competition at the end of that period.  Section 67 of the Bill allows for the fast-tracking of radio licences, where the incumbent is the only group interested in broadcasting to the chosen franchise area.  Fast-tracking of an unchallenged licence is welcome as it reduces the radio station&rsquo;s costs of applying for a new licence and the regulatory costs involved in awarding it.  The fast-tracking system proposed under section 67(9) allows for a new licence which would not exceed seven years, rather than the normal ten-year term.  I welcome the amendment passed in the Seanad which increased the term of the fast-track licence from the originally proposed five years to seven.  However, there is a sound business and broadcasting case to be made for giving a licence for ten years, as usual, and not the seven years as proposed.  I appeal to the Minister of State to restore that seven year provision to ten.</P>
        <P>By significantly reducing the term of a licence, radio stations will not be able to run their businesses on a strategic long-term plan.  That will make it difficult to attract and retain talented staff or justify major long-term investments such as the acquisition of premises and equipment and staff training.  In essence, this is to punish the existing radio station for the lack of competition for its licence by significantly reducing the most valuable asset any broadcaster has, its licence.  It will serve to undermine certainty in future investment and broadcasting quality.</P>
        <P>Section 66 of the Bill properly makes fulsome provision to enable the new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to satisfy itself as to the suitability of an incumbent licence holder before it awards a licence under the fast-track provision in section 67.  The clear and unaccepted logic <Col N="273"/>of a ten-year term for a radio licence should not be upturned simply because there is no competitor.  I would like the term of an independent radio licence to remain at ten years, regardless of the number of groups which declare an interest in the licence.  The same widely accepted logic for a ten-year licence term apples, regardless of the fact that in some instances there may be no competition.</P>
        <P>Digital radio broadcasting will result in greater station choice for consumers, with an increase in the amount of available spectrum.  Digital broadcasting is in its infancy in Ireland.  Work is being done on the introduction of digital television on foot of the analogue switch off that has been mooted for 2012.  There is no talk of FM radio being switched off and as a result digital radio broadcasting for commercial stations has been put on the long finger.  In order for digital radio to be successful in Ireland it is vital that all radio broadcasters buy into the format, both independent and public service.  For commercial radio stations the most powerful form of encouragement is an extension of their broadcasting contracts, a fact that is recognised in the Bill.  A significant amount of financial and human resources will be required for the development of digital broadcasting.  Given that a return on this investment is not guaranteed, the contract extension of four years proposed in the Bill is insufficient to ensure that independent broadcasters will take the very significant risks involved and invest in the development of digital radio.  I would like to see a contract extension of not more than seven years for any radio station that invests in and gets involved with the development and potential implementation of digital radio broadcasting.</P>
        <P>The television station, Channel South, will commence broadcasting in November and will be available to homes in Cork city and county, Limerick city and county and areas of the Munster region, including parts of Kerry, Waterford, Clare and south Tipperary.  The channel will operate 24 hours a day and will have a range of locally focused programming at the heart of its schedule.  Central to this will be hourly news bulletins, the first time that television news will be focused exclusively in my south-western area.  The news bulletins may also be seen on websites once broadcasting begins.  This is significant progress as far as television is concerned.</P>
        <P>Local radio stations play an excellent role in conveying local news every morning from 8 a.m. until 12 o&rsquo;clock.  The public is very pleased with the service it is getting and I hope that any sinister parts of the Bill will be overruled and fine-combed.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Power, will do his best to ensure that happens.  Freedom of speech and freedom of news is essential for every individual.  It is a concept that must be maintained as long as there is demand for it in Ireland. The Minister of State does not have a big mountain to climb.  He must only accept a few amendments.  I have noted his wisdom, tenacity and courage since he entered the House in 1981.  He will rise to the occasion and deliver the goods I have advocated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation which primarily sets up and gives power to a new body called the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  This was first proposed by Deputy Michael D. Higgins when he was in Cabinet in the 1990s and it has taken a long time to introduce this legislation.  The authority will be run by a new board comprising nine members.  Four of the appointments will be scrutinised by an Oireachtas committee.  While that is welcome, I fail to understand why all nine appointments should not be scrutinised.  However, that at least four will be scrutinised to ensure they comply with proper structures and have something to offer to the broadcasting system is a breakthrough.  Two statutory committees will also be appointed and a number of their members will also have to appear before the Oireachtas committee, which is positive.  However, I urge the Minister to re-examine this provision during the passage to the Bill to consider properly scrutinising all nine members of the authority&rsquo;s board.  I do not suggest people <Col N="274"/>nominated by the Minister for political reasons lack ability but the operation of the authority is of extreme importance and must be seen to be above politics and properly scrutinised.</P>
        <P>The broadcasting codes will be extremely important and the legislation provides for codes that will ensure news and other reports are done properly.  It also makes clear that broadcasters must present news in an objective and impartial manner without any expression of its own views.  It provides for a minimum period to be allocated for news and current affairs programming.</P>
        <P>Northern Sound, my local radio station, was taken over by Radio Kerry recently and, as a result, did not retain the local board of management structure.  For commercial reasons, the new management has curtailed the local news content in the early morning.  With my constituency colleagues from all parties, I used the early morning programme to discuss issues and people listened during their breakfast or on their way to work.  However, that facility is no longer available and is a major fault.  I do not take away from the personnel in the newsroom at the station because this was an administrative decision which curtails the value of the new structure.  Most local people listen to programmes on other radio stations now.  A cost may attach to the new structure but it does not provide a benefit.  I will meet senior station executives next Monday when they will officially open new state-of-the-art studios in Monaghan town.</P>
        <P>The Bill will deal with the restriction of junk food advertising.  I cannot say too much about this because, unfortunately, in my younger days I consumed as much junk food as anybody and that did not pay off in the long term because I have health problems such as diabetes that I may not have had if I had not been so fond of chip shops and other outlets.  I am extremely disturbed that the legislation does not contain a provision to curtail the advertising of alcohol.  I have raised the issue umpteen times in the House and the previous Taoiseach made many promises in this regard.  He said the industry had guaranteed it would act on the issue and that he would monitor what was happening.  However, the abuse of alcohol by young people is a major issue.  Alcohol is a drug and consumption leads to abuse of other drugs.  I urge the Minister to make an amendment to the legislation before it is too late to make sure the advertising of alcohol is addressed.  Such a provision has been promised for years in intoxicating liquor legislation and so on.  Since the Minister has decided to deal with the junk food issue, he should also address the abuse of alcohol.</P>
        <P>I welcome the redress provisions in the legislation.  The right to reply is important and my local radio station is extremely good in this regard.  Recently, an individual, without knowing fully what he was dealing with, accused me on that station of not understanding an issue in this House and talked about codswallop.  Many of my constituents went wild about the comments made but I was given the right to reply, which I appreciated.  It is important that a right of reply be provided.  A number of years ago another individual went on local radio and made various accusations against me without foundation.  I did not pursue it further at the time, which I rued afterwards, but it is important that this provision be stitched into the legislation.  Ordinary viewers and listeners should have the right to reply.  This should not be similar to the provision applying to newspapers which sometimes print an apology in the corner of the fourth page relating to a front page story a few weeks earlier.  On radio and television the right to reply should be provided during the same programme and for the same duration as the original accusation broadcast.</P>
        <P>Community and commercial broadcasting is important.  Northern Sound started off very much as a community-based organisation.  The churches, the GAA, the co-operatives and others owned a share in it.   However, broadcasting is not simple and, as time passed, they found that an organisation such as this must be run on a commercial basis.  Good community radio structures are in place in other parts of the country, which I encourage.  It is important that <Col N="275"/>young people in particular have the opportunity to speak their minds on their local radio stations.  Local radio, the Joe Duffy show and others have a significant role to play in how people&rsquo;s rights are brought forward in a constructive way.  At times, some believe that they go over the top, but they give locals and people with problems the opportunity to have issues dealt with at other levels.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In this context, I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s proposal of an Oireachtas broadcasting structure.  Years ago, it was stated that only those who could not sleep &mdash; other problems were mentioned &mdash; watched &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, itself structured on what a single individual in the media believed was important on that day.  It is good that people, particularly the elderly and those with disabilities, can see something of the House&rsquo;s workings on Wednesday and Thursday mornings.  Had this debate appeared live on television, more people would have been involved.  Broadcasting would force our organisation to become more relevant and to change the procedures for matters on the Adjournment, Standing Order 32 notices and so on, allowing for more interaction between Ministers and ordinary Members.  As Deputy Stanton stated, it is important to put a direct Oireachtas channel in place and to have continual comments concerning it on the main stations so as to encourage people to tune into debates.</P>
        <P>Last week showed people the House&rsquo;s relevance.  When matters are going well, ordinary people make out that the Houses are irrelevant.  When the banking crisis arose, however, we were the only people who could make decisions that would make a difference to living standards.  We might not have been very good in this regard previously.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the establishment of a new channel, it is vital that our debates become more relevant, lively and participative.  Question Time is staid.  A Minister speaks for a certain number of minutes while the questioner gets scarce opportunity to ask a supplementary question.  Such times should be better structured with quicker, sharper, more relevant and more realistic answers.</P>
        <P>The proposal for a film channel is important.  Recently, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, was a guest of honour at Annaghmakerrig.  During his visit to Annaghmakerrig House, I sat beside some of the people who write the storylines for RTE television programmes and others.  It was good that he had the opportunity to meet such people and to learn of their interests and backgrounds.  It was equally good that we in County Monaghan, through the generosity of the Tyrone Guthrie Centre, provided the house for the arts and the industry in general, allowing people to relax and to do great work there.</P>
        <P>Like those who attended the house, I welcome the inclusion of the arts and films in the Bill.  It is a concern that, in the current economic situation, the arts might suffer.  Annaghmakerrig House, the theatre in Castleblayney and so on are working on tight budgets.  I hope that they will not be the victims of a difficult situation.  How much time have I remaining?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude on my local radio stations, in particular the one close to the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s heart, LMFM.  It covers the south of my constituency in County Monaghan.  Northern Sound, linked with ShannonSide, covers the rest of the county.  These stations have been invaluable in providing everyone with an opportunity to have a say.  ShannonSide-Northern Sound has the &ldquo;Joe Finnegan Show&rdquo;, which addresses all sorts of issues from 9 a.m. until midday or so.  Noel Walsh and others are on later in the afternoon and J. P. Graham leads the sports team.  It is fantastic that club games are covered on local radio.  Older people who have been interested in sports for all of their lives can sit in their corner chairs and hear about what has happened to the clubs they love so much or listen to games minute-by-minute.</P><Col N="276"/>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding religious broadcasting, the Reverend Jean Mackerel runs a programme on Northern Sound late on Sunday nights and there is a religious service in the morning.  This also occurs on national radio stations and so on.  Religious broadcasting is vital.  People in cars, homes and hospitals and elderly people who cannot go to church services, masses and so on have the opportunity to spend a quiet hour with their religions.  Given the importance of this situation continuing, we should not be shy about it.  Religion is important, although it has suffered from problems in recent years.  Due to religious scandals in all churches, young people saw an excuse not to attend.  Perhaps for this reason there is so much suicide and so on.  The Bill should ensure that religious broadcasting of all churches gets priority and is assured.  We should not apologise for the right to broadcast for our religious groups and to ensure that they get their fair share.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill in general.  As Deputy Sheehan stated, amendments will be tabled to it.  I hope that our amendments will be considered constructively and, where possible, accepted during the debate.  I also hope that the Bill emerges as the best possible legislation, as it has been awaited for a long time.  It should serve to better broadcasting for many years.  The television licence and other issues will be dealt with by our spokesperson and I will not address the technical details of that.  The station cannot live without funding and neither can the smaller broadcasting stations.  They should all get a fair crack of the whip.  I support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</NameTxt>
	<P>I register agreement with three points made by Deputy Crawford.  This is legislation that should be matured rather than rushed through the House.  That would allow us to take on board the different points made and a really good Bill will result.  I endorse Deputy Crawford&rsquo;s praise of LMFM.  I was interviewed on the station two or three times even though it is far removed from the part of the country I represent.  I have fond memories of the visit to Annaghmakerrig House.  It is an exceptionally fine facility that does a real service to the artistic and writing community in a wonderful setting.  I will do my best to protect it in the coming years from any harsh economic winds that may blow.</P>
        <P>The context of my contribution is one of deep appreciation of the service that our national and local stations provide.  By and large I regard them as excellent.  When discussing topics foreign, they mediate the outside world through Irish eyes.  One of the relatively recent innovations was the introduction of Lyric FM.  I am not sure what I would do without it on long journeys around the country.  Public service broadcasting is a concept I warmly support and believe has its place, complemented by commercial broadcasting but not displaced by it.  It plays a major role in supporting arts and culture in terms of publicity and discussing exhibitions, books and broadcasting concert performances.  Arts and culture would be in a poorer place if there was no public service broadcasting.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, which is to be replaced by a more comprehensive authority under this Bill, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  This has been helpful in my area in respect of strengthening community radio.  When I came into electoral politics in 2002, the community radio station in Tipperary was in a difficult situation, with an uncertain future.  The commission helped it, putting it back on its feet and it is a thriving station, amalgamated with Cashel Community Radio by consent.  The regime now operating is beneficial to community radio.  Many people rely on local radio.</P>
        <P>There were worries in Northern Ireland that listeners might no longer be able to receive RTE when medium wave was phased out.  There has not been a peep out of anyone since the change was made.  Long wave radio provides very good coverage, as far as I can tell, over the island of Britain and in Northern Ireland.  I was on holiday in the west highlands of Scotland <Col N="277"/>and for the first time in my life I could hear RTE clearly without having to juggle the radio and put it close to my ear.  The change has improved the coverage and dissemination of RTE rather than diminishing it.</P>
        <P>When I was a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission we discussed an Oireachtas channel.  I would welcome a broadly based channel that would cover Oireachtas proceedings as well as those of other elected assemblies or quasi-parliamentary fora.  On days the D&aacute;il and Seanad are not sitting, for example, it could broadcast bodies such as the National Forum on Europe or the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body public sessions.  There are many people, though I am not saying a majority or anything remotely like it, who take an interest in our parliamentary and political life and they would like to have far more access than is possible at present when there are only news broadcasts of something particularly politically newsworthy or &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; very late at night.  An Orangeman said to me that he liked watching &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; and found it the best cure for insomnia.</P>
        <P>There are serious gaps in the coverage possible under the present arrangements.  When I was in the Seanad, nine times out of ten the only material covered was the Order of Business.  There are some very good debates in the Seanad but none was covered, except rarely.  Adjournment debates in this House, such as those last night, often cover matters of considerable topical interest.  The two matters to which I replied last night were flooding in Newcastle West and the future of Malin and Valentia stations.  These would be of interest to the public but there is no possibility of them being shown on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; because the debate takes place too late.  A parliamentary channel could also cover the UN General Assembly on occasion.  Four committees cannot be shown so they would have to be staggered in some way.  The channel should be broadly conceived.</P>
        <P>I express disappointment, probably felt by all Members, at the way a few journalists and broadcasters systematically denigrate this House and its proceedings on a generalised basis.  A very well known columnist and broadcaster yesterday wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The D&aacute;il has relevance only in the election of a Taoiseach &mdash; after that it is a waste of time.  No debates of any consequence, no decision of any consequence, no input of any consequence.  No accountability of any consequence.  No scrutiny of a Bill that could destroy the country.  For the reality is the legislative branch of Government is a failure.</P>

	<P>Did the Minister of State ring him?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I regard those sentiments as untrue and deplorable but, alas, not totally untypical of one or two commentators.  One would think they might pay closer attention to what goes on in this House but they obviously do not as they are so dismissive.  I often have the feeling that these comments are made by people who are, no doubt, brilliant journalists but they have a side that shows politicians <i>manqu&eacute;s.  </i>Obviously, if they were elected to this House they would have a less dismissive attitude to what goes on here.</P>
        <P>We do not have in this country, or in any other country that I can observe, government by assembly.  The only experiment in government by assembly was in the early years of the French Revolution when there was no government, only opposition, and that was fairly disastrous.  A lot of the business may be dull from a general point of view, particularly for those who live or die by TAM ratings, who need something that is relatively sensational, who like to be perverse and in a minority of one.  What is the alternative to some variation on a parliamentary system of democracy?  Presumably, it is some form of enlightened despotism or dictatorship.  To paraphrase Churchill, the system of democracy is bad but every other system is worse.  There may be a lot in that.</P><Col N="278"/>
        <P>There is also a denigration of politics by some people, in particular those with a right wing agenda.  That agenda goes roughly &ldquo;the less government, the less regulation, the better&rdquo;.  The events of the past few weeks have demonstrated that the State has a vital protective role in providing a safety net and that exaggerated market philosophy has proved to be a disaster.  We should stand up for the notion of public service and not always take the view that it is inferior, inefficient and incompetent and that private provision is always better or best.  Some of those who denigrate the State do it because they want to grab a share of quasi-monopoly profits.</P>
        <P>It is important that there is an arm&rsquo;s length relationship between the broadcasters and Government.  In case I sound as if I blame the journalistic profession, there is also the type of politician in all parties who essentially wants to suppress criticism by the media, who takes the view that the Government should take in hand RTE or this or that organ of opinion and ruthlessly sort them out.  I see absolutely no merit in that philosophy.  We live in a democracy of argument and debate.  To be fair, one of the good things about RTE, though perhaps some colleagues may disagree, is that nobody could say it is like some of the Italian broadcast media, for instance, under the thumb of the Government, or that it is Radio or TV Fianna F&aacute;il on all channels.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The other issue I wish to discuss is the question of balance.  It is primarily for the RTE Authority and, beyond that, the new broadcasting authority to ensure that balance is provided.  Generally speaking, this should not be the role of Governments or politicians or parties.  There are people who ring journalists and broadcasting channels regularly to complain of bias of this or that sort.  I have always tried to restrain myself from the temptation to do that.  I do not like the idea of pressure on broadcasters but I believe that in certain situations there is a need for responsibility.  One can argue in the case of popular phone-in shows that they give people the chance to let off a lot of steam and that they provide a valuable safety valve in a democracy.  In the type of financial situation that we have been in over the past few weeks I believe it is important that the broadcast media are not used to spread what may be a self-fulfilling panic.  If one broadcasts the fears of somebody who says he or she is taking money out of this place or that place and afterwards many other people go and do just that, it can be said that the person was right because of subsequent actions.  There is a serious danger of exacerbating a situation.  We all know cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Was that the man the Minister phoned?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;where we have to be restrained in commentary.  It is as if a person used freedom of speech to shout in this House or in a crowded place, &ldquo;Fire, fire.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The question of balance also cropped up in reference to the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Obviously, I cannot fault in any way RTE or other broadcasting stations for fulfilling their statutory responsibilities.  I have serious reservations, however, concerning the McKenna <Col N="279"/>judgment.  As somebody from the party opposite put it to me, the leader of Fine Gael got only as much coverage in that debate as a spokesperson from Sinn F&eacute;in, despite the vast disproportion between party strengths.  It seems that an inherent weakness in that judgment, abstracting from it the question of the Lisbon treaty, is that it means that no matter how universal the consensus is on a topic, anyone who is against it is entitled to equal coverage, even if that person does not represent many people.  It is, in other words, a golden opportunity for relatively small groups or parties to gain a higher profile.  I suspect that in some cases this is done somewhat cynically, that the judgment is seen as an opening and an opportunity.</P>
        <P>After the Lisbon treaty referendum most of us wanted, in principle, to have a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  I am not surprised there was a pause for thought on the grounds that it would greatly amplify the position of those who would have a minority view.  I consider that while respecting the voice and decision of the people, the price is considerable and there has been considerable damage to our interests as a result.  I do not believe that being in that position has made the last few weeks any easier.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by making two or three points on religious broadcasting.  I fully endorse Deputy Crawford&rsquo;s comments on the value and importance of religious broadcasting both at national and local community levels.  Second &mdash; I speak from a minority point of view &mdash; I wish people would leave the Angelus alone.  A former archbishop of the Church of Ireland stated that he had no problem whatsoever with it and that is the authoritative view.  While we might not necessarily understand its full religious significance, that does not matter as there must be an attitude of live and let live.</P>
        <P>I may depart from consensus in respect of my final point.  I have reservations about unrestricted religious advertising.  In the past, Ireland had problems of proselytism and people should not underestimate the attractiveness a wide open system would have for proselytisers of a particular evangelical type.  I have no problem with noticeboard-type bulletins.</P>
        <P>While this may simply be my personal perspective, religion is not a soap powder and consequently I dislike the idea of it being placed at the level of other consumer products.  While I accept the converse point that churches must use modern methods of communication like anyone else, I would like to think the churches are a little way above the marketplace.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important for Ireland to have a strong national broadcaster.  It should be well resourced and should have a well-regulated and modern regulatory framework.  In addition, the emphasis should be on excellence in production, scriptwriting and diversity.  Diversity is highly important because there is a great deal of competition from other channels and people enjoy wide choices.  If Irish national television is boring and lacks a variety of programmes, people simply will not tune into it and consequently will be exposed to other cultures, a different broadcasting ethos and so on.</P>
        <P>In addition, one consideration I am sure already has been mentioned pertains to the arrival of so many new Irish.  I am unsure whether this Bill addresses the issues of diversity and the provision of programming that would attract the interest of the large communities of people in Ireland from Poland, China or the African nations.  Perhaps this issue will be referred to subsequently.</P>
        <P>From the outset, RTE has made an immense contribution.  Although Ireland is a small country, RTE competes with and measures up to larger television networks throughout the world in respect of quality.  Ireland has produced some great producers and technical personnel such as camera people and so on, over the years.  As times are changing, Members must consider many new approaches to television and to getting across one&rsquo;s message to the nation.  Hopefully <Col N="280"/>this Bill will respond to those challenges.  As there have been lengthy debates on this Bill in the Seanad and in this House to date, I will pick a few sections on which I wish to comment.</P>
        <P>Section 42, for example, empowers the broadcasting authority to create additional broadcasting codes, including codes covering objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs, as well as encroachments on privacy.  This is a highly important section.  Members should cast their minds back to the 2002 election, to what was one of RTE&rsquo;s dark days.  It broadcast a television programme, &ldquo;No Tears&rdquo; just before the election, which featured as a central character the then leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Noonan.  It did a great deal of damage to Deputy Noonan and to Fine Gael in the subsequent election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>People on the other side of the House accepted and agreed that this was completely unfair.  Had a code been in operation at that time, I am certain the programme would not have been broadcast before the election.  While the programme doubtless was made with RTE&rsquo;s support, it was one of the first Irish political events to be dramatised since I entered this House.  It pertained to a highly sensitive subject about which the man in question, Deputy Noonan, had apologised to the McCole family several times, having made a comment in the D&aacute;il that really was directed against the barristers representing Mrs. McCole at that time.  However, Deputy Noonan accepted the comment should not have been made.  It was a dark day for RTE when it dramatised the event and broadcast it in a very unbalanced fashion before the election.  Hopefully this Bill will ensure that will never happen again to any party in this House.</P>
        <P>I will turn to section 42(4), which provides that the BAI will prepare and regularly update an advertising code pertaining to matters likely to be of direct or indirect interest to children, having particular regard to children&rsquo;s general public health interests.  This relates in particular to the question of obesity and advertising that might encourage youngsters to eat energy-dense foods that lead to obesity.  I wish to raise a few issues regarding this section.  I have been highlighting the issue of obesity in this House for years and did so at a time when the subject was rarely mentioned in the media.  As a former teacher I had noted the profile of youngsters growing heavier, which evidently was due to a lack of exercise and eating too much food.  However, I am unsure whether this provision will have the desired effect.  Much food that is advertised to young people is necessary.  Moreover, the industry should be aware that it can advertise healthy food to young people.  It should be acceptable for companies to advertise food with a high nutritional element, the use of fruit in the diet, for example, or what we consider to be essential healthy foods such as vegetables, milk, fish or chicken.  On the one hand we have the HSE and others promoting the food pyramid and on the other, even foods recommended in the pyramid will not be advertised.  I remember reading an article some time ago in the <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i> which indicated cheese got the red light in England because of the level of salt in it.  It was argued that cheese is bad for a person.  Parents in this country would not advise their children that cheese was bad for them and it is generally highly recommended in the diets of youngsters.</P>
        <P>According to criteria that may be set out in this, cheese could be a food whose advertising would be prohibited.  I urge much caution on this.  From speaking to people in the industry, there appears to have been very little consultation with the food industry in the development of this section of the Bill.  Its representatives feel there should certainly have been more consultation.  The food industry in Ireland is worth approximately &euro;20 billion and over 48,000 people are directly employed in the sector.  Although this provision will not affect all those people, it is of major importance.</P><Col N="281"/>
        <P>The industry should have at least been consulted on this provision but apparently it was not.  Will the Minister of State refer to this in his response?  I am sure his adviser will know if these people were consulted.  Some of the groups mentioned this in contact with me and I am sure we all got the same information.</P>
        <P>There is a point that if advertisers cannot advertise locally and nationally, they will do so through Sky and other media channels outside our jurisdiction and which we cannot control.  This section should be considered again and the people writing the code should be careful of the types of food they proscribe.  They should also be aware that advertisers will probably go elsewhere.</P>
        <P>The banning of advertising of certain food items while leaving the advertising of alcohol untouched has been mentioned by many other speakers.  As far as I am concerned, alcohol is far more damaging and threatening to the health of young people than certain foods.</P>
        <P>The issue of obesity takes in much more than just food, as young people should be encouraged to eat smaller portions.  There is also the issue of exercise and several agencies have been set up to consider inactivity and obesity across the country.  It is kind of a buzz word and the HSE is putting out regular bulletins on it.</P>
        <P>Young people are doing less exercise and, for example, they do not walk or cycle to school any more.  Young people rarely cycle to school because parents drop them off for various reasons.  The element of physical activity in their daily life is getting smaller.  At one time many youngsters in this country lived on farms in the country and their daily chores involved lifting water buckets, bringing in turf or going to the meadow or garden during the summer.  All of that has now been taken from people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P>Addressing the issue of obesity in this section by making a song and dance about it will not significantly reduce the levels of obesity.  Research by the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance indicates that the main drivers of obesity in children are consumption of inappropriate portion sizes &mdash; they are too big &mdash; and lack of physical activity.</P>
        <P>I did a survey across the country a few years ago which found that only 28% of primary and secondary schools from a sample of approximately 1,500 had indoor physical education facilities suitable for class.  In the bad weather we get most of the time, this means no physical education is possible in some schools.  As a result, if the young people are not elite athletes involved in the local club, they do no exercise.  I agree with the research carried out by the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance and wish to emphasise the point.</P>
        <P>In France there is a general ban on the televising of alcohol products, which is broadly seen as successful.  In Norway and Sweden, advertising to the public of all alcoholic beverages above a particular alcohol content is completely prohibited, with a similar ban in Italy.  There was a proposal to ban alcohol advertising by a previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, but this was subsequently abandoned because of the apparent pressure put on him from the alcohol industry.  Perhaps the Minister will look at the code and consider including alcohol.</P>
        <P>The advertising of alcohol products is quite effective &mdash; there is a current advertisement using the term &ldquo;c&aacute;ca milis&rdquo; &mdash; and it can connect with young people even more than food advertising.  From that point of view, drink is a bigger threat in many ways than food advertising.</P>
        <P>Another issue brought to my attention is the use of Irish bands, folk groups and performers on national television shows, radio stations and so on.  There are some very angry people out there in the folk and Irish country scene at this time.  I do not meet too many of them but I have met some.  People have contacted us on this issue, such as Danny McCarthy, whom the <Col N="282"/>Minister of State may know.  These people are very disappointed with the level of coverage they get from RTE which, for example, controls four radio stations and provides a wide spectrum of music cover.  These people feel they are not getting a look in, although they may use harder language.  They feel that they entertain people across the length and breadth of the country, providing entertainment for people in the 32 counties.  They play small and large venues and people listen to them.  They would not be on the road unless they attracted audiences and it paid them.  The national broadcaster will not play their music.  If people are out there listening to these performers and enjoying the music, surely they would enjoy the music on radio as well.  A music forum should be set up or perhaps there should be some provision in this Bill for some kind of a consultative group.  I do not know if such a provision exists in the Bill.  If a group was established it could listen to the concerns of these people, who are in ways the heartbeat of this country.  At times they represent a certain type of Irishness that still has a big audience.  These people are major contributors to the Irish economy, whereas much of the material played on RTE&rsquo;s 2FM, for example, could be from artists not from this country at all and who may make no contribution.  Will the Minister address some of these points?</P>
        <P>Speaking to some presenters on RTE about the Brendan Shines of this country, they might tell us they are old hat and people turn that music off.  The population, particularly the older population, does not switch it off.  This is the type of material older people like.  I hope this issue will be addressed as a result of the proposed extension of the public service remit of RTE and TG4 and the provision of proper resources.</P>
        <P>The funding available to Lyric FM was recently reduced and the station is strapped for cash.  This year marks the bicentenary of the birth of Michael William Balfe.  Unfortunately, Lyric FM&rsquo;s outside broadcasting unit is unable, for financial reasons, to record a number of major events which have been arranged to celebrate the occasion.  This will be a major loss in terms of making programmes which could be archived and stored for posterity.</P>
        <P>This year also marks the bicentenary of the publication of Moore&rsquo;s melodies.  Thomas Moore, through his poetry and ballads, probably did more for the Irish emigrant than any other Irish composer or writer of ballads.  Written in the early part of the 19th century, his songs were sung in America and elsewhere.  However, funding is not available to arrange an event in the National Concert Hall to mark the occasion.  In addition, those who are visiting various parts of the country to promote the bicentenary have not received funding.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision to increase funding for independent broadcasting, with &euro;40 million the minimum amount RTE must spend on independent production.  As someone who has benefited considerably under RTE&rsquo;s independent production unit, IPU, having been involved in the production of eight documentaries on Kerry writers and one documentary on Kerry football, I thank the IPU and specifically Claire Duignan for being so receptive, helpful and encouraging when approached with solid proposals.  Without support from the IPU, important documentaries would never have been made on Kerry football and writers such as George Fitzmaurice featuring people who knew him, including Bryan McMahon, John B. Keane, Tom McGreevy, Con Houlihan and one or two others.</P>

	<P>I make no apology for referring to north Kerry writers.  I am in favour of strengthening the budget available to RTE&rsquo;s independent production unit, for which I have great admiration.  The provision of funding to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland for similar productions has not worked out very well, whereas the IPU has done an excellent <Col N="283"/>job in that respect.  The increase in funding for the latter body will enable it to do more good work.</P>
        <P>I support the proposal for an Irish film channel, although I am not certain televising the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas would attract many viewers.  The business of the House is arranged in a manner that would not attract much interest.  It could be described as boring or seldom exciting.  In addition, Members let themselves down at times and would not like members of the public to see their behaviour.  Nevertheless, I would support the establishment of a new channel.  Deputy Coveney raised issues about its funding.</P>
        <P>There are so many stories to be told, particularly by a large number of elderly people who can go back to the 19th century through their parents and grandparents but will soon move on.  If their stories are not collected or recorded, they will be lost forever.  I hope the new channel will provide an opportunity to make many more programmes on important items and issues of local history because many such programmes cannot be made currently owing to a lack of capacity.</P>
        <P>I was involved with a several other people in trying to make a documentary about Annie Moore, the first woman to go through Ellis Island.  Incidentally, she was a native of County Cork rather than Kerry.  As part of a celebration of Annie Moore&rsquo;s life, a headstone will be erected on her grave in New York tomorrow.  I assisted a number of people who wished to make a documentary on the topic.  While we received a commitment for funding in New York, we were unable to secure funding in Ireland, including from RTE.  This is wrong as the programme would have been worth making.  Not only was Annie Moore the first girl to pass through Ellis Island, but the programme could also have focused on the many other people who passed through Ellis Island.</P>
        <P>I have raised a number of the deficiencies in the legislation.  With increased funding and in the event that a new television channel is established, we should be able to see more local history programmes.  I am pleased to have had this opportunity to raise a few issues which I hope the Minister will address.  The Bill can be amended and improved in all our interests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to comment on this welcome Bill.  Prior to the establishment of many local radio stations, RTE and its predecessor, Radio &Eacute;ireann, had sole responsibility for providing broadcasting services.  Both organisations operated on shoestring budgets as they set out to establish proper broadcasting services and deserve great credit for the service they provided.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I understood the Bill was intended to review the functions of RTE, establish a broadcasting authority of Ireland and give both bodies greater independence to develop and expand.  I was, therefore, disappointed to read in the legislation repeated references to the Minister and his role in controlling broadcasting.  Will the legislation result in further intrusion by the Minister on the new regulatory authority, for example, in the selection of its members?  The legislation requires that those appointed to the authority must have experience in areas such as media affairs, public service broadcasting, broadcast content production, digital media technologies, trade union affairs, business or commercial affairs and matters pertaining to the development of the Irish language.  If those appointed have expertise in all the areas cited in section 9, we will have an active, constructive authority.  I am concerned that the Government will appoint the nine members of the authority.  Nevertheless, I welcome the new role of the joint Oireachtas committee in this regard.  That change will provide an element of transparency in the appointment of members.  At least their characteristics and the background they may have in broadcasting will be scrutinised and their names laid before the House, which is welcome.  I am not sure if the Minister of the day will be magnanimous and will move away, once and for all, from the idea of politically motivated reasons for appoint<Col N="284"/>ments.  That has been the case with many boards in the past, although not necessarily with the board or authority with which we are dealing.  It is positive that we might hear of the demise of many boards and quangos next week and that those appointed to boards in any area of Government responsibility in the future will be selected on the basis of merit and expertise.  If the Minister does that, it will be a first, a welcome step forward.  I am not convinced, given the provisions of the Bill and the reference to the controls the Minister will have, that this will be done.</P>
     
        <P>In the recent past, at the start of the current financial crisis a fortnight ago, the Minister immediately contacted the director general of RTE and is supposed to have given him a dressing down, although that has been denied, about the contents of a radio programme that started what might have been a panic reaction among people to move their finances between, or withdraw them from, the banking institutions.  People do not change their ways that quickly.  I would welcome being proven wrong about this.</P>
        <P>The Bill introduces many new concepts.  It will grant a range of new functions to broadcasters and regulators and will set a framework for new activities and services, particularly in the light of technology, and at the same time it will liberalise and streamline the regulatory burden placed on broadcasters.  If that is to be the case, section 32 clearly indicates there will be an imposition and a burden on broadcasters in regard to the way they present their programmes and the balance and fairness in them.  Those two proposals are not reconcilable.</P>
        <P>Presenters of RTE radio programmes and television programmes in particular, who are household names, have dominated certain programmes over the years.  While they have been entertaining, no effort has been made by RTE to give the new talent of professionals in this field, whom we have in abundance, an opportunity to work in this sector.  They have had to leave to work in the media across the water or elsewhere.  These young professionals have not been given a chance to work in the broadcasting media here because of the dominance of presenters who have continued to work on shows, the ratings of which have declined over the years.  These presenters have been given selected high exposure time slots and demand not to be shifted out of those time slots which attract high audience participation, listeners and viewers.  Not only do they demand particular time slots during which they will be available to present, they receive unbelievably high remuneration.</P>
        <P>It is sad that RTE management does not provide more opportunities and exposure for our young talented people who are professionally trained in all aspects of the media.  Perhaps in the past programme presenters did not have the required training, expertise or professionalism, but they were balanced in their presentation and provided a good service, having regard to the requirements of the day, but this is 2008.  Some individuals have been successful having exercised great determination and grit to break the stranglehold many of the old hands had over certain areas.  I hope this Bill and the new authority will recognise this issue and give those young people an opportunity to work in broadcasting.</P>
        <P>RTE has been generous in its support of Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and TG4 down the years.  There is no doubt that the stations were a burden following their establishment, but they were supported by various Ministers, two of whom I single out for mention, the former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, representing a Gaeltacht area in Connemara, and the Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who identified the function of TG4 and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta in representing RTE&rsquo;s cultural obligation in recognising our language.  It has supported the Irish language and, as a result of the nature of the programming provided by Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and TG4, has put life back into it and people have recognised its importance as a language.  Were it not for RTE, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and their work, Gaeilge would not be recognised as an official European language.  It is important to recognise RTE&rsquo;s input and, given the <Col N="285"/>restricted finance available to it relative to the service it provides, it has stretched the contributions of TG4 and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, so to speak, in terms of continuing to provide programmes.</P>
        <P>On the question of income derived from advertising, the danger of allowing an over-dependence on some major advertisers to develop will be evident to many people who watch NBC, Fox News or other such channels, having regard to the restrictions on which they can insist in return for advertising revenue, the slant that can be put on even the news, the presentation, focus or highlighting of particular aspects of policy they may favour or, as is becoming prevalent now with the pending presidential election in the US, putting forward their political views.</P>
        <P>We have a restricted capacity for advertising in Ireland.  If the Government gave a commitment, once and for all, to respond to the difficulties in certain areas, particularly that of alcoholism, it would recognise that this legislation presents an opportunity not previously presented to ban or severely restrict alcohol advertising to very late hours during programming.<b>  </b>If we add up the cost of dealing with the downside of the abuse of alcohol, whether in the area of health, education or insurance, and divert some of the resources spent on advertising of alcohol to other areas, this legislation will have done a good job.  I hope the Minister will give serious examination to this issue and will ignore the powerful lobbies dedicated to the promotion and sale of alcohol.  I urge him to make a clear and sensible response in respect of the need that exists.</P>
        <P>When one compares the resources available to RTE 1, RTE 2, TV3, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta etc., to those that are available to BSkyB, one can see how difficult it is for Irish broadcasters to compete in order to win the right to cover major sporting events, both domestic and international.  BSkyB and other sports broadcasters are in a position to monopolise particular events.  RTE can rarely compete at that level.  However, it tries its best to do so within the limited resources available to it.  During the Olympic Games, it was unfortunate that we could not watch Irish athletes perform as a result of certain restrictions that were put in place.  That was terribly unfair to those who wanted to follow our the progress of those competing at the Olympics on behalf of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Many people cannot afford to pay the contributions required by BSkyB to watch football matches at weekends.  They are obliged to go to the local pub or hotel to watch and are presented with the opportunity to indulge in imbibing alcohol.  I accept that everyone might not partake of a drink, but the opportunity to do so exists.  People&rsquo;s need to go to pubs and hotels to watch sporting events dictates the content of advertising on television.  Many of these sports networks carry large amounts of alcohol-related advertising.</P>
        <P>The Bill places a burden on broadcasters to ensure that there is balance and impartiality in the context of advertising and in the way in which shows are presented.  Deputy Deenihan referred to an event that happened prior to the 2002 general election.  I agree with him but I will not repeat what he said.  I recall many other instances where it was not as glaring but where a similar political bias or slant occurred.  There are those who will observe: &ldquo;He would say that, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;  However, a certain party has dominated the Government for the past decade.</P>
        <P>If one considers a list of presenters of various programmes and compares it to a list of the names of candidates who put themselves forward for election, one will discover an extremely close connection.  I will say no more than that.  However, this matter must be examined.  I am delighted the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="286"/>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will clarify it for the Minister of State.  I am sure he is aware that I am hinting at something.  I do not want to be any more blatant than I have been so far but I will be if the Minister of State so desires.</P>
        <P>When one considers a list of candidates&rsquo; names and then examines the content, method of presentation and personalities &mdash; one might go so far as to discover who are their siblings or what are their party politics &mdash; involved in programmes on which they appeared, one will be able to identify connections to the major party in government.  One need not dig too deep in order to uncover that fact.  A bias has been displayed in the presentation of certain programmes, particularly in the lead up to elections.  I hope the Minister will impose in respect of broadcasters the necessary mechanisms to prevent such bias being displayed in the future.  I will say no more on the matter.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, the programme on which the proceedings of these Houses are shown, is one of the greatest examples of fair and balanced presentation and it allows the views of people across the wider political spectrum to be shown on national television.  The programme is a credit to those involved in its production.</P>
        <P>The Minister should consider certain aspects of the Bill, particularly those relating to advertising.  I welcome what he is doing in respect of the licence and the collection of the fee.  I hope we will avoid the disasters which occurred in the past.  There are many people who receive television signals but who do not pay for the privilege.  I hope the mechanism included in the Bill in this regard will bring an end to their behaviour, once and for all.</P>

Ar n&oacute;s an Teachta de B&uacute;rca, bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag pl&eacute; le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; raidi&oacute; agus ruda&iacute; eile.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill, which is extremely important for the country and its people.  The Bill is also important for the Legislature, which is being given the opportunity to put in place clearly defined rules and regulations that will define public service broadcasting and, it is hoped, broadcasting in general in Ireland for many years.</P>
        <P>Raidi&oacute; &Eacute;ireann commenced operations in the 1930s and RTE began broadcasting television pictures in the early 1960s.  The latter was a major breakthrough for the country, which was presented with an opportunity to expose all that is good and great about its people, traditions, culture and value system and its uniqueness as a nation.  If one were to carry out a critical analysis, however, one would discover that our traditional value system and the great culture of our nation have not always been exposed in the way that they should.</P>
        <P>I hope the new broadcasting authority of Ireland will interpret the provisions of the Bill in a way that reflects the views of those in this House who, in turn, reflect the views of the people they represent.  When the relevant structures and parameters are put in place, I hope a level playing field will be put in place in respect of all broadcasting systems, corporations and agencies that are indigenous to the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is critically important that we go forward given that we live in a global age of mass communication, of instant opportunity to change systems and channels, to exploit the mindset of our children, young people, students and others.  Through this Bill we have transferred to the <Col N="287"/>Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the editors, sub-editors, broadcasters and presenters the serious responsibility to ensure that we purvey and convey by way of broadcasting communication and technological devices only the best for our country and for future generations, and that reflects all that is good about our nation since its evolution over the ages, taking into account our heritage and the unique culture we are proud to espouse and that has had a major impact across the world.</P>
        <P>This is a small country with an open economy, an island on the western edge of Europe at the fringe of the Atlantic Ocean.  There are only 5 million people on the entire island of Ireland but across the world we have an Irish diaspora of 100 million who love Ireland, its traditions and its value systems and who are proud to carry the flag of Ireland in everything they do.  Wherever our emigrants find themselves, there is an Irish nucleus and it is critically important that it is reflected in our broadcasting system as part of the enhanced and enlarged Irish nation whose emigrants have brought us great credit internationally in industry, sport, judiciaries and parliaments in different parts of the world.  It is important, therefore, that we should have a broader vision of the responsibility broadcasting has in conveying to the masses across the world, in so far as it can be transferred with modern communications &mdash; there is no barrier now to communication from this Chamber or from any part of this country &mdash; the activities of our nation in all their diversity, its successes and challenges and the opportunities that present themselves that make us proud of our nation.  It is not just for the people on this island, but more particularly our brightest and best who had to leave to sustain themselves and make their homes on foreign shores.  They too should be able to have that broad vision and lateral communication that is so important for them.  We can use broadcasting on television and radio as a medium that gives them a home from home atmosphere wherever they find themselves and whatever challenges they meet.</P>
        <P>We need a new Bill.  We need to reflect on the changes that have taken place in society and in our country.  We need to take into account the diversity of our people, the multicultural society that now prevails, the dramatic increase in population.  Twenty years ago we had a productive sector of approximately three quarters of a million people and the rest of the nation were dependent on those people to create the wherewithal and the resources to run this nation.  That situation has been transformed as a result of economic success over the past 20 years.  Today 2 million people are gainfully employed on this island.  We hope that broadcasting and communication will continue to make an even greater contribution towards the sustainability to our country and pride in our nation, fulfilling patriotism in all its ramifications.</P>
        <P>People have a duty not just to themselves, their families, communities and traditions but above all to this nation and this country.  Broadcasting has a major role to play and it has not fully discharged that role.  There are many challenges ahead.  It is my hope that when this Bill comes before us and we tease it out during the five Stages of parliamentary debate, the Minister will be open to suggestions from all sides of the House so that we can pass a strong, well worded, textually correct, legally powerful instrument that will assist the broadcasting industry and assist us as legislators and citizens as we go forward together in the knowledge that we have the confidence as a nation to carry ourselves at the highest level of international opportunity and international challenge, and that we have the confidence as a people to face any challenges there may be, financial or otherwise, irrespective of whether they are on this island or elsewhere.  Together, with good leadership, consolidation, coherence, focus, and positive communication from all our broadcasting organs, we can build a nation not just for this generation but for many future generations, and discharge our responsibilities as Members of Parliament so as to leave a better country when we leave Parliament than we inherited when we entered.  That is the duty of every generation, not only in politics but in society.</P><Col N="288"/>
        <P>The broadcasting industry and the broadcasting organs have a serious responsibility to ensure they are inclusive, that they take into account diversity and different interests.  It must also take into account the common good and ensure balance in society and in communication and a reflection of our sporting, industrial, urban, rural and other traditions.  It must reflect the views and wishes of all our people, taking into account strong interests in particular sectors of society, particularly aspects of culture.  I do not believe that balance has been properly struck.  I hope this Bill will ensure balance in the future and that as we go foward together we will discharge our responsibilitties as legislators, taking into account the advice that is available, our experience and collective wisdom gained in this House from representing the people in our constituencies, constantly inspired to serve them with the knowledge that is transferred to us by those people, by our experience as individuals, family members and citizens, and by the experience we have gained as Members of this House, whether in Parliament on Oireachtas committees or in Ministries in which we have been privileged to serve over the years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>At a meeting in Washington on 24 September, the United States Deputy Secretary of State, John Negroponte, and I signed a memorandum of understanding establishing a new working holiday programme between our two countries.  The agreement represents a significant and positive development in our migration arrangements with the United States and will help foster the growth of new and lasting contacts between young people from both countries.  It represents an important investment in the long-term health of this vital bilateral relationship.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to report that the agreement has been warmly welcomed by community, sporting and business organisations in Ireland and the US, including the GAA, the Ireland-US <Col N="289"/>Council and representatives of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.</P>
        <P>The new agreement contains the following key elements: the United States Government will make available as many as 20,000 visas for Irish citizens each year, which will permit them to work and travel in the US for a period of 12 months; the Irish Government will reciprocate and allow up to 5,000 US citizens to work in Ireland for a period of 12 months; and both US and Irish citizens will be free to secure employment on arrival in each country.  It will not be necessary to arrange employment prior to departure.  In order to qualify for the programme, participants must hold an Irish or US passport, as the case may be, and should be in post-secondary education or have graduated within the preceding 12 months.  The agreement will come into effect on 1 November 2008 and we hope to see the first visas issued shortly thereafter.  Further details about the scheme and how to apply are available on the website of my Department at <i>www.dfa.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The new working holiday programme represents an important contribution towards securing greater migration opportunities between this country and the United States, an approach endorsed strongly by the D&aacute;il in an all-party resolution passed on 6 November 2007.  At the same time, the Government is also actively pursuing the two other elements of our three pronged approach to this area, namely, a solution for our undocumented citizens and new reciprocal arrangements to provide long-term visas for Irish people wishing to work in the United States and US citizens interested in working here.  Finding a solution for our undocumented citizens remains a key priority.  In my meetings in Washington last month with US political leaders, I stressed the importance which the Government continues to attach to this issue.  I also held a meeting with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, ILIR, in New York, at which I announced the allocation of an additional $50,000 to that organisation, bringing total Government funding for the ILIR to $235,000 since 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>This side of the House welcomes arrangements with any country for the exchange of citizens.  Can the Minister confirm whether applicants need a post-secondary qualification?  I may have misinterpreted his comments, so I would appreciate clarification.</P>
        <P>When does he anticipate the exchanges to commence and how can one apply for a visa?  Will advertisements be placed in newspapers?  Will the visas be valid on a 12 month basis from the date of application or will they all commence on a certain date?  Will individuals be able to renew their visas or reapply after an interim period?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated in my earlier reply, we expect the agreement to come into effect in November.  People will be able to seek details of the programme from my Department.  Initial applications may have to be sent through the US Embassy in Dublin.</P>
        <P>The definition of &ldquo;post-secondary student&rdquo; encompasses all those currently enrolled in a recognised third level degree programme.  Students at vocational colleges, including institutes of technology, will also be eligible to apply if they can demonstrate that their studies will ultimately lead to a degree from a full-time post-secondary academic institution.  In other words, the student must be able to demonstrate that his or her diploma is intended to lead towards enrolment in a degree programme.  That creates possibilities for HETAC and FETAC in terms of the national qualifications framework.</P>
        <P>In an exchange of correspondence between myself and the Deputy Secretary of State, the latter has indicated that the US State Department will apply flexibility to the administration of the scheme.  Those engaged in trade apprenticeships will have to demonstrate that their vocational studies could in time lead to the awarding of a degree in, for example, construction <Col N="290"/>studies.  Those who have graduated more than 12 months prior to their application will not be considered eligible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that the Minister ensures the details of this scheme are published as soon as possible.  I am concerned the programme may be somewhat exclusive in that someone who wants to take a year out after completing his or her leaving certificate will not be able to apply for a visa.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is regrettable because students often prefer to take a year out after secondary school to travel abroad.</P>
        <P>If US exchange students cannot find employment, will they be entitled to benefits in this State?  If they have prearranged employment but this ceases during the 12 month period, what will happen?</P>
        <P>Has any progress been made in regard to the undocumented Irish?  Do we know the number involved and is there hope for their families?  Deputy McGinley and others have raised this issue on many occasions.</P>

	<P>Ireland is the first country to achieve a working holiday agreement with the US.  I do not want to understate the significance of that.  Negotiations were held over several years and the scheme is not open ended in the sense that it is available only to those who are in post-secondary education or within 12 months of graduation from third level education.</P>
        <P>A similar agreement has been in place with Australia since 1985.  Approximately 17,000 Irish people went to Australia last year and 13,000 travelled the previous year.  The J1 working holiday scheme, which is valid for the summer months, was taken up by approximately 6,000 Irish citizens last year, whereas only 290 US citizens came to Ireland on the programme.</P>
        <P>In our view, this is just the first step of a wider approach.  Our intention is to develop strong bilateral frameworks with the United States, a country with which we have strong historical ties.  Having dealt with work permits in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I found it strange that we did not have reciprocal arrangements with the United States from a cultural, social or employment perspective.  Given that generations of Irish people have emigrated to America since before the Famine, some sort of bilateral framework should be put in place.</P>
        <P>We are pursuing the idea of a renewable work visa arrangement with the US.  To that end I met with senior Senators and Congressmen on my visit to increase the prospects of their arriving at such a conclusion.  However, that would not include the undocumented Irish, who represent the third prong of our approach.  This will await the outcome of the presidential election in the US.  We have continued to lobby in this regard.  I met with the Congressional Friends of <Col N="291"/>Ireland, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Pat Leahy, the Chairman of the relevant House sub-committee, Zoe Lofgren, and many others to try to get consensus on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>When the US-India civil nuclear co-operation deal was originally agreed in principle between President Bush and Prime Minister Singh in 2005, and during the lengthy and complex process which followed, Ireland was to the fore in raising concerns and asking questions in regard to its impact on the global disarmament and non-proliferation regime.  However, we noted that the deal would extend the scope of IAEA safeguards over Indian nuclear facilities, and also made clear that we understood the strong reasons which led the Indian Government to seek a secure and plentiful supply of energy to address poverty, promote development and combat climate change.  It was the consistent policy of the Government, reiterated several times in this House by my predecessor, not to make any final decision until all elements were on the table.  We also made clear that we would take into account the range of views among other Nuclear Suppliers Group, NSG, members, in particular those with a similar approach to disarmament and non-proliferation issues.</P>
        <P>After a lengthy delay due to domestic Indian political factors, the issue finally came to a head in the late summer, with meetings of the IAEA board of governors on 1 August and of the NSG on 21 to 22 August and 4 to 6 September.  At the NSG, Ireland, which played a leading role among a group of like-minded countries, was active from the outset in seeking clarifications and conveying concerns about the proposed exemption of India from the NSG&rsquo;s guidelines on civilian nuclear trade.  We put forward an extensive series of proposals aimed at improving the text and meeting our concerns.  During this period, we had extensive contacts inside and outside the NSG at both political and official level with the United States, India and numerous other states.  It became increasingly clear that a large majority of NSG member states, including several countries whose concerns are usually similar to those of Ireland, were in favour of granting the exemption.  I recall that the Nobel Prize-winning director general of the IAEA, Dr. ElBaradei, also strongly supported the deal.</P>
        <P>On 5 September, in response to demands within the NSG from Ireland and a few other states, India issued a significant statement reiterating its key positions on disarmament and non-proliferation.  These include a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing and strong safeguards against nuclear proliferation in third countries.  On this basis, and following a number of further changes to the text of the NSG decision, Ireland reluctantly joined the consensus in the NSG on 6 September.  Ireland and several other states made it clear that we expect India to honour all of its commitments, and that any breach of them would require the NSG to review its decision.  We will continue to work to strengthen the non-proliferation treaty in the lead-up to the next review conference in 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>If I might deconstruct that reply, I will put my questions simply.  Will the Minister give details of who precisely contacted the Irish Government, as is reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, and at what level, with the aim of taking away one of the building blocks of Irish foreign policy?  The Minister mentioned Dr. ElBaradei, but Dr. ElBaradei&rsquo;s predecessor Dr. Blix, in visiting the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, clearly stated that the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty was very important.  Those of <Col N="292"/>us who are interested in the international significance of this responded to his suggestion that a secretariat be appointed for the treaty.  On several occasions at Question Time I have asked the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors about the implications for Ireland&rsquo;s non-proliferation treaty of agreeing to the US-India nuclear agreement, and at every occasion the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors have said they have the gravest concerns.  What the Minister is really saying now is that because only two countries supported him in the late stages, possibly Austria and New Zealand, he decided it was best to roll over.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the difference between India and the five existing nuclear powers &mdash; those countries that regularly breach Article VI of the non-proliferation treaty?  The discipline they have with regard to the IAEA is exactly what is on offer from India.  A sixth nuclear power has been created and the non-proliferation treaty has been abandoned, or crucially weakened.  As well as that, the Minister must remember the review conferences in 1995 and 2000, when we joined with other countries to create the New Agenda Coalition.  The 2005 review conference was not a success, but we continued working on.  Now the Minister has thrown in the towel.  Could he give the reasons for this to the House?  What pressure was applied by Condoleezza Rice?  Did President Bush phone the Taoiseach?  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor will remember that the Indian Prime Minister sent a special delegate here to pressurise people into saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Finally, perhaps the Minister will give details of the multi-billion-dollar arms contract between the US and India which followed within days of the agreement.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As Dr. Blix said when interviewed in 2006, there are several aspects to the US-India deal.  There is the non-proliferation aspect, the environmental aspect, and the energy security aspect, the latter two of which the Deputy has completely ignored in his commentary.  These are legitimate issues that we can no longer ignore in the global climate in which we live.  He said the rule was adopted in the NSG in order to induce states such as Israel, India and Pakistan to give up their nuclear weapons status&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>And why did the Government not hold that line?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or deter others from seeking nuclear weapons.  In return, they would have access to the most advanced civilian technology.  He went on to say it has been clear for many years that neither India nor Pakistan, nor Israel would walk away from their nuclear status and that under these circumstances the NSG rule has become a punishment instead of an inducement.  The question, then, is whether anything can be gained by getting away from this rule in terms of keeping the lid on proliferation, and Dr. Blix&rsquo;s answer to this was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  This is the person the Deputy quoted.  He stated: &ldquo;It is true that India, with a billion people, can reduce the pressure for oil and gas consumption by expanding its nuclear industry&rdquo;. <Col N="293"/> That is good for India&rsquo;s energy security and good for the environment, as it will help stem global warming.  These are positive aspects of the deal.</P>
        <P>What did Ireland try to do, as one small country among many others?  The Deputy mentioned the New Agenda Coalition.  Where was the New Agenda Coalition?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not one small country.  We are coequal with 44 others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Where was the New Agenda Coalition, of which the Deputy spoke earlier?  I will tell the Deputy.  Of the seven members, only two &mdash; Ireland and New Zealand &mdash; worked hard to improve the deal.  Two &mdash; Brazil and South Africa &mdash; were strong supporters on the basis of their overall relationships with India; Sweden and Mexico were broadly neutral and made clear they would not block a deal; and Egypt is not a member of the NSG.  Prior to the deal, six Indian nuclear reactors were under the IAEA safeguards.  Under the deal an additional eight will be covered&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What about all the others?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;bringing the total to 14.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Out of 22.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and all future civilian reactors will also be covered.  We said reluctantly that these are demonstrable improvements in terms of bringing plants under civilian safeguards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>However, they breach the non-proliferation treaty.  The Deputy knows that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will call the Deputy briefly again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s disappointment that a consensus was arrived at, but we worked to achieve discernible improvements to the agreement.  The final text will help ensure that the non-proliferation treaty remains the cornerstone of disarmament and non-proliferation and that India is held to its commitments, with observation and monitoring on an ongoing basis.  The transfer of sensitive technologies will be ruled out entirely once negotiations are concluded on the provisions of paragraphs 6 and 7 of the NSG guidelines, including a provision that all states engaging in nuclear commerce with India must notify other NSG members of each and every transfer.  These are improvements we brought to the text.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone knows that under Article VI of the non-proliferation treaty, as the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors agreed, there was supposed to be nuclear disarmament.  Countries ignored that.  The Minister has now added a sixth country to the five who are free to abuse the treaty.  What credibility does he now have?  He is allowing, for example, eight nuclear installations in India not to be under anybody&rsquo;s control.  He tells the House that monitoring of 14 out of 22 installations is better than nothing.  His predecessor, Frank Aiken, would not be satisfied with something that is better than nothing.  What credibility does he have now when facing the Iranian question?  He will take up a strong position on a country that has not demonstrably breached any of its obligations with regard to international treaties.</P>
        <P>I am sorry the Minister does not like the phrase &ldquo;rolling over&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me quote Daryl G. Kimball, for example, who is one of the major opponents of this treaty.  He said: &ldquo;The Irish Government did all it could.  In my view <Col N="294"/>no other country played a more energetic role in identifying the problems with this deal.&rdquo;  That is not capitulation.  It may be fanciful for Deputy Higgins to engage in that kind of hyperbole and rhetoric.</P>

	<P>The number of staff employed by my Department on 1 October 2008 is 1,545.  This includes 320 permanent staff who are working in the Passport Office in Ireland and approximately 300 local staff currently employed at missions abroad.  The equivalent figure as of 1 January 2000 was 1,385.  The increase of 160 staff during the intervening period was focused on two main areas: the Passport Office and Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme, Irish Aid. </P>
        <P>In the case of the Passport Office, a total of 120 additional staff were recruited since 2006 in response to significant annual increases in the demand for passports over recent years and the introduction of the new e-passport, featuring a biometric chip.  This increase in the permanent staff enabled the Passport Office to maintain a high level of customer service while also significantly reducing the number of temporary clerical staff engaged in the lead up to and during the busy summer period, as well as its reliance on overtime during this peak season.</P>
        <P>The recruitment of additional staff for Irish Aid was directly related to the rapid expansion in the scale and scope of the development assistance programme which has seen the aid budget increase from &euro;255 million in 2000 to &euro;769 million in 2008.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that, since 2000, my Department has overseen the opening of 19 new missions overseas.  These included embassies in the capitals of nine member states who have joined the European Union since 2004 and four missions linked to the expansion of the aid programme.  The establishment of these new missions was achieved in large measure from within existing staffing resources.</P>

How many people are working for Irish Aid in Limerick?  How does this compare to the figures before it was decentralised?  I have also looked at the numbers of staff working in the Minister&rsquo;s office.  I know it is populist to attack Ministers for the staff numbers in their own <Col N="295"/>offices.

	<P>The question related to staffing generally.  The Department has shown a commendable efficiency in how it has expanded its work and in reducing overtime and temporary workers.  The vast majority of increased staff actually effected a significant reduction in temporary contracted staff in the Passport Office.  The number of passport applications has greatly increased owing to additional applications from Northern Ireland and for children etc.  The queries we get from all over the country that my private office needs to attend to on an ongoing basis are very fundamental ones relating to people who are abroad facing various challenges and difficulties.  We are often the first port of call to help our citizens overseas.  After approximately six months in the job, my observation is that the majority of calls relate to those kinds of inquiries.</P>

	<P>It is estimated that Ireland&rsquo;s spending on official development assistance, ODA, for 2008 will reach 0.54% of GNP.  The Government is committed to reaching the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2012.  We remain on course to meet that objective.  I am confident that this year Ireland will also maintain its position as the sixth most generous <i>per capita</i> donor in the world, which was confirmed by the OECD for 2007.</P>
        <P>During the 2008 Estimates process, the Government allocated &euro;914 million to ODA.  Some &euro;814 million was allocated to Vote 29 &mdash; international co-operation &mdash; of the Department of Foreign Affairs and an estimated &euro;100 million to other Departments and through Ireland&rsquo;s allocation to the EU development co-operation budget.  This allocation, based on the then estimated GNP, was made to achieve a target of 0.54% of GNP in 2008.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, in light of the changed economic situation, the Government reviewed current expenditure allocations across all Departments in July.  The overall ODA allocation for 2008 was revised to &euro;899 million, which continued to ensure that the ODA target as a percentage of GNP would be met.  Adjustments of &euro;45 million were identified which brought the revised allocation managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, through Irish Aid, to &euro;769 million.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s priorities remain as set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid.  Assistance to sub-Saharan Africa will continue to be the top priority, as will measures to counter climate change and rising food prices, investment in education, health, the fight against HIV-AIDS, <Col N="297"/>good governance and efforts to promote gender equality.  These are the issues that have the most impact on those least able to cope.</P>
        <P>The Government is now at an advanced stage in preparing the budget for 2009.

	<P>I am delighted to hear the Minister of State say we shall be on target for the 0.7% of GNP in 2012, if I heard him correctly.  Does he have any projected figures as to what the funding might be for 2009 and 2010?  I have seen figures in the past for those years based on certain growth rates.  I acknowledge that the economy has contracted and the figure will decrease.  However, he might be able to give the House some indication.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind that the economy will contract, where will the cutbacks fall as regards the granting of aid?  Will it affect the NGOs or the programme countries and how does he envisage doing that?  Also, I am sure the Minister of State will be very anxious to deal with some of the recommendations in the Hunger Task Force report.  Does he see movement towards aid for food production and the World Food Programme, in compliance with one of the report&rsquo;s recommendations?</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Deputy will find out almost exactly at the same time I do what the budget allocation will be for 2009.  As he well knows, nobody can predict what that will be until it is published by the Minister for Finance on that particular day.  It is, however, important to know that the overarching target of 0.7% is expressed as a percentage of GNP.  That obviously translates, on a year by year basis, into real terms and real money, but because it is expressed as a percentage of GNP the figure alters, accordingly.  The reality is that GNP, far from being a projected 3.5% for this year, will be somewhere in the region of -0.1% and the budget is altered, accordingly.  We have allocated the adjustments in 2008 equally right across the programme with the exception of missionaries and NGOs to whom we had made specific commitments at the start of the year.</P>

<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the recommendations of the audit report of the Committee of Public Accounts was that NGOs and missionaries needed to be given a formal role in the deployment of aid.  That would be a very good development.  Will the Minister of State say whether there have been proposals to do that?  Also, will he look at the concept of setting up an umbrella group whereby there may be some mechanism or filter body for streamlining small projects, say, where individuals are running modest projects on their own &mdash; where someone can make a small application for funding without thousands of people arriving at the Minister of State&rsquo;s door?<b></b> How are such projects being dealt with at present? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy mentioned the Hunger Task Force report.  That is the subject of a separate question and we shall delve into that shortly.  NGOs have an enormous role as regards delivery.  They deliver more than &euro;100 million of overseas development aid on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I understood their former role involved the programme countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>They are involved in all of our programme countries in their own right and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="298"/>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;they are very much engaged in delivering their own programmes.  As I said, they deliver an enormous percentage of the overall Irish Aid budget on the ground.  Indeed they are one of the key delivery mechanisms on behalf of the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>As regards small projects, a system is in place for micro-funding, up to a limit of &euro;20,000.  The application process is relatively simple.  They are considered every couple of months and decisions are made on them.  I do not see any deficiency in the system, as I understand it.  Certainly, for very small NGOs comprising one or two people, the system may be difficult and we can have a look at that.</P>

        <Quest> if Defence Force participation in peacekeeping in Chad will continue in the event that EU forces are replaced by a UN mission in March 2009; his views on the UN replacing the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Union operation in Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR Tchad/RCA, was established for a period of one year from March 2008.  It is playing a key role in ensuring the security of refugees and displaced persons living in camps along the eastern border of Chad, and in facilitating the provision of humanitarian relief, as well as in protecting the UN policing mission in the area.  I pay tribute to the success of EUFOR and to the professionalism of the members of the Irish Defence Forces participating in the mission.  In my recent meeting at the United Nations with Lynn Pascoe, the Under Secretary General for Political Affairs, he spoke very warmly of the positive contribution they are making.</P>
        <P>Despite the success of EUFOR, it is clear that an international presence will continue to be required in the region for some time.  In this context, I welcome the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1834 which expresses the intention of authorising a UN military mission to follow on from EUFOR after 15 March 2009, when its current mandate expires.</P>
        <P>It is expected the UN will, in due course, issue a formal request to Ireland to provide a contingent for this operation, and I would view such a request favourably in principle.  However, a decision to participate will need to await the outcome of ongoing discussions on the size, composition and mandate of the follow-on operation.  Account will also be taken of the intentions of other current EUFOR participants and the support they would provide.  It is worth noting in this regard that logistical support from non-EU partners, including Ukraine and Russia which are both providing helicopters, has been vital for EUFOR.  This underlines the issues the EU has regarding the military capabilities available to it for important missions of this kind.</P>
        <P>Irish participation in a UN follow-on operation will, of course, be subject to the triple lock of UN mandate and Government and D&aacute;il approval.  My colleague, the Minister for Defence, has indicated he would be positively disposed to participation by the Defence Forces in the follow-on mission subject to the above issues being addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  Will he clarify that the Security Council resolution has been formally adopted so that there is no likelihood of a security vacuum when the troops withdraw from Chad, which is enormously important?  I understand that Ban Ki-moon has expressed the intention to increase the personnel deployed when the EUFOR mission is taken over, essentially, by the UN, from the current figure of approximately 3,300 to <Col N="299"/>around 6,000 at that stage, at some point in 2009.  When will the Minister consider &mdash; I hope, favourably &mdash; the application of the UN for Irish troops to remain as part of its mission?  Does he envisage a scenario whereby there will be potential to increase the number of troops deployed from Ireland as part of that ongoing mission? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We abhor and are very determined to avoid a vacuum or any uncertainty arising.  We shall be pressing very hard for clear decisions, not just a resolution but actually a clear pathway for the UN force coming in on the button, so to  speak, so there is a seamless transition from EUFOR.  However, there are issues to be considered and obviously the Minister for Defence will take the lead in terms of requirements of our Army.  The Deputy has alluded to the size, composition, balance of forces, logistical support and so forth and these are questions we obviously want ironed out before finally agreeing to participate in the force.  However, we have put a good deal of investment into our existing presence there and our desire is to continue it.  Obviously, there are always issues in situations such as this that need to be teased out with the UN.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, our presence is quite substantial in Chad, with more than 450 troops.  It is the largest of any presence we have globally at present.  That in itself is significant and if we can maintain this level of operation we shall be doing very well because this is a very challenging mission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>Further to that, the Minister has mentioned some of the logistical issues and the support that has been forthcoming from Russia, Ukraine and so on, which is badly needed.  I echo and support his viewpoint as regards the need for greater capabilities within the European Union.  On a related issue, our troops will undoubtedly be there until March and possibly beyond that date.  I understand from media reports that one agency withdrew from that region in Chad just within the last few days.  Is the Minister aware of that?  Perhaps he will comment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The security situation in eastern Chad is relatively peaceful.  However, the rainy season will end in the coming weeks and that could bring about increased rebel activity, banditry and criminality, which has implications for safety and security and the overall secure environment EUFOR is seeking to develop.  Operational Commander Nash is confident EUFOR is in a position of strength to continue to ensure a safe and secure environment in which humanitarian actors can operate effectively.</P>
        <P>Two M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&eacute;res health facilities in Ad&eacute; and Goz Be&iuml;da in eastern Chad were robbed by armed personnel last weekend and, as a consequence, the NGO withdrew from the area.  The attacks involved roaming bandits and criminals rather than organised rebel activity.  EUFOR is clearly mandated to protect refugees and internally displaced persons to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and to protect UN personnel.  Activity by rebel forces as well as criminality and banditry are matters for the Chadian authorities as well as MINURCAT.</P>
        <P>We regret what happened but the Irish battalion did not receive a request from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&eacute;res for assistance over the past two months.  Irish personnel will continue their operations but will co-operate with and support the NGOs throughout the Defence Forces deployment with EUFOR.  Assistance has been provided to NGOs in the past, including the evacuation of NGO personnel to the Irish battalion&rsquo;s camp and so forth at Goz Be&iuml;da but many NGOs face ongoing challenges.  Our people intervene where they can on request but M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&eacute;res did not make such a request.  The organisation, however, is vulnerable to attack from criminal elements.</P>

        <QRef>[33994/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 30 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the full implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement, including the effective operation of all the Institutions &mdash; the Northern Ireland Executive, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British Irish Council.  The Taoiseach and I have conveyed that message to the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and all the parties in recent meetings and conversations, including during my visit to Stormont on 18 September.</P>
        <P>The Government is disappointed the Executive did not meet on Thursday, 2 October, and that this led to the postponement of the scheduled plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council the following day.  A number of challenging issues face the Northern Ireland Executive, including the central question of devolution of policing and justice powers.  It is the shared view of the Irish and British Governments that the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly should take on this responsibility, as set out in the St. Andrews Agreement, and I look forward to an early agreement between the parties on this question.  We believe it is time to complete the process of devolution.</P>
        <P>The Government remains in close contact with the British Government and the parties in the Northern Ireland Executive and will continue to offer support and assistance to the parties as they work to find solutions to their current difficulties.  I met Secretary of State, Shaun Woodward, yesterday evening to discuss the present situation, and our respective officials remain in close contact.  It is vital, particularly in these challenging economic times, that the Executive gets down to business and works in a spirit of partnership and co-operation for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland.  This will also facilitate the continuation of the work of the North-South Ministerial Council, which is in the interests of the island as a whole.  I am hopeful that, working together, the parties can resolve the outstanding issues before them, as indicated by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister during their joint appearance before a Stormont Assembly committee last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>We all share the Minister&rsquo;s aspiration that the work of the Executive resumes and that the outstanding issues are resolved.  Does he agree the failure of the Executive to meet over such a long period has the capacity to turn into a serious political problem?  Does he further agree the different constructions put on the St. Andrews meeting have contributed to the problem?  Will he indicate whether the Government, separately or <Col N="301"/>jointly with the British Government, proposes to take an initiative to facilitate moving past this impasse?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s proposition that this is a serious situation.  The Executive has not met for three months, which, ultimately, has implications for people&rsquo;s confidence in the devolution process.  Both Governments, therefore, are anxious that the Executive meets again and that devolution of policing and justice powers proceeds.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point regarding the St. Andrews Agreement.  People gained assurances from it but one can see that others did not sign up to the complete programme, including the justice dimension.  There is a certain degree of ambiguity there but, on the other hand, the stated position of all parties is they favour devolution of policing and justice functions.  The Democratic Unionist Party has stated it favours this.  This revolves around timeframe and confidence issues.  In other words, people are anxious that, prior to devolution of these functions, there should be confidence.  The British and Irish Governments are clear these functions should be devolved and they support that.  We would prefer if that happened sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>I met virtually all the parties on 18 September to assess their perspectives on this.  The position of both Governments is the parties within the Executive should first and foremost endeavour to resolve this issue.  Strand 1 is one of the three strands that affect our overall sets of relationships.  The parties should have the flexibility and the capacity to resolve this and other issues attached to it, which have caused friction and disagreement within the Executive, and it is important that they do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>The failure of the Executive to meet is giving room to splinter groups.  If it were meeting and conducting normal business, it would send a clear message that the system was working and it would lead to mutual trust, which could allow for the justice and policing issue to be settled.  This is a chicken and egg scenario and there is a significant need for the Minister, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister to act quickly to make sure the Executive works and, through it, to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.  Otherwise, young people will get involved in situations we will all rue in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is our desire that the Executive meets and both Governments have been in constant contact and have been in touch with the political parties, which are aware of our desire and our perspectives on this.  The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Brown have been in constant contact on this.  The Taoiseach has been involved with the parties and he has taken calls and had discussions with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.  We will continue to be of help and we are anxious to enable the parties to come to an agreement on this and other issues that have held up the Executive meeting.  I take on board the bona fide positions articulated by Opposition Members and I assure them we will do everything we can to enable the institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement to work effectively for the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister share my frustration about the recent lack of movement and progress on policing and justice matters?  People have been talking about this in recent weeks and they are frustrated by the lack of movement.  Will the Minister and the Taoiseach use their influence to bang heads together to move the parties forward?  I am concerned about complacency setting in.  People should not become complacent just because there is an absence of violent conflict.  Does the Minister agree that the majority on the island want the DUP to get on with the job instead of allowing dark forces to prevent progress?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="302"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all anxious that the Executive meet.  The House must acknowledge that all parties in Northern Ireland, including Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, have made tremendous strides to get to this point.  Many have moved on a range of issues.  We should never lose sight of the significant steps taken by all parties to having a devolved administration up and running on a power-sharing basis, with cross-community participation and so forth.  It is a unique form of government.  They have put so much work into this and shown great courage that it would be a tragedy to undermine it in any way.  People must continue to consider the big picture.  The problems are not insurmountable.  In principle, all parties are supportive of the policy dimensions of policing and justice.  It is a question of standing back, not getting hung up on specifics and saying they have moved a long way in ten years.  It should not be risked because a vacuum would not be desirable.  Others have reason to undermine the institutions and cause mischief and havoc, which must be avoided at all costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that, were the Irish Government to use part of its influence with the British Government to remove the stonewalling in some intelligence matters, including the previous activities of intelligence forces in Northern Ireland, it would contribute significantly?  Does he agree that co-operation by those on Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s side with the Garda and the PSNI in the Paul Quinn and Robert McCartney murder inquiries would have assisted?  The external moral suasion of both Governments would help in both respects.  The attitude of the British Government in refusing to reopen intelligence issues of the deepest concern on an all-island basis is not helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have pursued many of these issues with the British Government, including inquiries into particular cases.  On the broad political front, both Governments stand together regarding the impasse.  From the beginning, our strong relationship has been a fundamental pillar of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>Deputy Higgins referred to Sinn F&eacute;in.  While we would have preferred to see better co-operation on some matters, particularly those identified by the Deputy, Sinn F&eacute;in delivered on its commitments to the PSNI, namely, participation in policing boards and anything asked of the party.  To a certain extent, it moved its constituency with it in terms of the PSNI&rsquo;s acceptability and strength, which is important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It had the courage to leave the few behind also.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Since France took over the EU Presidency in July, I have accompanied the Taoiseach to two meetings with President Sarkozy and Foreign Minister Kouchner at which we had comprehensive and constructive discussions.  Consequently, we have gained a good understanding of each other&rsquo;s position on key EU issues, which will serve us well as we prepare for the October and December European Councils at which matters of considerable significance for Ireland and the Union will be discussed.</P><Col N="303"/>
        <P>On 21 July, the Government and the Presidency discussed the Lisbon treaty in Dublin during a visit by President Sarkozy.  On that occasion, the Taoiseach stressed the need for the decision of the people to be respected and explained the Government&rsquo;s objective of developing a fuller understanding of the concerns that influenced the outcome of the referendum before deciding on the best way forward.  The Taoiseach also stressed that the people remained committed to Ireland&rsquo;s full involvement in the European Union.</P>
        <P>During the meeting we exchanged views on the situation in Sudan and Chad and the important contribution being made by the EUFOR Chad-CAR mission to which Ireland and France are the two largest troop contributors and which is under the command of Lieutenant General Pat Nash.  There was also a discussion of the situation regarding Iran and its nuclear programme.  During his visit to Dublin President Sarkozy also discussed the outcome of the referendum with representatives of the political parties and others who had been active on either side of the referendum campaign.</P>
        <P>On 1 October I accompanied the Taoiseach to Paris for a further meeting with President Sarkozy and Foreign Minister Kouchner.  This meeting provided a useful opportunity for preparatory work ahead of next week&rsquo;s European Council.  It allowed the Taoiseach to bring the President up to date with the latest developments in Ireland, including the findings of the independent research commissioned by the Government and the establishment of the Oireachtas Sub-committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union.  At this meeting the Taoiseach also outlined the measures that the Government had announced to safeguard the Irish financial system.  The French Presidency has been giving priority to dealing with the financial crisis.  It is expected the Union&rsquo;s response to the crisis will be the central topic at next week&rsquo;s European Council meeting.  Ireland is open to a comprehensive European response and regards the European Council as an important opportunity for the Union to contribute to stabilising financial markets and managing the economic effects of the current upheavals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I might begin at the end.  Will the Minister address the apparent contradiction between the German and French positions on the future role of the European Central Bank in responding to rising unemployment in Europe?</P>
        <P>One reason for tabling the question is the original Lisbon accord&rsquo;s legacy of neglect of competitiveness and cohesion.  Given the long-standing French influence on competitive space, France&rsquo;s neglect of the cohesion aspect of the accord has emphasised the importance of mediating institutions.  Highly unaccountable institutions involved in speculative rather than productive versions of the economy were enabled to run riot with a type of wild capitalism, while the mediating institutions of state regulation or partnership were neglected.  When President Sarkozy stops lecturing us on where we should go, will the preparations for the forthcoming Council meeting include an employment strategy involving state initiatives?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the immediate aftermath of the June Council, there was an interesting discussion on social Europe.  The President of the Commission, Jos&eacute; Manuel Dur&atilde;o Barroso, was clear on the necessity for the European Union to demonstrate its relevance to its citizens in terms of expanded social programmes and so forth.  I am not sure that the Deputy&rsquo;s depiction of the Union and its institutions is entirely accurate.  There has been a strong social and cohesion dimension to the European agenda.  Take, for example, the new member states and the significant attempts to table proposals on workers&rsquo; rights, social solidarity and so forth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a neglected agenda.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="304"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Any country only holds the Presidency for six months.  Given that only three months of the French Presidency have passed, we cannot blame France for all of the European Union&rsquo;s identifiable shortcomings.  I am satisfied that the Commission is clear on the necessity to do more regarding the social agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Lisbon Agenda is important.  Obviously, the European Union has not gone far enough, predominantly because it has not been allowed to by member states.  We must consider this matter in the context of our position on the future of Europe.  Does the Minister agree that, were we not in the Union and the euro zone, the economy could have gone the way of Iceland&rsquo;s in recent days?  The safety net we have, by virtue of our membership, is absolutely crucial.  In bilateral discussions with the Presidency, has there been concentration on the future response?  There is a Council meeting next week but the EU cannot operate on the basis of a Council meeting every two months.  I assume there is more constant and regular communication.</P>
        <P>Regarding the fallout from Lisbon, in the Minister&rsquo;s discussions with the French President, is there frank discussion of the consequences of Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote to Europe?  The Taoiseach, the Minister and the Minister of State have stated that everything is rosy in the garden and that they were welcomed with open arms at Council meetings.  I do not believe this and we know that there are consequences.  I ask the Minister to outline these to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Creighton&rsquo;s point that we are a euro zone country.  The role of the ECB has been important in weathering the storm over the past 12 months in providing liquidity to our banking system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>It was crucial.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a story that needs to be told.  Every banking system has had major challenges, to understate it slightly, in the past few weeks.  Ireland would have had those challenges far earlier if it was not for the ECB.  Now is the time to be at the heart of Europe, not on the margins.  I would be worried about going down an isolationist road, which would not be good for the country and could imperil our future in terms of financial and economic stability and job creation.</P>
        <P>Regarding the EU Presidency, there were frank discussions but we are all democrats.  All democrats cannot get away from the reality when people vote.  People voted in a certain direction and that is it.  President Sarkozy understands that but is anxious to understand the underlying issues and to know if he can be of any help in respect of the issues the Irish people surfaced in the debate on the Lisbon treaty.  The national consultation we are engaged in through the Oireachtas committee is a good starting point.  The timeframe of two months is tight and I appreciate the co-operation of all in the Houses.</P>
        <P>In fairness to the French Presidency, it has been an eventful three or four months.  As President Sarkozy stated, he was hardly in office before he had the Lisbon treaty agenda on his desk because of the Irish vote, followed by a war in Georgia in August and the financial stability crisis in September.  It cannot be described as uneventful and he is wondering what is coming in the next three months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister respect the 53.4% &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum on the Lisbon treaty?  At times, the opposite message is coming across.  Does the Minister agree the treaty requires all EU member states to ratify it and that it cannot be implemented at the moment?  Does the Minister agree that the fear of conscription was never used in literature <Col N="305"/>brought out by mainstream &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners?  Does the Minister agree that this point, peddled in some quarters, is absurd?</P>
        <P>Is it not a bit rich that some European countries are lecturing Iran on nuclear powers when France and Britain are major nuclear powers?  I ask the Minister to bring this message to Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister under pressure from his colleagues in Europe to have a second referendum?  Have they articulated the view that they are under pressure to put him under pressure?</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to isolation and how we should not be going down the road on our own.  The perception was created that our European counterparts were not satisfied with the policy we adopted in the banking crisis.  Was that view articulated to him?  The British, French and Germans seemed to be dissatisfied with the route we took.  Did the Minister receive that message, notwithstanding that matters have changed dramatically in the past few days in those countries?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>This refers to Deputy Creighton&rsquo;s point that other countries in Europe have a desire to move forward.  We must reconcile the view in Ireland that we should be part of the EU with the dilemma faced by the EU from the decision not to proceed with the Lisbon treaty.  We must make up our mind what to do and that will happen in due course.  I prefer genuine engagement between parties in this House on that issue, in the context of the sub-committee, to see what the red line issues are for Ireland in terms of our continuing engagement with the EU.  Are there areas where we can get satisfactory assurances on certain issues?  It is a useful debate to have at this point.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Regarding the fear of conscription, independent research showed that 40% of the Irish people believed that the Lisbon treaty meant conscription to a European army, although I am not saying they all voted based on this basis.  I met one couple with two children at the polling station and they asked me if the children would be conscripted.  I am not making that up, it happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying it was included in literature on the treaty but the research showed that 40% of the Irish people believed that Lisbon meant conscription to a European army.</P>

	<P>We must go behind it and ask why people believe that.  What leads people to have that sense?</P>
        <P>Iran is not satisfying all of the transparency requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency and Dr. ElBaradei.  We have put this to the Iranians and there is ongoing engagement.</P>

	<P>The EU would love to have the Lisbon issue resolved and go ahead with it, but it cannot because of our decision.

Socialists and Christian Democrats wanted Ireland to get it sorted but that is their perspective and we have our perspective as a democratic country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 22, 50 and 60 together.</P>
        <P>The report of the Hunger Task Force, which was commissioned by the Government last year, was submitted on 25 September at the recent UN Millennium Summit in New York.  The Hunger Task Force was established before the current global food price crisis hit the headlines and was informed by our knowledge gained on the ground, through our overseas aid programme, Irish Aid.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I pay tribute to our former colleague Joe Walsh who did a magnificent job in chairing this group of national and international experts.  I thank each member of the task force for their <Col N="307"/>commitment and dedication in producing this report.  The report has been circulated to all members of the Oireachtas and copies placed in the Library.  The report is concise, focused and accessible, and provides a clear picture of what must be the greatest scandal of the world today, the fact that notwithstanding all the global technical development and innovation, in 2008 there are more than 862 million people who do not have enough to eat.  That number is constantly rising, driven by the recent escalation in the global price of food.</P>
        <P>The report of the task force is both timely and welcome and I have no difficulty in endorsing its overall findings that we focus our attention and efforts on three areas: to follow through on commitments made both nationally and internationally by all Governments, both donors and Governments of developing countries and to increase the priority given to hunger in the aid programme; to target smallholder agricultural productivity; and to promote effective actions to counter maternal and infant under-nutrition.  To follow through on this, I am establishing a new section which, <i>inter alia</i>, will have a special dedicated focus on food security tasked with advancing our work on addressing hunger.</P>
        <P>Hunger is a complex issue and the task force has made detailed recommendations.  Our first task will be to carry out a careful analysis of the recommendations and the extent to which current aid programming is responding to the many facets of hunger.  Once that exercise has been completed we will be in a position to plan how we can strengthen our efforts to address the root causes of hunger, with a view to making a real and lasting contribution to the abolition of hunger from our world.</P>
        <P>Two recommendations of the task force have been raised.  The first is that a target of 20% be set for aid spending on hunger by 2012.  In response to this, I assure Deputies that different aspects of food security are funded across a range of programmes within Irish Aid.  We must assess in full our current degree of engagement with hunger across the entire range of our programmes.  When the results of our assessment are available, we will be in a better position to determine how best to move forward with regard to volume and quality.</P>
        <P>The second is that a special envoy be appointed to ensure that the recommendations are implemented.  This recommendation will be examined closely and I agree that donors and governments should be held to account on their commitments.  However, we must reflect and assess whether the appointment of an envoy would be the most effective way to do this.  We must be sure that such a step will bring added value in these challenging times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this report.  I have a question for the Minister of State concerning the figure of 860 million people.  This was used at a conference in Rome in June 2008.  Can we establish how accurate this figure is?  It should be authenticated because it will be used again and again.  How are these measurements drawn up? </P>
        <P>I encourage the Minister of State to follow some of the recommendations, in particular that 20% of our overseas development aid should go towards alleviating hunger.  I stated earlier to some of my colleagues that education is important but there is little point in educating somebody who will die from hunger.  In the mid 1980s, 12.3% of overseas aid went to agriculture but in 2006 this figure was down to 3.1%, and the level of direct food aid given is back to where it was in the early 1960s.  It is very important that we push the concept of developing local agriculture.  We must re-emphasise this and must re-focus.  I ask the Minister of State if he agrees with me on this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy.  Regarding the 862 million, that figure came from international multilateral agencies such as the United Nations, the World Food Prog<Col N="308"/>ramme and from a collation of experts in the area.  It is their estimate that 862 million people will go hungry to bed tonight.  </P>
        <P>With reference to the figure of 20%, it should be noted that a considerable proportion of Irish aid spending goes across a range of programmes, including bilateral aid, multilateral aid and through the United Nations and international agencies.  It is difficult to calculate the precise proportion of the amount of aid spent on the alleviation of food hunger.  I fully agree with Deputy Timmons that this amount is much less than it was in the 1980s, not just in this country but across all donor countries.  If this report serves to do one thing it is to re-focus our attention and that of all donor countries to this fact.  Food and food hunger should be at the centre of our international aid and development programmes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State if Ireland Aid is interested in establishing a special study on the issue of land ownership, taking specific account of recipient countries of Irish aid in Africa.  This is in the context of investment of outside countries such as Saudi Arabia, China and others, and also the recycling of what might be regarded by many people as dubious oil revenues into the purchase of land.  Such purchase comes at the cost of the capacity of those who are occupying the land in order produce their own food, bring it to market and so on.  This is a question of respect for tribal and ethnic common ownership of land.  The other side of that is to address the issue of those in the slums who are without title to their shanty existence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is very well made.  Part of the problem regarding the declining capacity of many developing countries to produce their own food is the increasing fragmentation of small holdings.  That is a major problem.  Allied to that are problems with establishing proof of legal tenure, including that of women who comprise, surprisingly, 80% of all farmers in Africa.  This figure is borne out in the report.  Their rights to own land and to develop that land for productive agricultural purposes are diminishing because of fragmentation.  That is a very real issue which we must address.  It is an extremely complex issue and varies from country to country.  In Mozambique, for example, all the land is owned by the state.  In other countries nobody knows who owns the land and the system goes back perhaps to early stages of feudal ownership such as we had in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s point is well made.  The key, however, as identified and recommended in the report, is that international foreign aid and development should be focused upon increasing the productive capacity in agriculture.  We have lost focus on that, not only in Ireland but right across the world.  The report takes a leadership role in the international community.</P>
        <P>I conclude with one point.  The report on food hunger, which was welcomed across the House, shows Ireland taking an outstanding leadership role in the world.  This report was launched on the floor of the United Nations, in the presence of the UN Secretary General and to wide acclaim in the international community.  Ireland is at the cutting edge, taking a leadership role on this issue and Irish people should be proud of that.</P>

        <P><i>Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, this morning the House ordered the Whips to set aside time for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, to come into the House and make a personal statement.  The Whips duly met and agreed that a suitable time would be now, at this moment in proceedings.  The Minister conveyed to the Government and Opposition Whips that he would do so.  I understand now <Col N="309"/>that he is not coming to the House.  This is the kind of arrogance and disrespect for the House that I find intolerable.  I ask the good office of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to ensure that the House is not treated in this cavalier fashion by the Minister when an agreement was made with the House on all sides, including the Ceann Comhairle, that the Minister would be here to make a personal statement.  He has now said that he will not come because the matter was to be on the Adjournment.  The matter on the Adjournment is entirely separate.  The Minister agreed to make a personal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a long point of order.  A personal explanation is a matter exclusively for the Deputy concerned.  I have been informed that the Minister made no request to the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office for time in which to make a personal statement. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>To put the record straight, the Minister conveyed to the Office of the Chief Whip that he was prepared, and wanted to make a personal statement and that he wished to do so at this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I can only say that I have been informed that no request was made to the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office for the making of such a personal statement.  We will therefore proceed to the normal business of the House at this juncture, namely, the Adjournment Debate.  I understand that one of the debates concerns the matter that the Deputies raised.  Does Deputy Costello have a point of order? </P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>While I was hoping to have the opportunity to listen first to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, this is an important issue that must be dealt with.  I cannot see a relevant Minister on the other side of the House to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, is present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Very well.  The issue is that the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, has been obliged to suspend all its family planning services for the remainder of the year.  The Minister of State will be aware the Irish Family Planning Association provides a national service to medical card holders and the reason it has been obliged to suspend its service for the final quarter of the year is that the Department of Health and Children has failed to provide the necessary funding.  Moreover, that Department has failed to increase the level of funding for the past two years.</P>
        <P>No family planning services will be available as a result of the failure to provide an increase in funding.  Second, the number of medical cards has increased substantially.  An additional 78,000 medical cards, as well as a number of GP-only cards, have been granted to citizens in the past 12 months.  When the quantity of medical cards increases, the service providers should have ample funds to deal with the services required by such medical card holders.  However, exactly the same sum of money has been made available.  The annual allocation from the HSE to the IFPA is a meagre &euro;290,000, which has not increased for the past couple of years.  As the IFPA is a not-for-profit charity organisation, it has no means of fundraising and must bear any over-expenditure on its annual allocation itself.  At present, it is &euro;60,000 over budget and has no means of paying off that money.  It now faces a bleak winter of being obliged to turn away medical card holders.  It is a catch-22 situation.</P>
        <P>The IFPA provides its services to the most vulnerable people in Ireland, such as young people, particularly in respect of teenage pregnancies, the unemployed, people with a disability, minority groups, ethnic women, single parents and those on low incomes.  Such services are essential in reducing the numbers of unwanted and unplanned pregnancies and in providing women with family planning and primary health care.  The services are provided on a national <Col N="311"/>basis and their suspension will result in many women being unable to access family planning services for the next three months.</P>
        <P>Cost-effective analyses indicate that for every euro spent on providing family planning services, more than four euro is saved on maternity services.  The experience of the IFPA is typical of the dysfunctional manner in which the Government goes about its business.  It makes a Cabinet decision to increase the number of medical cards but expects the service providers to operate with the same budget and staff numbers.</P>
        <P>The budget will be announced next Tuesday and the budget increase must reflect the rising cost of providing comprehensive family planning services, the recent increase in the number of medical card holders and the increase in annual inflation rates.  Something must be done immediately to ensure the HSE will increase the IFPA&rsquo;s budget in order that the necessary services and care will be provided for women and young people with medical cards between now and the year&rsquo;s end.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the provision of family planning services.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act 1992 and the Health (Family Planning) Regulations 1992, the Health Service Executive is obliged to ensure that an equitable, accessible and comprehensive family planning service is provided nationally.  The legislation requires health boards, now the Health Service Executive, to make available comprehensive family planning services, either directly or by way of an arrangement with another body.  The Department of Health and Children issued guidelines to the health boards in 1995 on the provision of family planning services for all persons in their respective areas who needed such services.  These services are provided primarily through general practitioners, non-governmental organisations and, to some extent, maternity hospitals and units.</P>
        <P>The Irish Family Planning Association is one of a number of bodies offering a range of services designed to support reproductive choice.  The Health Service Executive grant aids the Irish Family Planning Association on an annual basis to supply a quantum of service for this funding.  The executive has indicated that arrangements are in place with the Irish Family Planning Association for the provision of family planning services to medical card holders at their centres in Cathal Brugha Street and Tallaght in Dublin as an alternative to the normal GP services.</P>
        <P>The level of funding is limited to an agreed allocation discussed at various local service level agreement meetings throughout the year.  The HSE has indicated that the IFPA was advised in July of this year that additional funding would not be made available to address expenditure overruns and that the association was requested to review the service to ensure that it remained within its available budget allocation.  However, it is understood from the HSE that the IFPA has exceeded its budget in recent years, despite clear agreements in place for funding.  Clearly, the HSE and those bodies funded by the HSE must operate within the resources made available to them in any given year.  The HSE remains available to work with the Irish Family Planning Association to prioritise service provision within the allocated budget agreed to operate the service.</P><Col N="312"/>
        <P Just="Left">Family planning services continue to be available free of charge to medical card and GP-only card holders through their GPs.  If a GP does not provide family planning services, he or she is obliged to refer a patient to a GP who will provide such services.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this highly important matter.  It was a sad day at Shannon Airport last Monday when the announcement filtered through to Aer Lingus staff there.  Nearly all the 300 Aer Lingus staff employed in Shannon are to be written off by a single stroke of a pen.  The jobs of all check-in staff, baggage handlers and cargo staff are to be outsourced to lower-paid workers.  The cabin crew base is to be abolished and American crews will be brought in to do the cabin crews&rsquo; jobs.  This is an appalling way for a company to treat staff that have given such dedicated service and have shown such great loyalty to the airline for many years.  Although many of the staff involved chose to stay with the airline to help it to return to profitability, this is the thanks they have received.  Many of them have huge mortgages, young families and little prospect of finding alternative employment in an aviation business which, like other sectors of the economy, is experiencing a serious decline.</P>
        <P>The Aer Lingus workers in Shannon are the sacrificial lambs who are bearing the brunt of the Government&rsquo;s failure to act last year to secure the Shannon to Heathrow service.  Shannon bore the brunt of the crisis arising from the attacks in New York on 11 September 2001.  Every time Aer Lingus gets flu, unfortunately Shannon appears to get pneumonia.  Last year, Aer Lingus walked away from the profitable Shannon to Heathrow route that carried 360,000 people and opened a new base in Belfast.  According to my verifiable analysis of its load factors, Belfast&rsquo;s average load factor was only 45% for the first five months of this year, compared to the average load factor of 70% out of Shannon.  We were told this was being done for sound commercial reasons.  Although we now know differently, no one is to be held to account.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Were these proposals to be implemented, it would be the beginning of the end of the green uniform in Shannon.  I have travelled with Aer Lingus many times and have enjoyed its hospitality and friendliness.  As for the check-in, boarding, baggage handling, ramp, maintenance and cargo staff, as well as the cabin crew, the green uniform and the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte is what they are all about and is what they know best.  They are great ambassadors for Irish tourism and many American tourists choose to fly with Aer Lingus to experience the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte and a real sense of Irishness.  I fear that wiping out one of its greatest assets, namely, its staff, will do irreversible damage to the airline&rsquo;s brand name.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Aer Lingus, with the support of the Government, has for several years operated a policy of consolidating its business outside of Shannon Airport.  Following the Irish Ferries debacle, the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act was passed in the Oireachtas. Is this any different from what happened at Irish Ferries?</P>
        
      
        <P>Another part of the Aer Lingus proposal is to reduce the number of long-haul aircraft from nine to eight.  The objective of Aer Lingus is to walk away completely from Shannon Airport.  It might commit to service the airport next summer but beyond that I have significant doubts about its plans.  There are 65 US companies based in the region, employing 11,000 people, which are dependent on direct daily US services.  If we are to sustain these companies and maintain some level of competitiveness in the region, it is essential we have direct daily services.</P><Col N="313"/>
        <P Just="Left">Last year the Government let us down again on Shannon Airport.  It gave its blessing to Aer Lingus in seeking to axe the Shannon-Heathrow route and ignored pleas to intervene from all sectors of business, the tourism industry and trade unions in the region.  These sectors are still reeling from that decision and only this week Woodstock Hotel, a landmark in Ennis, closed with the loss of 40 jobs as a result of the loss of Heathrow Airport connectivity.  I see the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is present with the Minister of State.  They came into the House last year and voted in favour of this decision.  Will the Government turn its back on Aer Lingus workers at Shannon Airport for the second time in a year?  I appeal to the Minister to intervene.  The Government holds a 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus.  All avenues must be explored to resolve the crisis.  While the Government continues to claim Aer Lingus is a private commercial company, it has Government appointed directors sitting on the board.  Did they support this decision?  Does the Government support the decision to replace existing staff with other workers, either lower paid or from some other country?</P>
        <P>Will the Government impress on Aer Lingus management the importance of sitting down with its staff to find alternatives to these draconian measures?  Aer Lingus and Shannon Airport have a proud tradition and a wonderful history in aviation.  Little did we think as we approached the 30th anniversary of the departure of Pope John Paul II to the United States from Shannon Airport in September 1979 on the Aer Lingus flagship, <i>St. Patrick</i>, that this was the final chapter in the airline&rsquo;s close association with the airport.  I appeal to the Minister to intervene and ensure the proud association of Aer Lingus and Shannon Airport continues and that Aer Lingus workers at the airport will continue to fly the green flag.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  He will be aware that the commercial decisions of Aer Lingus are a matter for the board and management of the company and that it is not open to the Government to intervene.  Aer Lingus is an independent company and must make decisions on a commercial basis.  It is understood the cost savings are necessary in order that the airline can remain competitive.  These measures, we understand, will strengthen the long-term viability of transatlantic services at Shannon Airport.</P>
        <P>The Government regrets the announcement by Aer Lingus of its intention to outsource part of its operations outside Ireland, with a view to reducing costs and maintaining its ability to compete in what we all accept is a very challenging aviation market.  Any potential loss of jobs is regrettable, all the more so in the current international economic climate.</P>
        <P>It is very much in Ireland&rsquo;s interest that Aer Lingus maintains its role as a major provider of air services to and from Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is keenly aware of the human considerations at issue.  The industrial relations machinery of the State is available to provide any necessary assistance in resolving challenges faced by management and employees of the company.  It is encouraging to note that SIPTU has agreed to enter into a process with the Labour Relations Commission and, in the light of the wider global economic circumstances, the Minister urges all sides to take a sensible approach in dealing with the cost saving proposals.</P>
        <P>The State has given a mandate to its three representatives on the board relating to wider government, aviation or regional development policies but this mandate is subject to the overriding obligations of directors pursuant to company law to uphold their fiduciary duties and protect the interests of all shareholders.  From an Irish economy perspective, the overarching priority for aviation is that Ireland maintains the highest possible level of connectivity between Ireland and key business and tourism markets.  This is all the more important in times of global economic turbulence.  The problems facing the international aviation industry are well known <Col N="314"/>and we have seen recent business failures of established airlines such as XL and Zoom, while some well known flag carrier European airlines are experiencing severe difficulty.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware that the Shannon Airport Authority has been having discussions with Aer Lingus to identify costs savings with a view to bolstering the prospects of future development of its transatlantic services.  However, in framing any proposals to support Aer Lingus transatlantic services, the airport authority must ensure such assistance is provided on a commercial basis and also made available to other airlines.</P>

	<P>The sinking of the <i>Asgard II</i> on 11 September was greeted with much sadness and shock.  The <i>Asgard II</i> had served the country well since its commissioning in 1981, having been designed specifically for training purposes.  The training vessel carried thousands of trainees and docked in hundreds of ports.  It was a great ambassador for the country.  It was fortunate nobody was injured when the ship sank and thanks to the speedy action taken by Captain Newport and his crew, everybody returned safely.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has been said the <i>Asgard II</i> will hardly be salvageable, although I understand a survey is being carried out on the ship which is 70 m under water.  It has been indicated that it will take approximately &euro;5.6 million to build a replacement.  Now that there are major cutbacks and a reduction in tax receipts, there is surely a case to be made that the Government can make a saving.</P>
        <P>The <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> was built at a cost of approximately &euro;16 million and was the subject of much criticism at the time.  It is now available to the Government and everybody concerned with it is more than willing to allow it to be used by the State.</P>
        <P>I will give a brief overview of what has happened with the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> since its commissioning.  From 2003 to 2005 it carried over 300 sail trainees and 1,400 passengers.  In 2006 Rivercruise Ireland took over operation of the ship and from 2006 to 2008 it carried approximately 980 sail trainees and over 2,500 passengers.</P>
        <P>The <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>&rsquo;s first voyages in 2002 were from Cork to Fenit to Dublin.  In January 2003 it sailed from Dublin to Belfast to Waterford and back to Fenit for its maiden transatlantic voyage to West Palm Beach, Florida and up along the east coast of the United States and Canada before returning to Fenit.  Since 2006 it has visited the Belgian port of Ostend, the French ports of Brest and Cherbourg and the Spanish ports of La Coruna and Porto de Ferrol.  She has also visited the UK ports of Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool and Milford Haven.</P>
        <P>The operation of the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> has been self-funded since 2004 and over 200,000 people have visited during its port visits since 2002.  It is primarily promoted as a sail training vessel and available for private sailing charters and functions.  As I indicated, the vessel has proved to be very successful.  It is regularly invited to maritime festivals all over Europe.  In 2005 the Parade of Sail out of Waterford was led by three Irish ships, the <i>Asgard II</i>, the <i>Dunbrody</i> and the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>, as part of the Tall Ships festival.  The <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> continued with the fleet to join the Tall Ships festival in Cherbourg.  In 2007 it was involved in the re-enactment of the pilgrimage from Ireland to Santiago de Compostela and the flight of the earls voyage from Rathmullan to Quilleboeff.  In 2008 it was involved in the opening of the Southampton boat show and the principal attraction at the Cork Week international sailing competition at Crosshaven.  Its crew was twice asked to re-enact the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, from Waterford and Dublin.</P>
        <P>This is an opportunity for the State to save money.  The ship is available and I have outlined its track record, which is impeccable.  It has proved to be a very robust vessel on the high seas <Col N="315"/>and has crossed the north Atlantic.  It has withstood all the tests expected of it to prove it is a very good training vessel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>As the House will be aware, on 11 September the national sail training vessel, <i>Asgard II</i>, sank in the Bay of Biscay off the coast of France.  The ship was on a cruise from Falmouth in the United Kingdom to La Rochelle and on board were five crew and 20 trainees, all of whom were evacuated successfully and are safe and well.  The decision to abandon the vessel and take to the life rafts was made by the captain because the vessel was taking in water at a far greater rate than the pumps could handle.  Weather conditions at the time were moderate and all trainees and crew were rescued by the French lifeboat service and taken to the island of Belle He.</P>
        <P>I compliment the captain and crew of <i>Asgard II</i> on the professional manner in which all the trainees were quickly and safely taken off the vessel.  I also pay tribute to the French lifeboat service for quickly coming to the location and bringing everybody safely ashore.  Following a meeting of the board of Coiste an Asgard and subsequent consultations with insurance company representatives, it was decided to undertake an initial survey of the vessel to establish her status prior to any decisions being made on salvage.</P>
        <P>The vessel was recently located on the seabed in 80 m of water, close to where she sank.  The initial underwater inspection has been carried out using a remotely operated vehicle.  This indicates that the vessel is upright and largely intact.  Damage to one of the hull planks has been observed but it is not possible, at this stage, to determine whether this has resulted from impact with the seabed or was the original cause of the sinking.  Until further detailed investigations are carried out, it is not possible to state whether <i>Asgard II</i> can be salvaged.</P>
        <P>The board of Coiste an Asgard is considering the question of procuring a suitable temporary replacement vessel for <i>Asgard II</i>.  In that regard a number of factors must be taken into account, including the suitability of the vessel for sail training, number and qualifications of crew required and operation and maintenance costs.  The availability of funding will also be a key factor.  At this stage the Minister for Defence is not in a position to indicate when a decision may be made as to whether to procure a temporary replacement vessel.  If it is decided to procure a temporary replacement vessel, all options will be considered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  I ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to explain the circumstances in which he appointed to the Private Residential Tenancies Board two members of local authorities who are ineligible to serve on the board.  As a result of these appointments, more than 100 decisions taken by the board have been set aside.  Furthermore, this debate offers the Minister an opportunity to outline the steps being taken to have the board&rsquo;s decisions reconsidered and indicate whether he intends to review procedures for making appointments to State boards.</P>
        <P>A question must be asked about the legality of the Minister&rsquo;s appointments.  Under the relevant legislation, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, a person who is a member of a local authority &ldquo;shall be disqualified&rdquo; from becoming a member of the board.  In light of the unambiguous nature of this statement, has the Minister acted inappropriately and performed his duties in an illegal manner by appointing the two persons in question?  A second legal issue arises regarding the matter of redress in the 100 decisions taken by the board since the appointments were made.  Has a precedent been set which will expose the Private Residential Tenancies Board to legal liability?</P><Col N="316"/>
        <P>The Minister must answer a further series of questions.  Upon whose recommendations were the two individuals in question appointed?  For how long had they served before the matter came to the attention of the board?  When did it come to the Minister&rsquo;s attention that two appointments had been made illegally?  What specific action did he take on receiving this information?  What expenses were the two appointees paid for their participation in meetings of the Private Residential Tenancies Board?</P>
        <P>It appears from an examination of the appointments process that little consideration was given to the procedures and protocols clearly laid down in the Act, whereas every consideration was given to political cronyism.  The Minister&rsquo;s actions are a reflection of a &ldquo;one for us and one for them&rdquo; approach.  Is this the lesson the Green Party wishes members of the public to learn from its experience in government?</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s illegal appointment of two councillors, one member of Fianna F&aacute;il and one member of the Green Party, to the Private Residential Tenancies Board did not appear to be a source of embarrassment to him when he sauntered into the House this morning before attempting to saunter out again.  His lack of embarrassment is typified in his refusal to come to the House earlier to make a statement on the issue and allow Deputies to have a proper debate.  Instead, he will read a few lines and walk out the door at the close of business.  This is not the way the House should operate.</P>
        <P>The Minister was afforded an opportunity to have this issue aired prior to the Adjournment debate, which would allow Deputies to discuss the issue in an informed fashion.  Instead, he has chosen to read out the document he is holding to his chest before running out the door.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s appetite for appointing advisers is well established.  We know, for example, that he has a team of six people in his constituency office, four special advisers in his departmental office and three staff in his press office.  The total annual cost of these staff to the taxpayer is &euro;800,000.  One may have expected someone with such substantial resources at his disposal to have taken time to read the relevant legislation before appointing a member of his party to a State board.  The wording of the Act is unambiguous and leaves no room for interpretation.</P>
        <P>The immediate fall-out from the Minister&rsquo;s cock-up has been that more than 100 enforcements and rulings have been set aside, resulting in landlords and tenants being left in limbo.  No one is certain what is the current position and the long-term fall-out from this development can only be determined when we know the circumstances in which the two individuals in question were appointed and how the matter came to the board&rsquo;s attention.  Judging from the legislation, however, the appointments were illegal.  What legal liabilities does the board now face?</P>
        <P>This cock-up opens up the possibility that the propriety of other appointments made by the Minister since taking office may also be questioned.  A full audit should be carried out of all such appointments and a report placed before the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Residential Tenancies Act of 2004 instituted a comprehensive reform of the private rental sector.  It set out a modern legislative code which strengthens tenants&rsquo; rights and supports a more professional approach by landlords.  One of the central ingredients of the Act was the establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, which has a central role in the registration of tenancies and with the resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords.</P>
        <P>Appointments to the board are made by me, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Act specifies that the maximum number of board members shall be <Col N="317"/>15 and the minimum number shall be nine and, in making those appointments, a mix of legal, professional, operational and other skills is sought.  Given the quasi-judicial nature of the board and its regular interactions with the courts, legal representation on the board has always been very useful.  When considering further appointments to the board some months ago, I was particularly mindful that the existing board was strongly of the view that a barrister member would be helpful.  Accordingly, on 30 June last, I appointed Vincent P. Martin, a barrister-at-law and member of Monaghan County Council to the board.  I also appointed Dessie Larkin, a member of Donegal County Council with extensive experience.  Both appointments were for the period up to 31 December 2012.</P>
        <P>Last month, it was brought to my Department&rsquo;s attention that these appointments were made in error as section 169 of the Act not alone precludes members of the Oireachtas from membership of the board, but also members of local authorities.  This provision was overlooked in my Department when the appointments were being made.  The result is that both appointments were <i>ultra vires, </i>or invalid, and my office made contact in mid-September with both the individuals in question to advise them of this.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch will have no difficulty in principle with the fact that the people I chose to appoint to this board were councillors.  Only yesterday his Labour Party colleague, Senator Michael McCarthy, called on the Government to allow councillors to continue membership of harbour boards.</P>

	<P>Neither of the two appointees participated in any tribunals of the board, that is, three person appeal hearings.  They had, however, attended five board meetings between 4 July and September.  While all decisions at the relevant meetings were taken by consensus and with an attendance well in excess of the quorum of five, the board took legal advice on the matter and, in the interests of legal certainty, it agreed that all cases considered at meetings attended by the two gentlemen in question should be considered afresh.</P>
        <P>This was done on 19 September when approximately 120 cases brought to the board between 4 July and 9 September were considered anew.  Fresh determination orders and decisions were made and communicated thereafter to the parties.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to emphasise that no decisions were &ldquo;set aside&rdquo;, as stated in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times.</i>  Every case in question was reviewed by the board, which then issued legally correct determination orders and decisions.</P>
        <P>It also needs to be stressed that it is PRTB policy to pursue a criminal prosecution when requested in all cases of non-compliance with its orders.  In the case of an over-holding tenant, the PRTB will always<b> </b>initially take a civil prosecution, as this would then allow the landlord to recover possession of the property.  From time to time, certain issues arise in a case, making it economically unviable to pursue a prosecution.  This might be where insufficient information is <Col N="318"/>available as to the whereabouts of the non-compliant party and significant costs would be incurred in establishing this, and where there is little or no chance of recovery of these costs or the financial amounts awarded in the determination order.  I stress that the board&rsquo;s policy is to pursue enforcement of its orders, while being mindful of the need to ensure value for money for taxpayers.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that the PRTB has made significant progress since its establishment and it is heartening that less than 1% of tenancies end in a dispute.  While critical cases such as those involving illegal eviction or serious anti-social behaviour are fast-tracked by the board and handled within weeks, the board is acutely aware that the average length of time to deal with cases needs to be significantly reduced.  It has taken decisive steps in this regard, including proposals for amendment to the Act, several in-house operational initiatives and the design of an ICT strategy to optimise the resources available to it.  I advise the Deputy that, as Minister, I have secured an increase in the permanent staff cohort from 26 to 40&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>President Zardari faces significant political and security challenges. In addition, Pakistan is experiencing severe problems with the economy and serious, endemic, governance issues.</P>
        <P>As regards Afghanistan, the new President has got off to a promising start. I very much welcome the invitation he extended to President Karzai of Afghanistan to attend his swearing-in ceremony in Islamabad on 9 September. I welcome also the recent meeting between the Foreign Ministers of Pakistan and Afghanistan, at which ways and means of strengthening bilateral relations were discussed and at which the two Ministers reiterated their resolve jointly to fight extremist elements along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.</P>
        <P>Strengthening relations with India is another priority for President Zardari. Under President Musharraf, there had already been some positive developments in India-Pakistan relations, and the new President has demonstrated a renewed willingness to build up trust and to improve common understanding with India. A meeting between President Zardari and Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, took place recently in New York. The leaders pledged to resolve all outstanding issues between the two countries, including the dispute over Kashmir, and to bring lasting peace to the region.</P>
        <P>Further afield, Pakistan&rsquo;s relationship with the US is of crucial strategic importance to both countries. President Zardari has already made very clear commitments to fighting terrorism and militancy forcefully and effectively.</P>
        <P>Where Europe is concerned, Pakistan has also placed a renewed emphasis on the importance of strengthening EU-Pakistan relations. A number of high-level EU-Pakistan meetings will <Col N="320"/>take place shortly which will provide an opportunity for further discussions on the development of this relationship.</P>
        <P>Regarding the departure of President Musharraf, I respect the outcome of the internal democratic process in Pakistan. President Musharraf&rsquo;s legacy is a somewhat mixed one, but he must be credited with agreeing to hold democratic elections in January and to return the country to civilian rule. It is encouraging that his departure and the transfer of power to President Zardari&rsquo;s new administration was smooth, peaceful and in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Messages of congratulation have been sent to President Zardari. I also availed of the opportunity to meet the Pakistani Foreign Minister, Mr Shah Mahood Qureshi, in New York on 26 September. In addition to discussing regional and international issues, we agreed that we should work to develop a framework of bilateral cooperation, so that relations with Ireland can be expanded, in areas including private sector investment, educational exchange and trade.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 45, 51, 53 and 71 together.</P>
        <P>The EU has played a very positive role in promoting conflict resolution in Georgia, working closely with all sides while maintaining a cohesive position on issues of substance relating to the conflict. Lessons from the EU&rsquo;s involvement in Georgia can certainly be drawn on for the future. The outstanding role played by the Presidency, the common approach adopted by Member States, and the rapid deployment of the EU Monitoring Mission have demonstrated our ability to move quickly and decisively when there is agreement on an objective.</P>
        <P>Following the outbreak of the conflict on 7-8 August, when Georgia sent troops into the separatist region of South Ossetia and the Russian Federation responded with overwhelming force, the EU Presidency moved quickly to get all sides to agree to a 6 point cease fire plan on 12 August. The Presidency held an extraordinary European Council on the conflict on 1 September. This endorsed the Presidency&rsquo;s actions, agreed to suspend talks on a new EU-Russia agreement until Russian forces withdrew to their pre-conflict positions, and confirmed <Col N="321"/>the EU&rsquo;s opposition to Russia&rsquo;s recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Ireland and the EU have consistently supported Georgia&rsquo;s territorial integrity and sovereignty. We believe that comparisons between the situations in Georgia and in Kosovo are invalid.</P>
        <P>On 8 September President Sarkozy secured commitments from Russian President Medvedev on a complete withdrawal of Russian forces outside South Ossetia and Abkhazia within 10 days of an EU Monitoring Mission being deployed in Georgia. The agreement also indicated that international talks on the status of the two separatist regions would commence on 15 October. Following a decision at the 15 September General Affairs and External Relations Council, the EU Monitoring Mission has commenced duties in Georgia as of 1st October. Ireland has contributed four experienced monitors to the mission.</P>
        <P>On 22 September I had the opportunity to discuss the situation in Georgia at some length with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov when he visited Dublin. He confirmed Russia&rsquo;s positive impression of the EU&rsquo;s involvement in defusing the crisis and its intention to abide by the agreements it had made with President Sarkozy. Over the past weekend, Russia began dismantling its positions adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The tragic death of eight Russian servicemen and three civilians last Friday in South Ossetia has fortunately not slowed this process. Javier Solana confirmed yesterday his satisfaction with the progress towards final withdrawal of Russian forces from the areas around South Ossetia and Abkhazia. As agreed, this will be followed by the opening of a talks process in Geneva on 15 October under the auspices of the EU, UN and OSCE.</P>
        <P>The situation in Georgia has stabilised but remains very tense. There was considerable loss of life and damage to infrastructure during and after the fighting in August. While conditions have improved, 50,000 internally displaced people will require temporary accommodation over the winter and there will be difficulties with the return of approximately 20,000 ethnic Georgians to South Ossetia. Russia is providing assistance to the displaced in its territory and in South Ossetia. Little is needed in Abkhazia. International humanitarian organisations have been working with the Georgian authorities to provide assistance. FM Lavrov told me that the main need now in South Ossetia is reconstruction of damaged properties.</P>
        <P>The European Commission and World Bank are organising an international donors&rsquo; conference for Georgia on 22 October in Brussels. Ireland has provided over &euro;260,000 in humanitarian assistance since the onset of the conflict, focusing on meeting the most urgent needs. Longer-term assistance is currently under consideration.</P>

	<P>NEPAD, the New Partnership for Africa&rsquo;s Development, is an African-owned and led initiative which is intended to eradicate poverty, achieve sustainable development in Africa, enhance Africa&rsquo;s potential in the global economy and accelerate the empowerment of women. It is based on the recognition that the primary responsibility for Africa&rsquo;s future lies not in the hands of donors or multilateral institutions but in the actions of Africa&rsquo;s governments and peoples. NEPAD has been adopted by the African Union as its socio-economic programme and has also been endorsed by the UN General Assembly which has urged international support for its implementation.The priorities of NEPAD are: (a)  The establishment of conditions for sustainable development by ensuring peace and security, and good political, economic and corporate governance; (b)  The promotion of regional cooperation and integration; (c)  Capacity building; <Col N="322"/>(d)  The promotion of policy reforms and increased investment; (e)  The mobilization of resources both domestically and from international sources.</P>
        <P>The major progress achieved to date through NEPAD has been the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) which scrutinizes, monitors and reports on progress in good governance (both political and economic) through a forum of Heads of State of participating countries. Twenty-nine countries, including Irish Aid&rsquo;s seven programme countries in Africa, and South Africa itself have so far signed up to the APRM. Seven reviews have been completed to date &mdash; in Rwanda, Ghana, Kenya, Algeria, Benin, South Africa and Uganda. Two more reviews &mdash; in Burkina Faso and Nigeria, are due to be completed by the end of 2008. A number of others are also underway.</P>
        <P>Progress has however been slower than expected. One reason is the lack of capacity to manage the process at national and continental level. While the reviews have highlighted some of the key governance problems in the countries surveyed, implementing the recommendations has proven challenging.</P>
        <P>However, it should be acknowledged that this is a politically sensitive process and the full impact of the APRM on governance standards in Africa will not become apparent for several years. In spite of the challenges it faces, the APRM arguably remains one of the most important initiatives to date aimed at the improvement of governance in Africa. The commitment of African leaders to the process, the necessary capacity to manage it, and the continued implementation and guaranteed integrity of the APRM will be key to its success.</P>

	<P>The case to which the Deputy refers relates to five Cuban men, known as the Miami Five, who were convicted in the US in 2001 on charges ranging from espionage to first degree murder. On 4 June 2008, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Georgia, issued its judgement on appeals lodged on behalf of the five.</P>
        <P>The Circuit Court concluded that the appellants&rsquo; arguments, which centred on the suppression of evidence, sovereign immunity, discovery, jury selection, and the trial itself, were meritless and that there was sufficient evidence to support each conviction. The sentences of two of the defendants were affirmed, while the remaining three men have been sent for re-sentencing.</P>
        <P>It is my understanding that the defendants&rsquo; legal counsel is considering other avenues for appeal, including recourse to the US Supreme Court. As I have previously stated, the Government has no standing in this matter, which is a bilateral consular question between the US and the Cuban authorities and, consequently, I have not raised this matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 28 together.</P>
        <P>On 20 September, the African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee &ldquo;recalled&rdquo; President Thabo Mbeki as President of South Africa, as a result of comments made by a judge in relation to the prosecution of former Deputy President Jacob Zuma. President Mbeki immediately handed his resignation to the Speaker of Parliament, to take effect once his successor was elected. ANC Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe was elected President of South Africa in a parliamentary vote on 25 September. This change of President took place in accordance with the South African constitution.</P>
        <P>In his address to the nation following his election, President Kgalema Motlanthe paid tribute to the durability of South Africa&rsquo;s constitutional order and the vibrancy of its democracy. He committed the new executive to continuity in economic policy. The key priorities of his government will be to reduce unemployment, improve healthcare and tackle crime and poverty.</P>
        <P>The EU issued a statement on 29 September expressing its warmest wishes for the success of President Motlanthe&rsquo;s work, and paying tribute to the achievements of former President Mbeki. On behalf of the people of Ireland, President McAleese has written to congratulate President Motlanthe on his new position. The Government welcomes the fact that the change of Government in South Africa happened very smoothly, and we look forward to continuing our good working relationship with South Africa under this new administration.</P>
        <P>Both Ireland and the EU have continued their routine diplomatic contacts with South Africa throughout the changeover period, as is usual when an orderly change of Government takes place. The next meeting of the EU Co-operation Council with South Africa will take place in Cape Town 20-21 October, and this will be the next opportunity for political dialogue between the EU and South Africa. Finally, I should like to make the point that South Africa continues to be a source of stability in the southern African region, and an important partner for both Ireland and the EU.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 17, 57 and 160 together.</P><Col N="324"/>
        <P>Ireland, together with its EU partners, is committed to a negotiated and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East, with a two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at its core.</P>
        <P>Ireland strongly supports the Annapolis process, launched under US auspices in November 2007, aimed at reaching agreement between Israel and the Palestinians by the end of this year. While few now expect that this deadline will be met, it is understood that some progress has been made in the discussions, which have been led by out-going Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas.</P>
        <P>President Abbas briefed me during his recent visit to Dublin, explaining that while considerable work remained to be done, greater clarity and understanding has been achieved between the parties.</P>
        <P>Following its most recent meeting in New York on 26 September, the Quartet commended the parties for their serious and continuous efforts to reach agreement, and expressed its desire to see the process continue. I hope that such progress as has been made can be built upon when new administrations are in place in Israel and the US, and that the process will lead to a lasting and just settlement.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged by comments made by Prime Minister Olmert in an interview with an Israeli newspaper on 29 September. He acknowledged that, in order to make peace with the Palestinians, Israel would have to withdraw from &ldquo;almost all the territories&rdquo; seized during the Six-Day War in 1967, and clarified that his comments also applied to Jerusalem, &ldquo;with specials solutions&rdquo; for sacred and historical sites. He also made clear that any part of the pre-1967 Palestinian territory which was not returned would have to be compensated by the granting of a similar percentage of Israeli territory.</P>
        <P>The question of borders is one of the key &lsquo;final status&rsquo; issues for negotiation between the two sides. I firmly hope that Prime Minister Olmert&rsquo;s successor will continue to adopt a realistic approach.</P>
        <P>Similarly, it is clear that there will be no overall settlement without agreement on the question of refugees. While it is, of course, primarily a question for resolution between the parties &mdash; and I don&rsquo;t believe that it would be helpful to the process for others to seek to impose conditions on one side or the other &mdash; Ireland and its EU partners will do all within our means to support any just, viable and agreed solution.</P>
        <P>More generally, I welcome the improved security situation in the West Bank, and hope that it will result in the urgent lifting of restrictions on access and movement for ordinary Palestinians, facilitating greater economic activity and growth.</P>
        <P>However, despite the ceasefire that has been in place between Israel and Hamas since June, the situation in Gaza remains critical. I have consistently called for an end to the isolation of the people of Gaza, in particular through the re-opening of crossing points for people and goods.</P>
        <P>The continued construction of Israeli settlements also remains of serious concern. In my recent speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, I urged Israel to listen to the concerned voice of the international community on this question. An end to settlement construction would be a strong and welcome signal of good faith.</P>
        <P>Finally, I support and commend efforts being made by Egypt, on behalf of the Arab League, to advance reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas. Success in these discussions is greatly in the interests of the Palestinian people, and can only help to underpin efforts to secure a lasting peace.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 36 together.</P>
        <P>The Government has taken a number of steps to address the outcome of the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. At the European Council in June the Taoiseach gave his colleagues his initial assessment and explained that we needed time to analyse the result and to reflect on its full implications. Only then could we turn to devising solutions acceptable to Ireland and the other Member States.</P>
        <P>The European Council in June agreed that more time was needed to analyse the situation and that it would discuss the Treaty again at its meeting on 15 October in order to consider the way forward. The Taoiseach and I have made clear at all stages that our ratification procedure and our vote would have to be respected, just as we respected the procedures and decisions of others.</P>
        <P>Following the European Council, the Government commissioned comprehensive research, which aimed to identify our people&rsquo;s key concerns. The survey was conducted by experts in the research and analysis field. The results, which were published on 10 September, form an important input into our ongoing work in determining the best way forward for Ireland. The results also highlight the scale of the challenge facing us, especially in communicating more effectively about the Union&rsquo;s policies and purpose.</P>
        <P>At the European Council next week, the Taoiseach will provide a thorough analysis of developments since June. The Government will not, of course, be in a position to set out a basis for a solution, as our domestic process of reflection and debate has not yet been completed.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will brief his colleagues on the results of the research and on the establishment of the Oireachtas sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s future in the European Union.</P>
        <P>The sub-Committee is an inclusive political process designed to examine the options and challenges facing us in Europe. It will be expected to report by the end of November. The Government believes the sub-Committee&rsquo;s terms of reference are appropriately forward looking.</P>
        <P>This is not a time for re-running the referendum campaign. The priority for us at this stage must be to chart a way forward for Ireland in Europe. This will involve reconciling the concerns of the Irish people with the wishes of our partners, twenty of whom have now fully ratified the Treaty while a further four have completed their parliamentary procedures. By the end of the year, it is quite possible that all 26 of our partners will have ratified.</P>
        <P>This situation imposes a responsibility on us to strive with our partners for a solution that will enable all 27 Member States to move forward together. It has always been our firm wish to be part of the European mainstream. In the months ahead, we will be engaged in a determined effort to find a solution that respects the wishes of the Irish people and protects and develops our position within the Union.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 58 and 155 together.</P>
        <P>Since the referendum in June I have discussed the outcome and its implications with my counterparts in the Council of Ministers, and with leaders of the European Parliament and the European Commission.</P>
        <P>The June European Council agreed that more time was needed to analyse the situation and that the Irish Government would consult at home as well as with our EU partners, in order to suggest a common way forward. That is exactly what the Government has been doing since June.</P>
        <P>Last Wednesday, for example, I accompanied the Taoiseach to Paris to again meet with President Sarkozy and Foreign Minister Kouchner, in their capacity as President of the European Council. We had fruitful discussions with them in preparation for next week&rsquo;s European Council.</P>
        <P>I have also had the opportunity to discuss the situation with many of my colleagues and I will be meeting more of them over the coming weeks. The Minister of State with special responsibility for European Affairs has also been actively engaging with colleagues and this will continue in the period ahead.</P>
        <P>In discussions with colleagues, I have been highlighting the concerns which the Irish electorate raised during the referendum campaign. I have stressed that we wish to see these concerns addressed in a manner which accommodates both Ireland&rsquo;s interests and those of the other 26 Member States.</P>
        <P>On Monday, I addressed a meeting of the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the European Parliament and met with President Barroso and Vice-President Wallstrom. One issue that arose during these discussions was the challenge facing the Union in the field of communications. This came out strongly from the recent research into the reasons behind the referendum result. Leaving aside the Lisbon Treaty, there is a real need for the Union to communicate more effectively. The Commission has a key role to play in that regard and we look forward to cooperating with them in making the activities of the Union, and their everyday relevance, better known to our people.</P>
        <P>In all of our contacts in Brussels and elsewhere, we have underlined the Government&rsquo;s determination to maintain Ireland&rsquo;s position at the heart of an effective and responsive EU. All indications are that the Irish people want this positive approach to the EU to continue.</P><Col N="327"/>
        <P>We have made it plain that we are determined to find a solution within a reasonable timeframe. I recognise that the desire for a stronger, more cohesive and more effective Union has gained momentum in light of recent political and economic developments.</P>
        <P>At next week&rsquo;s European Council, the Taoiseach plans to provide a thorough analysis of developments since June. The Government will not, of course, be in a position to set out a basis for a solution, as our domestic process of reflection and debate has not yet been completed. He will brief his colleagues on the results of the research and on the establishment of the Oireachtas sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s future in the European Union.</P>
        <P>I hope that we will be able by the December European Council to identify more precisely the issues that need to be addressed and to outline the necessary steps to achieve our objective. It is not possible at this point to set a precise timetable for potential developments in 2009 although we fully recognise the desire of our EU partners for clarity at an early stage in relation to the basis on which the European elections will be held and the arrangements for appointing the members of the next European Commission.</P>

        <P FLI="0">New CSPs are planned for Uganda and Timor Leste. The current strategy for Uganda runs until the end of 2009. The process of preparing a new CSP will get underway in early 2009, following an evaluation of the current programme. Irish Aid is preparing a one year extension to the Timor Leste CSP (2006-2008) to ensure continued support to that country, while awaiting completion of its new National Development Plan. Malawi this year became the ninth Programme Country for Ireland and an interim budget of &euro;10 million has been put in place for 2008. It is intended to conclude a multi-annual CSP for Malawi by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>In the case of Zambia and Vietnam, a four year CSP covers the period 2007 to 2010 in each case with a funding commitment of &euro;123 million and &euro;87 million respectively for that period.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government continues to attach a high priority to supporting Irish communities overseas. This commitment is reflected in the unprecedented level of funding secured for emigrant services in recent years.</P>
        <P>The needs of the Irish community in Britain, in particular older people and those at risk of social exclusion, are a key priority. Since the publication of the Report of the Task Force on Policy regarding Emigrants in 2002, Irish community organisations in Britain have been allocated more than &euro;44 million in Government funding. In 2007 alone, Emigrant Support grants totalling &euro;11.484 million were allocated to more than 134 frontline welfare and community organisations in Britain. In 2008, grants exceeding &euro;8.5 million have already been allocated to 131 organisations, with further grant applications currently under consideration.</P>
        <P>The London Irish Centre, Camden is one of the largest and oldest Irish Centres in Britain. The Centre provides a range of welfare services to the city&rsquo;s Irish community and is host to the offices of several important Irish organisations, including the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas, the Irish Elders Advice Network and the London Irish Survivors Outreach Workers.</P>
        <P>In 2007, the Centre was awarded funding of &pound;582,974 (&euro;856,526), with further funding of &pound;437,755 (&euro;554,857) allocated this year. These allocations, like all emigrant services funding in Britain, were approved on the basis of recommendations from the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (D&iacute;on) and the Embassy of Ireland, London, in close consultation with the Irish Abroad Unit.</P>
        <P>Government funding enables the Centre to provide important frontline services to the local Irish community. These services include helping people to access housing and welfare entitlements and supporting those experiencing serious problems, such as alcoholism, mental illness and domestic violence. Government funding is also directed to the Centre&rsquo;s Outreach Programme, which helps to tackle social isolation and provides on-going support and referral services to the elderly in Camden and its surrounding Boroughs.</P>
        <P>In line with our financial requirements, the London Irish Centre has provided its independently audited accounts for the year ending 31 March 2007, and is expected to submit accounts for the year ending 31 March 2008 shortly. The annual accounts of all Government funded organisations in Britain are monitored and reviewed by the Embassy, London, as a matter of standard practice.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, matters arising from the past are being addressed through a variety of mechanisms, including the Weston Park Inquiries, the ongoing work of the Historical Enquiries Team, the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and the work of the Victims Commission.</P><Col N="329"/>
        <P>Since its establishment by the Chief Constable in 2005, my Department has maintained contact with the Historical Enquiries Team. My officials also liaise with families and NGOs with which the HET are interacting, and have taken forward their concerns in contacts with the British side.</P>
        <P>The wider question of the effectiveness and coherence of approaches to dealing with the past is among the issues being considered by the Consultative Group on the Past, which is co-chaired by Archbishop Robin Eames and Denis Bradley. The Government welcomed the establishment of the Consultative Group and has remained in close contact with it.</P>
        <P>I hope that various mechanisms for dealing with the past can help bring closure to victims and survivors, and hopefully underpin community confidence in the wider process.</P>

	<P>The eradication of extreme poverty and hunger is the central objective of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme.  The programme has a very high international reputation based on its poverty focus and commitment to excellence.</P>
        <P>The UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty is an opportunity for all of us to reflect on the scale of the challenge.  It is appropriate that it falls so soon after the high level event on the Millennium Development Goals at the UN Headquarters in New York in September, in which the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I participated.  I believe that our involvement demonstrated the determination of the Government to continue to play an important role in global efforts to combat poverty.  The UN event was also the occasion of the launch of the report of the Hunger Task Force, established by the Government to examine how Ireland can make a key contribution to tackling the hunger crisis in the developing world.</P>
        <P>On 17 October, the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will address the Biennial Conference of the Irish Forum for Global Health at University College Cork.  The Conference will examine global health challenges, focusing on the environment, hunger and diseases of poverty. The Irish Forum for Global Health is supported by Irish Aid.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 39 and 73 together.</P>
        <P>The situation in Iran, in particular in relation to the nuclear question and to human rights, remains of serious concern.  On the nuclear question, Ireland fully supports the twin track approach of the EU3+3 (involving France, Germany, the United Kingdom, together with the US, Russia and China), which offers Iran positive engagement and cooperation if it changes course, but a concurrent enforcement track at the Security Council while it refuses to do so.</P>
        <P>On 14 June, on behalf of the EU3+3, High Representative Solana handed an improved &lsquo;incentives package&rsquo; to the Iranian authorities, proposing areas of possible cooperation if Iran abandons its programme of uranium enrichment. Iran tacitly rejected this package by responding with a counter-proposal which did not provide for the suspension of enrichment.</P>
        <P>On 12 September, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei, briefed the IAEA Board of Governors on developments since his last report in May.  While his report noted some progress, it concluded that &ldquo;contrary to the decisions of the Security Council, Iran has not suspended its enrichment related activities&rdquo;.  The DG urged Iran &ldquo;to implement all measures required to build confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear On 12 September, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei, briefed the IAEA Board of Governors on developments since his last report in May.  While his report noted some progress, it concluded that &ldquo;contrary to the decisions of the Security Council, Iran has not suspended its enrichment related activities&rdquo;.  The DG urged Iran &ldquo;to implement all measures required to build confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme at the earliest possible date&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Responding to this report, on 27 September, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1835 (2008), reaffirming its previous Resolutions, and calling on Iran &ldquo;to comply fully and without delay with its obligations&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I met with Iranian Foreign Mottaki in New York on 29 September, and made clear to him our serious and ongoing concern regarding Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme, our strong support for the EU3+3 process, and the urgent need for Iran to listen to the voice of the international community and to comply fully with the IAEA&rsquo;s requirements.  I also raised our serious concerns regarding the worsening human rights situation in Iran.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the Iranian regime has become increasingly resistant to receiving representations from abroad, ceasing even to operate a formal human rights dialogue with the EU.  Among the many areas of ongoing concern are the suppression of dissenting voices in the media and suppression of NGOs, trades unions, women&rsquo;s groups and human rights defenders; torture and killings in custody; increased use of the death penalty, including executions of minors; a lack of freedom of religion, including the oppression of members of the Baha&rsquo;i faith.</P>
        <P>On the cases raised by Deputy Hogan, I am pleased that two of individuals in question &mdash; Mr Mahmoud Mohammed Matin-Azed and Mr Arash Ahmad-Ali Basirat &mdash; were released from custody last month.  The third, Mr Ramtin Soodmand, remains in custody.  These cases highlight the very real dangers facing Christians in Iran, including those who have converted from Islam.</P>
        <P>The Government has been monitoring the proposed apostasy law closely through our Embassy in Tehran, in cooperation with our EU partners.  As the situation currently stands, a draft of the law has yet to be finally adopted by the Parliament and a number of amendments are being proposed and debated.  The EU has expressed its acute concern about the law, which clearly violates Iran&rsquo;s commitments under the International Covenant on Civil and Political <Col N="331"/>Rights, to which it is a party.  I will continue to raise our concerns about human rights in Iran, including freedom of religion, at every available opportunity.</P>

	<P>Visits to Ireland by children from the Chernobyl region have, for over 17 years, offered the children the chance for rest and recuperation with Irish families.  The continued success of these visits is due to the efforts of the many charities and families who respond generously to the children year after year.  In recognition of the valuable work of Chernobyl Children&rsquo;s Project International, Irish Aid committed &euro;600,000 over three years in March 2008 for the development of day-care centres in Belarus.</P>
        <P>In our contacts with the Belorussian authorities they have frequently underlined their satisfaction with the welcome afforded the children in Ireland.  However, Belarus has proposed to a number of EU Member States, including Ireland, formal agreements that would, in their view, secure the welfare of the children and ensure their return to Belarus.  Pending conclusion of such agreements, the Belorussian Government indicated in late August that it would be suspending visits by Chernobyl children.</P>
        <P>In light of these developments, I met Adi Roche of Chernobyl Children&rsquo;s Project International on 8 September to hear her concerns at first hand.  I explained that I had asked the Ambassador to Moscow, who is also accredited to Belarus, to travel to Minsk on 9 September to register with the Belorussian authorities the Government&rsquo;s strong concern about the suspension of the children&rsquo;s visits in the absence of a formal Agreement.  In addition, at my invitation, the Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires of the Embassy of the Republic of Belarus travelled to Dublin on 11 September.  During meetings with him, it was agreed that we would work with the Belorussian authorities to arrive at an agreement between our two Governments that would provide a framework for such visits.</P>
        <P>Since then, officials in my Department have worked with the Office for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office to prepare a revised version of the draft Agreement presented by the Belorussian authorities.  In addition, on 30 September two officials from my Department met with officials from the Department of Humanitarian Affairs in Minsk to explain Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the draft Agreement.</P>
        <P>A revised draft of an Agreement was forwarded by my Department to the Belorussian authorities on 6 October and we requested that a response should be forthcoming very quickly with a view to concluding an agreement at an early date. It is our strong hope that &mdash; even if negotiations are not fully concluded &mdash; visits by the Chernobyl children to Ireland will be allowed to go ahead over Christmas.</P>

	<P>I met with the British Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, on 11 September when we had substantive discussions on a wide range <Col N="332"/>of European and international issues, including the Lisbon Treaty, Climate Change, the Millennium Development Goals, Zimbabwe, the Middle East, Iran and the conflict between Georgia and Russia. We also briefly touched on the Northern Ireland situation.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Lisbon Treaty, I briefed the Foreign Secretary in detail on the results of the study conducted for the Government following the result of the referendum, and also on plans for the establishment of the Oireachtas sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s future in the European Union.  Our discussion looked forward to next week&rsquo;s European Council, at which the Taoiseach will brief his colleagues on developments since our referendum.  I took the opportunity of the meeting with the Foreign Secretary to thank him for his Government&rsquo;s strong support for Ireland within the EU following the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty in June.</P>
        <P>We reviewed progress towards the formation of a power-sharing government in Zimbabwe &mdash; the meeting took place before the broad agreement reached between Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai, which remains to be implemented.  In regard to the Middle East, we agreed that it was important to maintain such progress as has been made in the Annapolis process, with a view to building on it once political conditions allow.  We discussed the implementation of the six-point peace plan for Georgia brokered by the French EU Presidency, and the future of wider EU-Russia relations.  The Foreign Secretary also briefed me on discussions on the Iranian nuclear issue within the E3 + 3 grouping.  A further UN Security Council resolution has since been agreed.</P>
        <P>Co-operation between our two countries is excellent. It owes much to the close and sustained contact between the Irish and British Governments over the past eleven years of working together, building peace and bringing devolution to Northern Ireland.</P>

	<P>In the period 2006 to 2008, Irish Aid provided multi-annual support to D&oacute;chas, the umbrella group for Irish development NGOs, amounting to &euro;690,000.  D&oacute;chas works to maximise the impact of development NGOs. It promotes a coherent public approach on development issues by its members and helps build public awareness of development challenges.  D&oacute;chas plays an important role in building members&rsquo; capacity to engage with policy issues at national and EU level.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid also provides support directly to small and medium-sized NGOs through the Civil Society Fund and the Micro-Projects Fund.  The total combined budget for these two grant schemes in 2008 amounted to some &euro;41 million. Application forms and full details of these funding schemes are available on the Irish Aid website www.irishaid.gov.ie.</P>
        <P>Currently, I have no plans to establish an umbrella group to deal with individual or small group applications for overseas aid. I believe it is essential that Irish Aid continues to appraise, approve, monitor and evaluate NGO projects, working in partnership with the NGOs, large and small.</P>

        <Quest> the amounts of direct financial aid received by each developing country in each of the past five years under multilateral or bilateral programmes; the amount of debt write-off for each in the same period; the <Col N="333"/>amount and nature of indirect aid throughout; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>For 2008 the Government has provided a total allocation of &euro;769 million to Irish Aid.  A further estimated &euro;130 million will be spent by other Government Departments and through Ireland&rsquo;s allocation to the EU Development Cooperation Budget.  This will bring Ireland&rsquo;s total expenditure on Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) to some &euro;900 million, representing 0.54% of GNP on current estimates.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s ODA comprises both multilateral and bilateral contributions. Multilateral ODA consists of contributions channelled through multilateral and international organisations and these pooled contributions are not reported to Irish Aid on a country-specific basis.  Bilateral ODA consists of contributions made directly by Ireland to developing countries, including contributions made through NGOs, missionary organisations and other bilateral partners.</P>
        <P>Ireland provides assistance to over eighty countries, mainly to Least Developed Countries, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this regard, Ireland places particular emphasis on long term strategic assistance to nine Programme Countries &mdash; Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, Lesotho, Malawi, Vietnam and Timor-Leste.  These countries are amongst the poorest in the world and Ireland&rsquo;s assistance to them is directed primarily to the health, education rural development and governance sectors.</P>
        <P>Comprehensive details of all assistance to our partner countries are set out in the Irish Aid Annual Report, which has been placed in the D&aacute;il Library.  I will ensure that a copy of the 2007 Annual Report is provided to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Ireland also remains closely engaged with the issue of alleviation of the debt burden on developing countries. Moreover, our bilateral assistance to the developing world is exclusively in the form of grants rather than loans.  The Government&rsquo;s financial contributions to debt relief have concentrated on the two main international initiatives in this area, which are implemented primarily by the World Bank and the IMF.  We have provided &euro;20 million to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, towards reducing the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels.  We have also contributed &euro;58.64m to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), to cancel the multilateral debt owed by many of the world&rsquo;s poorest and most indebted countries.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government have progressively and substantially increased the level of funding available for emigrant services in recent years.  These increases have enabled the Emigrant Support Programme, administered by the Irish Abroad Unit of my Department, to provide greater financial support to frontline welfare organisations which assist the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities, including the Safe Home Programme.</P><Col N="334"/>
        <P>My Department continues to be very supportive of the work undertaken by the Safe Home Programme.  The award of a &euro;249,900 grant in April of this year brought the Department&rsquo;s total funding to the organisation since 2003 to over &euro;1,100,000. In 2007, additional Government funding, totalling &euro;72,000, was also awarded to the Safe Home Programme by the Department of Environment and Local Government and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  This substantial funding is testament to the high value which the Government places on the work performed by the organisation in enabling elderly Irish emigrants to return to live in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I can assure t he Deputy that the Government remains committed to supporting frontline welfare agencies and organisations, including the Safe Home Programme.  As the Deputy will appreciate, however, all grant applications for Emigrant Support funding are reviewed on their respective merits each year.</P>

	<P>It is estimated that Ireland&rsquo;s spending on Official Development Assistance (ODA) for 2008 will reach 0.54 % of GNP.  During the 2008 estimates process, the Government allocated &euro;914 million to ODA.  &euro;814 million was allocated to Vote 29 (International Cooperation) of the Department of Foreign Affairs and an estimated &euro;100 million to other Government Departments and through Ireland&rsquo;s allocation to the EU Development Cooperation Budget.  This allocation, based on the then estimated GNP, was made to achieve a target of 0.54% of GNP in 2008.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, in light of the changed economic situation, the Government reviewed current expenditure allocations across all Departments in July.  The overall ODA allocation was revised to &euro;899 million, which however continued to ensure that the target of 0.54% of GNP would be achieved. Moreover, I am confident that this will also ensure that Ireland maintains its position as the sixth most generous per capita donor in the world, which was confirmed by the OECD for 2007.</P>

        <QRef>[34177/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Convention on Cluster Munitions was adopted by consensus by the 107 states that participated at the Dublin Diplomatic Conference hosted by the Government in Croke Park from 19 to 30 May last.  The Convention will be opened for signature at a ceremony to be hosted by the Norwegian Government in Oslo on 3 December.</P>
        <P>As a demonstration of commitment to its early entry into force, the Government is resolved to ratifying the Convention as soon as possible.  To this end the Government last month approved the General Scheme of the Inhumane Munitions Bill and assigned priority to its drafting.  It will be introduced in the Oireachtas very shortly.</P><Col N="335"/>
        <P>The Bill will enable the State to meet its obligations under the Convention by implementing its provisions in domestic law, as necessary, and supplementing them where appropriate.  The Bill will also make further provision for the implementation of the State&rsquo;s obligations under the 1997 Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention.</P>
        <P>The definition of a cluster munition under the Convention is comprehensive and will lead to the prohibition of all cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  The Convention prohibits all cluster munitions that have ever been used in an armed conflict.</P>
        <P>During the negotiations however we remained concerned that new technologies could be developed to circumvent a prohibition of cluster munitions.  The Irish delegation therefore proposed that the Convention also prohibit weapon systems that dispense bomblets that are designed to perform similar tasks to sub-munitions and that produce the same negative humanitarian consequences, but that would not be captured by the definition of a cluster munition.  I am glad to be able to report that Ireland&rsquo;s proposal was accepted in the negotiations and that the Convention prohibits explosive bomblets that are specifically designed to be dispersed or released from dispensers affixed to aircraft in the same way as it does cluster munitions proper.  The new Bill will therefore make appropriate provision for explosive bomblets as well as cluster munitions.</P>
        <P>The issue of interoperability concerns relations between states parties to the new Convention and states that are not party to it.  This was one of the central issues in the negotiations and the Convention makes detailed provision in relation to it.  The Bill will ensure that future participation by the Defence Forces in UN mandated peacekeeping operations will be consistent with the Convention.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the co-operation of all members of the House in ensuring that Ireland can ratify the Convention on 3 December.</P>

	<P>I remain deeply concerned by the situation in Tibet.  Following the disturbing events there in March, and in the lead-up to the Beijing Olympic Games, the situation remained extremely tense and widespread restrictions remained in place on the local population.  Some of those restrictions are gradually being lifted and tourists and other outsiders are being permitted to visit the area.  But many of those involved in the March events are still in detention or imprisoned, some monasteries, monks and others remain subject to heavy restrictions and surveillance, and reports continue to come in of intimidation and ill-treatment.</P>
        <P>As reported to Deputies on many previous occasions, I myself, and my Department, maintain close contact with the Chinese authorities regarding Tibet, as well as supporting efforts at the EU level.  Through these contacts, we continue to underline the importance Ireland attaches to human rights, to freedom of expression and the right to peaceful protest, and to dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama.</P>
        <P>We believe that dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama or his representatives remains the most effective way to achieve the protection of Tibetan culture, identity, religion and human rights, and some measure of autonomy for Tibet within China.  However, the currently unsatisfactory pace and substance of the dialogue process need to be accelerated and upgraded.  We believe that positive developments in the dialogue would benefit not only the Tibetan people, but also China itself, and that it would serve to curb increasing <Col N="336"/>militancy, calls for secession and divergence from the moderate views of the Dalai Lama within Tibet, particularly among the young, which could be dangerous for all concerned.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to keep the situation of Tibet under careful review and high on the agenda in our contacts with China.</P>

	<P>In 2008, ODA expenditure will be the highest in the history of the programme, amounting to almost &euro;900 million or some 0.54% of GNP on current estimates.  Irish Aid delivers assistance to over 90 countries in the developing world. Nine have been designated Programme Countries with a commitment to long term strategic assistance: Tanzania, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia and Malawi, Vietnam and East Timor.</P>
        <P>Support to Programme Countries is framed in agreed country strategies with the aim of assisting in the achievement of national development plans.  These address fundamental human needs including food security, basic education and primary health care.  They also emphasise the central importance for sustainable development of good governance, respect for human rights and transparency and accountability.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Irish Aid, published in 2006, contained a commitment to increase the number of key partner countries from eight to ten, in the medium term.  Malawi was designated Irish Aid&rsquo;s ninth Programme Country in 2007.  An Embassy has now been established in the capital, Lilongwe, and Ireland will provide some &euro;10 million in assistance for Malawi this year.  This support will be targeted in particular at vulnerable communities in the areas of food security, livelihoods and protection against the effects of natural disasters.</P>
        <P>Preliminary work has also been undertaken towards identifying a tenth Programme Country in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  In keeping with the conclusions of the White Paper on Irish Aid, Africa will remain the primary geographic focus for Ireland&rsquo;s development programme.</P>

	<P>Delivering a high quality aid programme as funding expands towards reaching the UN target of 0.7% of GNP on official aid poses challenges at every level of the Irish Aid programme.  The scale of these challenges was recognised in the Government&rsquo;s 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid which proposed a major review of the management and structures of the programme, to ensure that overseas aid is delivered optimally in terms of accountability and quality.</P>
        <P>The review commenced in 2007 and was carried out by external management consultants guided by a Steering Committee comprised of high level officials from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Finance.  The review encompassed a comprehensive examination of Irish Aid&rsquo;s management structures, capacity and delivery systems.  Arrangements to ensure appro<Col N="337"/>priate coordination, including with development partners, and foreign policy coherence were also considered.</P>
        <P>The consultants&rsquo; report was finalised in July 2008 and is currently under active consideration in my Department and the Department of Finance.  It is expected that the recommendations will be submitted to Government in the coming months and, if approved, that an Action Plan will be formulated to implement them over the next two years on a phased basis.</P>

	<P>I proposed to take Questions Nos. 42 and 67.</P>
        <P>I remain deeply concerned at the situation in Darfur, and the ongoing suffering of its people. The fracturing of the main rebel groups over the past year, and the apparent determination of the Government of Sudan to pursue a military solution, at a high price in terms of ongoing suffering for ordinary people, makes the search for peace even more difficult. I welcome the appointment of Djibril Bassol&eacute; as joint AU-UN chief mediator in June 2008, and am hopeful that his committed efforts to bring the two sides together will be successful. So far, however, <Col N="339"/>the process has been disappointingly slow, and a lack of political will is apparent on all sides. Despite these discouraging developments, there is no alternative to a political solution.</P>
        <P>In Darfur, ongoing conflict, including targeted attacks against aid workers and their assets, continues to constitute a major obstacle to humanitarian operations. Since 2006, the Government has committed over &euro;48 million in assistance to the people of Sudan, including Darfur. Through EUFOR Tchad/RCA, which is under the command of an Irish officer, Lieutenant General Pat Nash, the EU is also helping provide security for those Darfuris who have fled across the border into neighbouring Chad.</P>
        <P>Serious human rights abuses against civilians, particularly women and children, have been a constant feature of the Darfur conflict. On 14 July 2008, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) requested that a warrant be issued for the arrest of Sudanese President Al-Bashir on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur. It is now up to the appropriate bodies of the ICC and, where appropriate, the UN to determine what action they intend to take in response to the Prosecutor&rsquo;s request.</P>
        <P>Ireland fully supports the crucial role being played by the ICC in the promotion of international justice, and deeply regrets the lack of co-operation on the part of the Sudanese government with the ICC to date. While the situation in Darfur is very complex, and there is a need to foster any prospects for peace which exist, the reality should be that serious crimes such as those which have been committed in Darfur must not go unpunished.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 54 together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government contains a clear commitment to the expansion of the Aid Programme. We have set a target of spending 0.7% of GNP on Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2012.</P>
        <P>For 2008 the Government has allocated approximately &euro;900 million to ODA. The bulk of this funding &mdash; &euro;769 million &mdash; comes under Vote 29, International Cooperation, which is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, through Irish Aid. A further estimated &euro;130 million will be spent by other Government Departments and through Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU Development Cooperation Budget.</P>
        <P>Expenditure on ODA in 2008 will be the highest in the history of the programme. On current estimates, we expect it will represent 0.54 % of GNP. This level of spending will ensure that Ireland remains one of the most generous donors in the world.</P>
        <P>The Government remains on course to meet the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2012. The Deputy will appreciate that all public expenditure allocations for 2009 are subject to decisions taken in the context of the Budget which the Minister for Finance will present to the House on 14 October.</P><Col N="340"/>
        <P>The spending priorities for Irish Aid will remain as set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid, with a comprehensive focus on the reduction of poverty, in line with the Government&rsquo;s clear commitment to the implementation of the UN Millennium Development Goals.</P>

	<P>Irish Aid provides support to anti-poverty initiatives in Latin America, and elsewhere in the developing world, through a number of funding mechanisms. Total Government support to civil society in Latin America exceeded &euro;16 million in 2007.</P>
        <P>Through the Multi Annual Programme Scheme, (MAPS), Irish Aid has established a strategic and programmatic relationship with key Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) partners. The Scheme ensures predictability of financial support for an agreed programme of development activity. Three organisations supported under MAPS &mdash; Tr&oacute;caire, Christian Aid and Concern &mdash; implement programmes in Latin America amounting to some &euro;6.59 million. The areas covered include governance, human rights, gender, mobilising for justice, sustainable livelihoods programmes, and HIV/AIDS.</P>
        <P>In addition, through the Civil Society Fund, Irish Aid provides grants for smaller NGOs for projects contributing to poverty reduction. In Latin America, the Fund supports a range of NGOs working in areas with high levels of poverty. Priority sectors include human rights, education, health and HIV/AIDS, livelihood security, fair and ethical trade, and water and sanitation. In 2007, the Fund provided &euro;6.98m in support of such NGO programmes in Latin America.</P>
        <P>Irish missionaries carry out important development work in fifteen countries in Latin America. Irish Aid funding is administered through Misean Cara, which was established in 2004, taking over management of existing funding schemes for missionary development work. In 2007, Misean Cara allocated &euro;2.44 million for development work in Latin America, focusing on basic education, primary health care, income generation, urban and rural community development and water and sanitation.</P>
        <P>An additional &euro;134,880 was allocated last year, through our Embassies in Latin America, for local Civil Society activities. Irish Aid has also provided support for organisations working on the protection and recuperation of indigenous land rights. This includes &euro;110,379 towards a three-year year project in Colombia which has been successfully completed this year, and funding for a three-year project focusing on the protection of Mayan indigenous land rights in Guatemala.</P>

        <Quest> the position in Burma, particularly in the view of the first anniversary of the 2007 Saffron Revolution and its subsequent military clampdown as well as the further tragedies suffered in the country due to Cyclone Nargis; and the support of a financial as well as humanitarian and diplomatic kind which Ireland has offered over the past year. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation in Burma remains of major concern. There has been a conspicuous absence of political progress since the Saffron Revolution in September 2007, and repression by the military of monks, political activists and others continues. In May, the military junta pressed ahead with a fundamentally flawed referendum on a new Constitution for Burma. At the same time, they also extended the detention order on Aung San Suu Kyi for a further six months. I immediately condemned this action and renewed the Government&rsquo;s call for her release.</P>
        <P>As regards to the humanitarian situation following Cyclone Nargis, this is still very difficult but, thanks to facilitation efforts by the UN and ASEAN and the generous response of the international community, the Burmese people most affected are being actively assisted in their recovery efforts. In this regard, over &euro;1.35 million in Irish Aid funding was provided to the emergency relief effort, as well as two airlifts of essential humanitarian supplies from our pre-positioned emergency stockpiles in Brindisi, Italy and in the Curragh.</P>
        <P>As I highlighted in my address to the UN General Assembly last month, the continued reluctance by the Burmese authorities to engage seriously over the past twelve months with the Good Offices Mission of the UN Secretary General is gravely disappointing. The Government continues to support actively the work of the Secretary General, his Special Representative, Dr Ibrahim Gambari, and the UN&rsquo;s Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Burma. I believe the roles of the Special Representative, and of the Secretary General personally, are vital to the long-term goals of real democratisation and national reconciliation in Burma, especially in relation to ensuring that the process leading up to the elections promised in 2010 will be as inclusive as possible.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, we have marked not only the first anniversary of the Saffron Revolution but also the twentieth anniversary of the 8-8-88 uprising. As I stated at the time of that commemoration, Ireland remains committed to helping the Burmese people in their struggle for democracy. In pursuit of this goal, the Government has engaged in diplomatic activity at Ministerial and senior official level with Burma&rsquo;s neighbours and in international fora. During my recent visit to the UN, I raised the situation in Burma in the course of discussions with senior UN officials and with the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, who is also deeply concerned about the situation there.</P>
        <P>The Government have also worked to enhance the EU&rsquo;s role in supporting the people of Burma, including securing the extension of sanctions against the regime in December 2007. The Government has ensured that the issue remained high on the Council&rsquo;s agenda throughout the last twelve months, promoting and supporting European Council and GAERC Conclusions on Burma on a number of occasions in 2007 and 2008.</P>
        <P>My Department has also continued to work closely with the Burmese community and friends of Burma in Ireland, including supporting the work of Burma Action Ireland. We have likewise maintained close working relations with the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma (NCGUB) &mdash; Burma&rsquo;s government in exile. In June I launched a comprehensive report on the brutal suppression of Burma&rsquo;s September 2007 public protests, &lsquo;Bullets in the Alms Bowl&rsquo;. This was produced by the NCGUB and funded by my Department.</P>

	<P>Overall, there has been a substantial improvement in the security situation in Iraq over the last 18 months. This has been based both on intensified security actions by Iraqi and international forces, and on internal progress in reconciliation and political accommodation, which we have always stressed as an essential element in resolving Iraq&rsquo;s problems.</P>
        <P>While the level of violence remains unacceptably high, there is no doubt that the improvement on the streets in Iraq has changed the political atmosphere, and provided space in which political action to achieve real inter-communal reconciliation may now be possible. It is essential that this opportunity be fully grasped.</P>
        <P>The US Government has not, as yet, made any statement concerning the future of Camp Ashraf, or Ashraf City, the base of the People&rsquo;s Mujahideen of Iran, which is in an area of Iraq controlled by US forces. However, the progressive handing over of responsibility for security from US to Iraqi forces, which is a welcome development, has led to obvious speculative reports that, in due course, this will also apply to the area containing Camp Ashraf.</P>
        <P>Iraq&rsquo;s elected leaders and parties have always made clear their unhappiness at the continued presence in Iraq of the PMOI, due both to the importance of improving relations with Iran, and to the actions of the PMOI in support of the former regime of Saddam Hussein, including its involvement in attacks on Iraqi civilians.</P>
        <P>The Iraqi authorities have recently restated their determination that the group should leave Iraq. They have not, however, suggested that they be forcibly returned to Iran. Rather, they have suggested that they should move to another country, or countries, and that such a move must be carried out in coordination with the International Committee for the Red Cross.</P>
        <P>While the issues involved are complex, I would agree that the residents of Camp Ashraf should not be forcibly returned to Iran, where they would very probably face a real threat of persecution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Somalia has been without an effective government since 1991, and despite an initial period of stability after Ethiopian troops and Transitional Federal Government (TFG) forces defeated the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC) in December 2006, the situation has worsened catastrophically in the last year. There has been a pattern of fighting in the capital Mogadishu since November 2007, between Ethiopian and TFG forces on the one hand, and clan militias and Islamists on the other hand. An agreement between the TFG and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS) was initialled in Djibouti in June and signed on 19 August. However, despite this agreement, violence by opposition groups has increased since June, and has affected previously stable areas. Violence has intensified further in Mogadishu in September, and over 100 people have been killed there since 22 September.</P>
        <P>Drought, widespread violence and displacement have caused the UN to estimate that 3.2 million Somalis are currently in need of assistance; a forty per cent increase since January. It is feared that this figure will rise even further by the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>The humanitarian situation across Somalia remains grave, particularly in and around Mogadishu. Food shortages and drought have been compounded by escalating violence against civilians and aid-workers, which has made Somalia one of the most dangerous environments for aid <Col N="343"/>workers in the world. This is the primary challenge for all NGOs and aid agencies in seeking to respond to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Somalia. Security issues include random violence, piracy, kidnapping, landmines and general banditry.</P>
        <P>Since 2006, Ireland has contributed more than &euro;17 million in humanitarian assistance to Somalia. Thus far in 2008, Ireland has provided &euro;5.65 million in humanitarian assistance. In addition to our financial support, we have made three successive deployments of members of the Rapid Response Corps (based in Nairobi) to assist UNHCR in their operations for Somalia.</P>
        <P>The serious threat posed by piracy to the effective delivery of humanitarian aid is a cause for great concern, with so many in Somalia being dependent on food aid delivered through the World Food Programme (WFP). The EU is playing its part in the international efforts to combat the problem of piracy and EU Member States have decided to co-ordinate their maritime action in response to this issue and facilitate the escort of WFP ships into Mogadishu.</P>
        <P>My officials are in continuing contact with a range of agencies and NGOs in order to monitor the situation, particularly on the issue of humanitarian access to those needing assistance.</P>

	<P>Together with our EU partners, Ireland has been monitoring preparations for the parliamentary elections planned in Bangladesh for December 2008.</P>
        <P>An election observation Exploratory Mission was deployed to Bangladesh between 15th and 28th June last to assess whether re-deployment of the European Union Election Observation Mission (EOM), suspended on 11th January 2007 when the elections scheduled for last year were cancelled, would be useful, feasible and advisable.   The deployment of the Exploratory Mission followed the renewal of the invitation from the Bangladesh Election Commission (BEC) to observe the elections.</P>
        <P>During its deployment, the Exploratory Mission met representatives of the state and electoral authorities, as well as representatives of major political parties, civil society, the media and the international community. It also took notice of the findings of the previous Exploratory Mission conducted in September 2006.</P>
        <P>Several of the 2006-2007 EOM&rsquo;s key recommendations have been followed up on by the BEC, or their implementation is underway, including the production of an electronic voter list; enhancing BEC&rsquo;s independence; mandatory registration of political parties; the display of results at polling station level; a fresh delineation of constituencies; and establishing a specific timeframe for the adjudication of electoral complaints. At the same time, progress remains outstanding on issues such as the involvement of civil society in observing the voter registration process; a women&rsquo;s quota and the role of the media.</P>
        <P>Overall the Exploratory Mission was broadly positive about the feasibility and usefulness of an Election Observation Mission, subject to the easing of the State of Emergency which was declared at the time the elections were cancelled last year, and the resolution of certain election-related rights. A decision regarding the deployment of the mission is due shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 69 together.</P>
        <P>As I have reported to the House on a number of previous occasions, the Government is seriously concerned about the political, security and humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka.  I am particularly troubled at the extent of civilian casualties, the increasing numbers of internally displaced families and the disruption to the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the needy which have resulted from both the government&rsquo;s military offensive and from acts of terrorism on the part of the LTTE and others.</P>
        <P>This is particularly the case since the decision taken in January by the Government of Sri Lanka to pull out of the 2002 Ceasefire Agreement, to terminate formally the peace process and to seek to resolve the Tamil issue through military force.  But, equally, we remain deeply concerned about the widespread wanton acts of terrorism and violence carried out by the LTTE (&lsquo;Tamil Tigers&rsquo;) and other groups, including this week&rsquo;s suicide bombing in Anuradhapura.  Such actions have resulted in the EU and others in the international community listing the LTTE as a terrorist organisation and, therefore, ceasing contact with them.</P>
        <P>In the Government&rsquo;s contacts with the Government of Sri Lanka and in all our international contacts regarding Sri Lanka, we have consistently expressed the view that there can be no military solution to the Tamil issue.  It is the Government&rsquo;s clear view that the legitimate aspirations of Tamil people for their ethnic, cultural and religious rights to be safeguarded, and for some form of autonomy, should be the subject of peaceful, national dialogue and negotiation, with a view to reaching a comprehensive political agreement that will address the aspirations of both Tamils and the majority Sinhalese community in Sri Lanka.</P>
        <P>This was the objective of the currently defunct ceasefire and peace process, which was facilitated by Norway, backed up by the Nordic Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission, and supported with development assistance by the Tokyo Conference on Reconstruction and Development of Sri Lanka.  I believe that it is vital that every effort is made to try to reinvigorate this peace process.</P>
        <P>We remain strongly supportive of the role Norway has played and we very much welcome its commitment to continue contacts with both sides in hopes of encouraging them back to the negotiating table.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, we will continue to provide practical, humanitarian support to the people of all communities in Sri Lanka. Since 2005, Irish Aid has provided more than &euro;5.3 million for humanitarian and development activities in Sri Lanka.  This includes significant emergency assistance provided in the aftermath of the tsunami, and continuing support to the World Food Programme in Sri Lanka.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s official programme of development assistance, Irish Aid, has as its overarching objectives poverty reduction and sustainable development.  Africa remains the principal geographic focus for Irish Aid, containing as it does 34 of the world&rsquo;s least developed countries.  In this regard, seven of our nine Programme Countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa &mdash; Tanzania, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia and Malawi. </P>
        <P>In recent years Ireland and other donors have moved towards a more programmatic approach to aid, aligned with the national planning of partner countries.  Priorities and strategies for engagement are based on the particular circumstances in each country.  These priorities are reflected in Country Strategy Papers, which are now in place for each Programme Country.</P>
        <P>Within this overall context, our development priorities are focused primarily on basic needs, including in the key social sectors of health and education, and the fight against HIV/AIDS.  We also focus on the productive sectors, including rural development, the private sector and support for livelihoods.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid also places a particular emphasis on building good governance in its partner countries.

	<P>Irish Aid has in place rigorous accounting and audit controls that recognise the various types of risk inherent in delivering a large scale and multi-faceted aid programme in difficult and challenging environments.</P>
        <P>The Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for overseeing the internal audit function, which includes Irish Aid.  This unit is staffed by professionals and they carry out and oversee a range of audit, evaluation and Value for Money review activities that are appropriate to the various components of the aid programme using a risk-based approach.  Clear priority is given to the audit of expenditure in partner countries where the risks are judged to be highest.</P>
        <P>The audit strategy embraces four separate, though very complementary, approaches:</P>
        <P el="5">(a) <Miles com="ix" />Work carried out directly by Irish Aid&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit, and by our internal auditors based at Missions in the field;</P>
       <P el="5">(b) <Miles com="ix" />Work carried out by internationally reputable audit firms commissioned by Irish Aid;</P>
        <P el="5">(c) <Miles com="ix" />Joint donor funded audits of specific programmes and</P>
        <P el="5">(d) <Miles com="ix" />Audit reports obtained from partner organisations (e.g. those carried out by National Audit Offices, UN bodies and by Non-Governmental Organisations).</P>
        <P FLI="0">Internal auditors, based in our Missions in the field, implement an audit programme which consists of the independent examination of partner organisations that receive Irish Aid funding.  In addition the internal auditors actively review the controls in place at our Missions.  The Missions are also audited annually by internationally reputable audit firms.</P>
        <P>NGO partners funded by Irish Aid under the Multi Annual Programme Scheme or the Civil Society Fund are required to submit their annual audited financial statements.  The Evaluation and Audit Unit also conducts its own internal audit and review work of NGO partners, as part of its evaluation and audit work programme.</P>
        <P>In addition to these robust internal systems, the Department has an independent Audit Committee which reports to the Secretary General.  It provides an independent appraisal of audit reports and of the Department&rsquo;s audit and evaluation arrangements.  The Committee meets with the Secretary General and annually with the Comptroller and Auditor General. It also publishes an annual report on its work.</P>
        <P>Regular reviews of the overall audit approach, audit work programmes and resources are undertaken by management to ensure that developments in audit keep abreast of the challenges posed by the expanding programme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 74 and 166 together.</P>
        <P>More than three weeks after the signing of a power-sharing agreement between Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s ZANU-PF party, and the Tsvangirai and Mutambara factions of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), there has still been no agreement on forming a Government, and the situation in Zimbabwe remains deeply worrying.  Although political violence has greatly diminished, it has not yet stopped.  The rate of inflation is almost impossible to calculate, but has now reached unimaginable levels &mdash; one US think-tank estimates that it reached 531 billion per cent by the end of September.  The World Food Programme estimates that 3.8 million people will require food assistance in October, and that this figure will rise to 5.1 million in January 2009 at its peak.</P>
        <P>EU Foreign Ministers stated after our meeting of 15 September that the EU stands ready to support a transitional government which is taking steps to restore democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe.  That commitment stands, and the EU very much hopes that ongoing dialogue will soon result in the formation of a government of national unity which is credible and reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people, as expressed at the 29 March elections.  Ireland supports a co-ordinated international approach to addressing Zimbabwe&rsquo;s problems, once an administration is in place in Harare which is committed to working with us to rebuild the country economically and politically.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, however, the EU is continuing to act on our concern for the suffering of the ordinary people of Zimbabwe at this very difficult time.  The European Commission has allocated an additional &euro;10 million in relief assistance for people affected by the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe, while Irish aid to Zimbabwe for the period 2006 to 2008 (to date) amounts to approx &euro;25m.</P>
        <P>Zimbabwe is again on the agenda for the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council next Monday, 13 October.  Given the disappointing rate of progress in the talks on forming a Transition Government, I do not believe that my colleagues and I will be in a position to lift the EU restrictive measures on the Zimbabwean leadership.  We will of course review what we can do to assist our African partners in bringing the ongoing negotiations to a successful conclusion, so that we can begin the real task of working with Zimbabweans to restore peace, stability, and sustainable economic development.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the recent increase in food insecurity in Ethiopia which is currently facing its most vulnerable period since the early 1980s because of a combination of food price inflation and drought.  A number of regions in Ethiopia are particularly at risk because the cumulative effect of repeated shocks of this kind have left them especially vulnerable and without any means of coping. </P>
        <P>While there had been some reports that the Government were initially less than frank about the real situation in some regions or districts, my understanding is that they are now more open about the seriousness of the situation.</P>
        <P>My colleague Miche&aacute;l Martin T.D., Minister for Foreign Affairs, raised the situation in Ethiopia with the UN Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, John Holmes, when they met on 26 September.  The Under Secretary-General had just returned from a visit to Ethiopia and Minister Martin urged him to continue to provide every possible assistance and to maintain a careful watching brief on developments over the coming period.</P>
        <P>Ethiopia is a partner country for Irish Aid and we are maintaining a particular focus within our programme on the issue of food security.  Of our planned &euro;36 million programme country budget this year, over &euro;11 million is for the Productive Safety Nets Programme which provides cash and/or food to vulnerable households in return for work on projects targeted at reducing the vulnerability of their communities.  Following the food crisis this year an additional &euro;2 million from the programme country budget has been allocated for food security initiatives.  In addition to the Country Programme, we have provided more than &euro;2.1 million in humanitarian funding through a number of Irish NGOs to support the food insecure in Ethiopia.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am deeply concerned about the situation in Afghanistan.  As was the case when I last addressed this issue in the House on 1 May, there are very clear difficulties regarding security, human rights, governance and rule of law issues, and the production of narcotics. </P>
        <P>The security situation remains a particular cause for concern.  In his most recent report on Afghanistan entitled &ldquo;The Situation in Afghanistan and its implications for international peace and security&rdquo;, released on 23 September, the UN Secretary General concludes that it has deteriorated markedly over the last six months.  The influence of the insurgency has expanded <Col N="349"/>beyond the traditionally volatile areas and has increased in provinces neighbouring Kabul.  Incidents stemming from cross-border activities from Pakistan have increased significantly.  Another worrying development is that attacks on aid-related targets and NGOs have become more frequent and more deadly.  Tragically, the tactics of the insurgency, as well as military operations, have caused the number of civilian casualties to rise sharply.</P>
        <P>On 22 September, the UN Security Council unanimously extended the mission of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan for another year and called for it to be strengthened in the face of increased violence and terrorism from the Taliban, Al-Qaida and drug smugglers.  It urged ISAF and other partners to continue training Afghan national security forces towards the goal of setting up self-sufficient and ethnically balanced national forces to provide security and the rule of law.</P>
        <P>The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan has also deteriorated, in part due to the on-going conflict.  The most pressing humanitarian problem is that drought and high global food prices have created food shortages affecting one sixth of the country&rsquo;s population.</P>
        <P>The Secretary General has, however, also identified recent positive developments.  The Paris Conference on 12 June launched the Afghan National Development Strategy (ANDS) which, together with the Paris Declaration, establishes a road-map for future efforts by the Government of Afghanistan and the international community to provide for the security and prosperity of the Afghan people.  In addition to seeking international endorsement of the ANDS, the key aim of the Conference was to redefine the programme of support for Afghanistan and to encourage increased Afghan ownership of the reconstruction process.  A total of $21 billion was pledged by donors. Ireland pledged &euro;9 million for relief, reconstruction and development in Afghanistan over the two-year period 2008-9.</P>
        <P>The mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) was renewed in March.</P>
        <P>A new EU Special Representative for Afghanistan, Mr. Ettore Francesco Sequi, took up duty on 1 September and will take forward the implementation of EU policy in Afghanistan.  I wish him every success in his new appointment.</P>
        <P>For its part, Ireland has allocated over &euro;15 million in relief, recovery and development assistance to Afghanistan since 2005.  In addition, seven members of the Irish Defence Forces are serving in non-combat roles with ISAF in Kabul.</P>

        <P>In relation to the recent expulsion from Bolivia of the US Ambassador to that country, and the subsequent reciprocal expulsion of the Bolivian Ambassador to the US, this is a bilateral matter between the two countries in question.  It is clearly related to the ongoing political crisis in Bolivia, which I hope can be resolved through peaceful and constitutional means.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Wherever it is feasible and effective to do so, Irish Aid is committed to working through existing national systems, so as to reinforce good governance and avoid undermining national capacity.  This approach is recognised as best practice and is pursued by all those donors who have acceded to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, including Ireland. </P>
        <P>No Irish Aid funding goes directly to the Government of Ethiopia via direct or general budget support.  Rather, it goes through the dedicated distribution and delivery systems (health, education etc) which have been built up over many years.  The funding that we do provide is ring-fenced for its intended purposes and is channelled to recipients using sectoral Ministries, or regional or local government channels.  For example, Irish Aid supports the provision of basic services in health and education and also social &ldquo;safety-nets&rdquo; programmes which are vital to saving the lives and livelihoods of millions of Ethiopians.</P>
        <P>Effective and responsible donors and NGOs must take account of local authorities and systems. For example, when we train teachers, we must use the training systems and institutions, colleges etc. that are in place nationally.  It would be a total waste of money, and it would be unsustainable in the long term, if we were to try to create a parallel system. NGOs and voluntary organisations also work with local and national systems.</P>
        <P>In 2007, &euro;32m was allocated to Ethiopia through the bilateral country programme and a further &euro;36m has been allocated for 2008.  In addition, in 2007 Irish Aid provided over &euro;7m, mostly for multi-annual funding to major Irish NGOs, but also to other civil society projects.  A further &euro;9.1m has been committed to date in 2008. In 2007 and 2008, &euro;2.5m was allocated for humanitarian aid to Concern, Goal and the World Food programme in Ethiopia.</P>

	<P>Ireland is closely engaged with the issue of alleviation of the debt burden on developing countries.  The Government has provided considerable resources to initiatives designed to ease or cancel the debt burden.  Moreover, our bilateral assistance to the developing world is exclusively in the form of grants rather than loans. </P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s financial contributions to debt relief have concentrated on the two major international initiatives on the issue.  We have paid &euro;20 million to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, towards reducing the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels. We have contributed &euro;58.64m to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), to cancel the multilateral debt owed by many of the world&rsquo;s poorest and most indebted countries.  Each of these initiatives is implemented by the World Bank and the IMF.  The MDRI also involves the African Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.</P><Col N="351"/>
        <P>Irish Aid maintains a close dialogue with Irish NGOs on the debt issue, but has not provided assistance to the Jubilee Debt Campaign, a British-based coalition of groups and organisations established to influence British Government policy on debt.  There are no plans to provide such assistance.  I strongly appreciate the work of NGOs in highlighting the issue of the debt burden.  The Government remains fully committed to playing its part in tackling the issue urgently and effectively.</P>

	<P>All locally recruited staff in Irish Missions abroad, including those based in the other EU Member States, are treated equitably regardless of nationality.  Local staff are remunerated at the mid to upper end of local salary norms and are employed in compliance with the applicable labour legislation.  Where Irish statutory minimum standards exceed local entitlements, Irish standards are applied. </P>
        <P>As regards Embassies in Ireland, the general position is that under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, it is the duty of all persons enjoying privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State.  Nevertheless, in the case of an employment law dispute involving an Embassy located in Ireland and a locally-recruited employee of that Embassy, the international law doctrine of sovereign immunity may apply in certain circumstances to deny the jurisdiction of the Irish courts.  However, even where this is the case, the employment rights and standards at issue may still be enforceable in the courts of the foreign country concerned, if that state subscribes to those rights and standards.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my combined written answer in the D&aacute;il Debates for 24 September 2008 to Questions Nos. 136, 141 and 159.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Statistics</i></P>
        <P el="0">In 2007 a total of 67 workplace fatalities was reported to the Health and Safety Authority compared to 48 to date (7 October) in 2008 and compared to a total of 51 fatalities in the whole of 2006.</P>
        <P el="5">There were over 7,000 non-fatal work injuries overall reported to the Authority in 2007 compared to over 5,000 non-fatal injuries to date in 2008.</P>
        <P el="5">The NACE industrial and economic sector classification system changed in January 2008. Therefore, a direct comparison on the sector codes for each year is not possible as the sectors represented by some codes have changed significantly. However, the figures for five key sectors have been extracted from the data and are on the following table.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Health and Safety Authority</i></P>
        <P el="0">Operational responsibility for the enforcement of occupational health and safety policy and the promotion of a general awareness of occupational health and safety issues rests with the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
        <P el="5">Details of the Authority&rsquo;s planned activities, in pursuit of its operational remit, are contained in its annual Programme of Work 2008 which can be accessed at the Authority&rsquo;s website (http://publications.hsa.ie/index.asp?locID=17&amp;docID=268).  I expect to receive the Authority&rsquo;s proposed Programme of Work for 2009 before the end of this month.</P>
      <P el="10"><i>Construction and Agriculture</i></P>
        <P el="0">It is obvious, from the statistics, that both construction and agriculture are the leading high risk sectors. It is my view that the Authority should prioritise its efforts in accordance with the sectoral risk profiles and this is, in fact, how the Authority operates in practice.</P>
        <P el="5">For my part, I will continue to use all opportunities to drive home the health and safety message. For example, on the construction side, I formally launched the Construction Safety Partnership Plan 2008-2010 on 17 June 2008.  The overall aim of the partnership is to achieve the highest possible standard of safety, health and welfare in Irish construction.  The Construction Safety Partnership (CSP) includes representatives of the Construction Industry Federation (CIF), Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), Health and Safety Authority (HSA) and other relevant Agencies and Government Departments.</P>
        <P>On the agriculture side, I attended and addressed the first All Island Farm Safety Conference in Monaghan in June of this year.  This conference was co-hosted by the Health and Safety Authority along with the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI).  The <Col N="353"/>conference attracted over 200 from North and South to hear both national and international experts present on safety strategies and initiatives on farm safety.</P>
        <P>I also, participated in the Authority&rsquo;s awareness initiative at the recent National Ploughing Championships in Kilkenny.  I have encouraged the Authority to continue and develop its partnership with Teagasc and to follow through on the development and distribution of the Farm Safety Code of Practice which was distributed to 160,000 farm households in December 2006.  This joint initiative focuses on increasing the use of this Code of Practice and take up of half day training courses on the Code of Practice available at Teagasc Advisory Centres.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the Health and Safety Authority is proactive in encouraging safety in all workplaces and have prioritised its initiatives in the agriculture and construction sectors.  However, it is always important to remember that the Authority, on its own, cannot deliver health and safety in every workplace.  Ultimately, health and safety in the workplace can only be delivered by those who control and work in each workplace.</P>

	<P>The fact that Dell is undertaking a fundamental review of its manufacturing operations and global business model has been in the public domain for some time.  It is standard IDA practice, where any of its client companies is undertaking restructuring of this type, to engage with the company with a view to mitigating the impact on the company&rsquo;s Irish operations.  I can confirm that IDA has been engaged in extensive discussions with the company at the highest level.  I have been fully briefed on these discussions as they have occurred.  I need hardly say that such contacts always proceed on a confidential basis and it is vitally important, if the best possible outcome for the Irish operations is to be secured, that confidentiality is respected. </P>

	<P>The Motorised Transport Grant is a grant towards the purchase/adaptation of a vehicle by a person with a severe disability where the vehicle is essential for him or her to retain employment.  Persons with a disability who qualify but are incapable of driving and who have to be driven to and from work are also considered eligible for a grant provided that they are driven by another named person to and from work. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The grant may also be provided other than for retaining employment, (in exceptional circumstances) to a person with a severe disability who lives in very isolated circumstances.  The person&rsquo;s disability must prevent them from using public transport and they must have serious transport difficulties.  However, the applicant still needs to meet the medical criteria, the means test, he or she cannot be in receipt of the Mobility Allowance and the calculation of the amount of grant will factor in any tax relief received under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers Tax Relief Scheme (administered by the Revenue Commissioners).</P>

	<P>&ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;- the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy provides a framework for action to develop modern, high quality mental health services over a seven to ten year period.  The Report estimates that 332 community mental health teams are required to deliver the proposed community-based mental health service.  Each multidisciplinary team will include the core skills of psychiatry, nursing, social work, clinical psychology, and occupational therapy.  To implement this, substantial change is required in the organisation and delivery of mental health services.

	<P>&ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.  The Report recommends inter alia that a plan to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals should be drawn up and implemented and that the resources released by these closures should be protected for reinvestment in the mental health service.  It is understood that the Health Service Executive (HSE) has disposed of a small number of assets since the launch of the Report in January 2006.  </P>
        <P>As the HSE has primary responsibility for implementing this recommendation, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular issues raised by the Deputy.

        <P>Capital provision has been included by the HSE within its Capital Plan 2008-2013 for the enhancement of Emergency Department facilities in line with the recommendations of the Emergency Task Force.  The funding is to be targeted at upgrading and extending existing departments and the development of  new departments.  A number of the new Emergency Departments have provision for minor injury clinics at hospitals including Connolly, Cork University, St Vincent&rsquo;s, St James&rsquo;s and South Tipperary General Hospitals.</P>
        <P>Outside of Dublin, funding was provided for the expansion of the minor injury service at St. John&rsquo;s Limerick, and the provision of a minor injuries unit at Waterford Regional Hospital.  These services are fully operational.</P>
        <P>In line with the recommendations of the Teamwork Report &ldquo;Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards&rdquo;, the HSE is also committed to the development of Minor Injury Units in local hospitals in the North East.  The first of these units is to be developed at Monaghan Hospital.  Other units are to open at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan and Louth County Hospital, Dundalk.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to provide an additional 1,500 public acute hospital beds.  Approximately 1,000 of these will be provided through the co-location initiative and the balance through the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s (HSE&rsquo;s) capital plan, which is part of the National Development Plan.  The co-location initiative aims to deliver approximately 1,000 of these beds for public patients through the development of private hospitals on public sites.  The intention is to transfer private activity to those hospitals thereby freeing up capacity for public patients.  The Board of the Health Service Executive (HSE) has approved preferred bidder status for the development of  co-located hospitals at the following six sites:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Beaumont Hospital,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Cork University Hospital,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Limerick Regional Hospital,</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Waterford Regional Hospital and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Sligo General Hospital.</P><Col N="365"/>
<P FLI="0" el="5">Project Agreements for the Beaumont, Cork and Limerick sites have been signed.  The necessary preparatory work for Project Agreements in respect of St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Waterford Regional Hospital and Sligo General Hospital is proceeding.  </P>
        <P>Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, which are also participating in the co-location initiative, are at an earlier stage of the procurement process.  A tender in respect of Connolly Hospital has been received and is under consideration.  Work is being undertaken to finalise the Invitation to Tender (ITT) for Tallaght Hospital.</P>
        <P>In 2007 the HSE commissioned an independent review of acute bed capacity requirements for Ireland until the year 2020.  The report produced  reaffirms the case for continuing to increase our focus on a primary and community care model.  The review recommended that Ireland develop an Integrated Model of Care system.  This overall strategic direction has already been adopted by other developed countries, such as Denmark and Canada.  The review forms a basis for discussion with key stakeholders on how best to plan for the provision of public health care to 2020.</P>
        <P>My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to furnish the Deputy with the specific information requested on progress on the additional public acute hospital beds and day places being provided under the Executive&rsquo;s capital programme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 111 together.</P>
        <P>All persons aged 70 and over have had a statutory entitlement to a medical card since July 2001 and, therefore, it was not necessary to assess means.  Information provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to my Department indicates that on 30th September 2008 there were <Col N="369"/>138,269 persons aged 70 and over who had a medical card which attracts the higher GP capitation fee of &euro;640.  A GP capitation payment of between &euro;139.59 and &euro;244.64 (depending on the person&rsquo;s age, gender and distance from their residence to the GP surgery) applies in respect of a medical card for a person reaching the age of 70 years who previously held a medical card.</P>
        <P>Details of the number of medical card holders are provided to my Department by the Health Service Executive (HSE) on a net basis showing the balance after new cards have been issued and other cards, as appropriate, have been deleted from the Executive&rsquo;s database.  The HSE has provided the following information in relation to the number of higher GP capitation medical card holders at the end of each year from 2001 to 2007.</P>

        <Quest> the number of elderly people or patients awaiting funding for nursing home beds per county and per Health Service Executive area, specifically in north Dublin City and County and in total here; her plans in the short term to address the shortfall in funding in this area which is causing hardship and clogging up acute hospitals through no fault of the patients who cannot leave hospital; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>In 2007, expenditure by the HSE on nursing home subventions was almost &euro;205 million.  This year the Government has redirected an additional &euro;25 million from the overall allocation in respect of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, for the purpose of nursing home supports, including subvention.  This includes &euro;13 million for the provision of 200 contract beds.</P><Col N="370"/>
        <P>In addition, the long-term residential care fast-track initiative, which commenced in 2007 and is continuing until 2009, aims to provide 860 new intermediate and long-term residential care beds.  The latest information received from the Health Service Executive indicates that 188 beds were provided in 2007 and that 325 and 347 are to be provided in 2008 and 2009 respectively.  Of these, 75 are in the HSE West, 316 are in the HSE South, 242 are in the HSE Dublin North East and 227 are in the HSE Mid-Leinster.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy has asked about the number of elderly people or patients awaiting funding for nursing home beds per county and per Health Service Executive area.  Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised.  I am referring the Deputy&rsquo;s query to the HSE for direct reply.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 128 together.</P>
        <P>Negotiations are currently at an advanced stage with a commercial consortium, which was selected following an E.U. tender procedure, as the preferred tenderer for the design, construction, finance and maintenance of the proposed prison facilities at Thornton Hall as a PPP.</P><Col N="373"/>
        <P>It is a matter for the commercial consortium, under the PPP process, to arrange the funding of the project.  Obviously, closure of the contract cannot be completed without the necessary funding being in place and it would not be appropriate, for commercial and procurement reasons, for me to comment on the specific financial funding aspects of the PPP contract negotiations.</P>
        <P>For all PPP projects a Public Sector Benchmark is determined in advance of the project being tendered.  The Public Sector Benchmark is a monetary value that represents a risk adjusted cost, over the construction and 25 year maintenance period, to the Sponsoring Agency of delivering the project using &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; public sector procurement.</P>
        <P>Before the contract is awarded the final cost must be within the budget (capital envelope) allocated to the project and be below the Public Sector Benchmark.  The National Development Finance Agency provides a letter to my Department indicating that the project represents Value for Money when compared to this Public Sector Benchmark, if this is their opinion.</P>
        <P>In the current fiscal situation facing the country it is important that we all strive to reduce costs, live within our budgets and avoid any cost increases.  The Irish Prison Service is currently examining all issues that have arisen in relation to the project and in this regard all options available are under review.</P>
        <P>The bidder must meet all the criteria, including the financial criteria, in the tender.  Although a preferred tenderer was selected, there are other tenderers and other viable options which can still be considered if for any reason the negotiations referred to are not successfully concluded.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 124 together.</P>
        <P>It is not the general practice of the Visa Office to issue multiple journey visas unless a compliant travel history to Ireland in the recent past has been shown.  In that context, a Visa Officer would normally expect to be satisfied that the conditions of at least two previous visas has been observed.</P>
        <P>There are two main categories of visa &mdash; a &lsquo;C&rsquo; visa is for a stay of a maximum of 90 days, a &lsquo;D&rsquo; visa is for a longer stay.  Where a &lsquo;D&rsquo; visa has been approved and a stay in excess of 90 days is intended, the applicant is required to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB.)</P>
        <P>Each visa application is considered on its individual merits, with the onus resting on the applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer as to why a visa should be granted.  It should be borne in mind that a visa is merely a pre-entry clearance to seek permission to enter the State &mdash; no automatic right of entry is conferred.  Whether the person is permitted to enter and the exact period for which s/he is allowed to remain is a matter for the Immigration Officer at the port of entry.  The overwhelming majority of family visitors and tourists should find current visa and entry clearance arrangements adequate for their needs and consistent with the immigration policy of most other countries similar to Ireland.  It is unlikely that such visitors would wish to become involved in the GNIB registration process.  It is more likely that people wishing to come to Ireland for a period in excess of 90 days have something other than a visit planned and the &lsquo;D&rsquo; visa caters to their needs.</P>

This was intended as a once off initiative for a period of one year and &euro;3 million was allocated to it to be administered by Pobal.  Subsequent to the original allocation of &euro;3 million, I allocated a further &euro;1 million in 2007 to fund an additional number of NGOs and Partnerships, again to be administered by Pobal.  In my statement on integration strategy and diversity management, Migration Nation, I announced the establishment of new funding lines to promote integration.

	<P>The organisation to which the question refers received monies from a special integration initiative introduced in 2006.  This provided for seed-funding in relation to integration initiatives for legally-resident immigrants.  As was made clear in the official guidelines for this special fund, support was provided on a once-off basis.</P>
        <P>In my statement on integration strategy and diversity management, Migration Nation, I announced the establishment of new funding lines to promote integration.  One of these funding lines is for sporting bodies.  In Migration Nation, I stated that the time seems right to support the integration of migrants by making funding available to national sporting organisations to help them implement integration plans in their organisations.  I went on to say that, as funding is necessarily limited, the intention is to provide it to the bodies with the greatest potential to involve large numbers of migrants in their activities.  I am about to allocate monies to such bodies.  I would suggest that the organisation referred to in the question should liaise with these bodies in relation to programmes which it wishes to promote and I am prepared to consider funding in that context.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for a declaration of refugee status in the State on 5th January, 2005.  Her application was refused and a deportation order was made in respect of her on 15th September, 2005.</P>
        <P>The individual submitted an application for subsidiary protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006, S.I. No. 518 of 2006 (&rsquo;the Regulations&rsquo;) on 24th January, 2007.  She was informed on 27th February, 2007 that her application was invalid and could not be considered as she was a person in respect of whom a deportation order was signed prior to the coming into force of the Regulations on 10th October, 2006.  Judicial review proceedings challenging this decision were instituted on 20th April, 2007.</P>
        <P>These judicial review proceedings were settled following the judgement of the High Court in the cases of Djolo and Hila, where it was determined that under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006, S.I. No. 518 of 2006, it is open to me to exercise discretion to accept and consider applications for subsidiary protection from persons who do not have an automatic right to apply but who have identified new facts or circumstances which demonstrate a change of position from that which pertained at the time the deportation order was made.</P>
        <P>The individual in question submitted an application pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 on 26th November, 2007, for my predecessor to exercise discretion to accept and consider an application for subsidiary protection from her.  Following consideration of the material submitted, the application was refused and the person was notified of this decision on 14th March, 2008.</P>
        <P>The applicant instituted judicial review proceedings on 31st March 2008 challenging the decision to refuse to exercise discretion to consider an application for subsidiary protection.  As the matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.</P>

The Immigration Division wrote to the person concerned on 25 September 2008 informing her that, as she had not been granted a declaration of Refugee status, the Immigration Division was not in a position to issue her with a 1951 UN Convention Travel Document.  However, the letter also stated that the Immigration Division may be able to facilitate the person in question with a temporary Travel Document to travel for the purpose referred to.</P>
        <P>The Spanish Embassy have advised that they cannot grant a visa for travel to Spain on a temporary Travel Document.  Should the person concerned wish to apply for a temporary Travel Document for travel to another EU State for the purpose of medical treatment, she should advise the Travel Document Section of my Department.  The Embassy of the proposed country of destination should be contacted prior to application to ensure that travel to that country is possible using a temporary Travel Document.</P>

        <P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 11 May 2005.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 12 June 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was notified, by letter dated 31 January 2008, of his entitlement to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I.

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The current escalation in world food prices has highlighted the importance of food security.  The establishment of the Hunger Task Force was a key recommendation of the White Paper on Irish Aid which was published before the onset of the current crisis.  We established it because we knew from our people on the ground in developing countries that hunger was increasing &mdash; particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and that many countries would fail to achieve the Millennium Hunger Goal which is &ldquo;to reduce by half the proportion of people suffering from hunger by 2015&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Hunger Task Force submitted its report on 25 September to the Taoiseach at the recent UN Millennium Summit in New York.  I would like to pay tribute to our former colleague Joe Walsh who did a splendid job in chairing this group of national and international experts and to record my gratitude to every member of the Task Force for their diligent work in producing this report.  The report has been circulated to all members of the Oireachtas and copies placed in the library.</P>
        <P>The Report makes disturbing reading.  It is a disgrace that in 2008 there are more than 862 million people who do not have enough to eat.  At the presentation of the report, Bono, who <Col N="384"/>was a member of the Task Force, pointed out that this figure was already out of date, and that the current figure is approaching 900 million and rising &mdash; driven by the continuing escalation in global food prices.</P>
        <P>The report of the Task Force is timely and I welcome its focus on three key areas:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To follow through on commitments made by all Governments, both donor Governments and Governments of developing countries and to increase the priority given to hunger in the aid programme</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to target smallholder agricultural productivity; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to promote effective actions to counter maternal and infant under-nutrition.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As an initial response I am establishing a new section which, inter alia, will have a special dedicated focus on food security tasked with advancing our work on addressing hunger.</P>
        <P>Hunger is a complex issue and the Task Force have made detailed recommendations.  Our first task will be to carry out a careful analysis of the recommendations, and of the extent to which current aid programming is responding to the many facets of hunger.  Once that exercise has been completed, we will be in a position to plan how we can strengthen our efforts to address the root causes of hunger, with a view to making a real and lasting contribution to the abolition of hunger from our world.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I remain deeply concerned at the situation in Darfur, and the ongoing suffering of its people.  As a result of ongoing violence, the broader humanitarian situation in Darfur continues to be characterised by forced movement of civilians, continuing increases in internally displaced persons (IDPS) and rising tension in camps. </P>
        <P>Ireland and our European Union colleagues are particularly concerned that humanitarian aid has stopped in many areas, in particular Jebel Marra.  The European Union has called on all the parties to unconditionally honour their cease-fire commitments, and to abide by international humanitarian law, Human Rights Conventions and the resolutions of the Security Council.  In particular, humanitarian workers and the United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) must have free access to these areas, and UNAMID must be free to carry out its civilian protection mandate.  The international community must of course go beyond alleviating the symptoms of this humanitarian crisis to address its causes, and the EU and Ireland fully support UN and African Union efforts to bring about a lasting peace.</P>
        <P>Through the military mission, EUFOR Tchad/RCA under the operational command of Irish Lieutenant General Pat Nash, the EU is also helping provide security for those Darfuris who have fled across the border into neighbouring Chad.</P>
        <P>The fracturing of the main rebel groups over the past year, and the apparent determination of the Government of Sudan to pursue a military solution make the search for peace even more difficult.  I and my EU colleagues welcome the appointment of Djibril Bassol&eacute; as joint <Col N="385"/>AU-UN chief mediator in June 2008, and we are hopeful that his committed efforts to bring the two sides together will be successful, despite the disappointing lack of political will apparent on all sides.</P>

	<P>According to Central Statistics Office estimates, approximately 16,200 Irish emigrants returned to live in Ireland in the past year, bringing the total number of returned emigrants since 2003 to over 107,000. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the vast majority of returning emigrants do not request State assistance in making arrangements for their return.  However, some returning emigrants do require support and, in this context, my Department allocates financial support to frontline welfare organisations which assist such people.</P>
        <P>My Department has provided funding to two organisations working specifically in this area, the Safe Home Programme and the Crosscare Migrant Project.  The award of a &euro;249,900 grant in April of this year brought the Department&rsquo;s total funding for Safe Home since 2005 to over &euro;900,000.  I have also approved funding of &euro;159,000 this year to support the Crosscare Migrant Project, bringing the total Emigrant Support funding awarded to the organisation since 2005 to &euro;475,000.  This substantial funding is testament to the high value which the Government places on their work.  The Government remains committed to supporting frontline welfare agencies and organisations.</P>

	<P>I had a meeting on 6 October with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of the European Parliament which provided a useful opportunity to hear first-hand the concerns of MEPs from across the Union on issues related to the Lisbon Treaty. A number of MEPs also raised concerns about the funding of organisations seeking a No vote during our referendum campaign. I confirmed to the European Parliament Committee that the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) is responsible for issues connected with the funding of election and referendum campaigns here.</P>
        <P>I am aware also that the Conference of Presidents of political groups in the European Parliament issued a statement on 25 September about the funding of those who sought a No vote during our referendum. The statement acknowledged that SIPO is the appropriate body to address these matters.</P>
        <P>There are those across Europe who have always opposed the development of the European Union and, in our democratic societies, they have every right to argue their case. The risk for Ireland is that anything that makes it more difficult for us to retain our place at the heart of the Union is likely to be detrimental to our economic prospects. Such positions are diametrically opposed to Ireland&rsquo;s interests within the EU.</P>
        <P>The Irish people have consistently shown themselves to favour full Irish engagement in the European Union. The findings of the recent research on the referendum confirms this in that, by a factor of three to one, people believe that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are best pursued by remaining fully involved in the EU rather than by opting to be less involved.</P>
        <P>The study also pointed to the importance of improved communications in promoting enhanced knowledge and awareness of EU affairs. Lack of information about the Union makes it easier for opponents to spread half-truths and outright distortions about the Union&rsquo;s policies and intentions. The study also pointed to the importance of improved communications in promoting enhanced knowledge and awareness of EU affairs. Lack of information about the Union makes it easier for opponents to spread half-truths and outright distortions about the Union&rsquo;s policies and intentions. We are now looking at ways in which we can improve the manner in which European issues are communicated. We plan to work closely with the European Commission in this regard.</P>
        <P>So called Euro-sceptic ideas, which have long existed in other countries, have not traditionally been part of our European debate and have nothing to offer us today as we seek, against a backdrop of great international economic turbulence, to preserve and build upon the great gains we have made as a member of the Union during the past 35 years.</P>

Most recently, last week, on 1 October, I accompanied the Taoiseach as he travelled to Paris to discuss the matter with the President of the European Council, Nicolas Sarkozy.

	<P>I would like to assure the Deputy that it is of particular importance to me that Irish tax payers&rsquo; money benefits the poorest and most vulnerable people of the countries in which we operate.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid funding is protected by rigorous monitoring, accounting and audit controls which are in place in all countries where we provide development assistance and such controls and systems mean that funding is directed to those areas most in need. In our Programme Countries, Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) are developed in consultation with the national government and in support of their poverty reduction strategy. These papers outline the programmes and projects that Irish Aid will support over a three to five year period. The strategies have a monitoring framework with indicators and targets to measure improvements in basic services.</P>
        <P>In addition, Irish Aid is actively engaged with Governments and other donors in national policy and budget allocation discussions. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that funding for basic services and poverty reduction programmes are protected or increased. A number of Programme Countries are introducing special social protection programmes to target those who are chronically poor.</P>
        <P>Monitoring of programmes and projects is carried out by national Auditors General, donors and civil society groups on an annual basis. Particular attention is paid to progress in relation to reducing the number of people living below the poverty line and increasing access to basic health, education and water and sanitation.</P>
        <P>I am aware that poor governance is a problem in many developing countries and there are concerns regarding corruption. This is a symptom of the level of underdevelopment that exists. We are working with other donors to help strengthen public financial management systems and the institutions of governance, such as the Offices of the Auditor General.</P>
        <P>In addition, there are regular audits carried out by independent audit firms whilst Irish Aid has also its own Evaluation and Audit Unit which monitors the assistance provided.</P>
        <P>The results of the work of Irish Aid and other partners are clear on the ground. The incidence of extreme poverty is dropping in a number of Programme Countries. Economic growth in Africa is the highest in a generation. More children are at school than ever before. The context remains challenging, but progress is being made, and Ireland is playing its part.</P>

	<P>The Government has strongly supported initiatives to ease or cancel the debt burden on developing countries. Importantly, Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance to the developing world is exclusively in the form of grants rather than loans.</P>
        <P>There are two main international instruments which address the problem of the debt burden in the developing world, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. The MDRI was agreed by the G8 Countries at Gleneagles in July 2005 with a focus on debt cancellation. It came into effect on 1 July 2006, and provides for 100% relief on eligible debt from the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund for many of the poorest countries in the world, most of them in Africa. The aim is to relieve these countries from the burden of servicing debt and assist them in making progress on the UN Millennium Development Goals, with the overall objective of halving global poverty by 2015. In 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank agreed to provide similar debt relief   to the five poorest countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.</P>
        <P>To date, 25 countries have benefited from debt relief under the MDRI, at a cost of some $43.5 billion. Ireland&rsquo;s share of the total cost of debt relief provided by the World Bank under the MDRI is &euro;58.64 million. The Government contributed this amount in full in 2006.</P>
        <P>The HIPC Initiative is implemented by the World Bank and the IMF. It was launched in 1996 in order to reduce the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels but does not involve cancellation of debt. Progress on the implementation of the initiative has been relatively slow. However, t o date US$68 billion in debt-service relief has been approved under the initiative for 33 countries, 27 of which are in Africa. Ireland has contributed &euro;20 million towards the cost of implementing this initiative.</P>

        <Quest> the extent to which he and his EU or UN colleagues are in discussion in regard to the most sensitive areas in Africa affected by hunger, war and instability; the degree to which a particular plan is being pursued in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The reduction of hunger, war and instability in Africa is one of the most important tasks of the international community in the 21st century, and continues to be a priority for both the European Union and the United Nations. In our dialogue with partners in the EU and the UN, Ireland is a strong advocate for the developing world and for international peace and security.</P>
        <P>Conflict has many causes and many manifestations, but poverty and inequality have proved to be the most fertile breeding grounds for violence and instability. Most armed conflicts occur in poor countries, and the causes and effect of conflict are exacerbated by poverty and corruption. The risk of corruption, strife and famine is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, and Ireland&rsquo;s development co-operation programme focuses on all of <Col N="389"/>these risks. Irish Aid supports specific actions designed to promote political stability, including by strengthening government systems and combating inequality. Irish Aid has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.</P>
        <P>The Government established a Hunger Task Force in 2007, with the aim of identifying the particular contribution that Ireland could make to tackle the root causes of food insecurity, particularly in Africa. The Report of the Hunger Task Force, which was presented at the UN in New York in September 2008, highlighted the continued threat posed by hunger, and made several very concrete recommendations on how this threat can be dealt with.</P>
        <P>Promoting stability and supporting progress towards peace in Africa requires a huge international effort. UN-authorised peacekeeping missions have a major role in stabilising former and current conflict zones throughout Africa, not least the current EU-led military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR Tchad/RCA, in which the Irish contingent is playing a prominent role. Ireland has a strong tradition of contributing to UN-mandated peace-support missions in Africa. We have also provided support to the UN&rsquo;s Peace Building Fund and have been strongly supportive of the establishment of the Peace Building Commission.</P>
        <P>African leadership and responsibility are crucial in addressing the issues of hunger, war and instability, and the African Union represents an important strategic partner for the European Union. Since 2004, the EU has supported the development of African-led peacekeeping in Darfur and elsewhere through its African Peace Facility. Peace, security, good governance and development were among the themes discussed by European and African leaders at the EU-Africa Summit in December 2007, which agreed a comprehensive EU-Africa Strategy to address these and other common challenges.</P>
        <P>The challenges facing Africa are enormous. But there is some encouraging news. Many African economies are growing. The work of the International Criminal Court, which Ireland strongly supports, marks a real effort to end impunity for war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. While there are exceptions, notably Somalia, Zimbabwe, and Darfur, many African countries now have less violence and civil strife than has been the case for many years. There is relative peace in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola, northern Uganda and southern Sudan, although international engagement will be needed for some time. Through our aid programme, Ireland will continue to address issues of poverty, conflict and instability, and to make a real and lasting difference in the lives of many.</P>

	<P>The Battlegroup concept is designed to provide the European Union with the capacity to respond rapidly to emerging crisis situations, within the overall context of the European Union&rsquo;s security and defence policy.</P>
        <P>Battlegroups are designed to participate in time-limited missions of 30 days, extendable to a maximum of 120 days, by which time the operation would have concluded, or the Battlegroup been replaced by a larger force. Developments in relation to Battlegroups are reviewed regularly within the European Union.</P><Col N="390"/>
        <P>The purpose of the EU Battlegroups is to undertake operations (commonly referred to as the Petersberg Tasks which are set out in the Amsterdam Treaty) such as rescue tasks, tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking, in addition to peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks. Battlegroups would probably be deployed on operations at the higher end of the Petersburg spectrum. Battlegroups have been on stand-by on a rotational basis since January 2007, but to date none has been called to deploy.</P>
        <P>Ireland provided a contingent of 100 members of the Defence Forces to the Nordic Battlegroup which was on stand-by for the first half of 2008. The contingent comprised specialists in Explosive Ordnance and Improvised Explosive Device disposal, together with a protection detail. Ireland also had a number of posts in both the Force and Operational Headquarters. Sweden, as Framework nation, together with Norway, Finland, and Estonia also participated.</P>
        <P>With regard to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in future Battlegroups, we are committed in principle, subject to Government decision, to participation once again in the Nordic Battlegroup, which will be on stand-by for the first six months of 2011. The same five countries will participate, with Sweden again acting as Framework Nation.</P>
        <P>Informal discussions have also taken place between staff in the Department of Defence and representatives from Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Croatia and FYROM regarding Ireland&rsquo;s possible participation in the proposed Austrian/German Battlegroup. This Battlegroup will be on stand-by for the second six months of 2012.</P>
        <P>It should be stressed that any deployment of the Battlegroup would require a unanimous decision of the Council of the European Union. Furthermore, deployment of an Irish contingent in a Battlegroup context would be subject to the requirements of the &lsquo;triple-lock&rsquo; of Government decision, D&aacute;il approval, and UN authorisation.</P>

	<P>Ireland has a network of 75 resident diplomatic and consular Missions abroad, as well as the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Secretariat in Belfast and the North-South Ministerial Council Joint Secretariat in Armagh. While the opening of new Embassies abroad is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis, any expansion of our diplomatic network can, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, only be undertaken having regard to clear priorities and available resources.</P>
        <P>The most recent Embassy to be established was in Malawi in October 2007. The Government decided to establish an Embassy there, after the White Paper on Irish Aid, published in September 2006, designated Malawi as Ireland&rsquo;s ninth programme country.</P>
        <P>The successful trade mission, led by the former Taoiseach in January 2007, to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates underlined the potential value to Ireland of having a second resident Embassy in the Gulf region. Accordingly, and in order to take advantage of this potential, the Government in March 2007 agreed that an Embassy be established in the United Arab Emirates. The timing of the establishment of this new Embassy in Abu Dhabi is under consideration. However, this decision must take account of the wider budgetary context, in particular the availability of the necessary resources.</P><Col N="391"/>
        <P>Apart from the United Arab Emirates, there are no plans at present to establish any other new Embassies or Consulates abroad.</P>

	<P>Recent data released by the United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) demonstrate that the global HIV prevalence &mdash; the number of people living with HIV &mdash; has levelled off and that the number of new infections has fallen. This is primarily due to much improved surveillance methodologies, along with some positive impacts of HIV programmes.</P>
        <P>However, in 2007 over 33 million people were still living with HIV. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the region most severely affected in the world and is home to over 22 million people living with HIV or 68 per cent of the global total. AIDS remains the primary cause of death in Africa.</P>
        <P>Ireland has emphasised that the fight against HIV and AIDS is fundamental to poverty and vulnerability reduction. We spend over &euro;100 million annually on combating HIV and other diseases of poverty. Our assistance is targeted at those countries most affected by the pandemic including Lesotho, Zambia, Malawi, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Uganda.</P>
        <P>The Government is investing in programmes that are benefiting those most in need, delivering anti-retroviral treatment in countries most affected and providing support to children made vulnerable by AIDS. We also invest in empowering women and girls to protect themselves from infection.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made in a number of countries in reducing the prevalence of HIV and AIDS. For example, Uganda has succeeded in reducing the rates of infection from 18.3% in 1992 to 6.4% today. Ireland has played its part in this improvement.</P>
        <P>There is now better access to anti retroviral treatment for those infected with AIDS. In partnership with the Clinton Foundation, Ireland has increased its funding to the Governments of Mozambique and Lesotho to improve the accessibility of HIV treatment in rural areas and in particular to women and children. As a result of our work in Mozambique, over 78,000 people are now on HIV treatment, up from less than 2,000 people at the end of 2002. In Lesotho, following one year of operation, 4 health facilities have been refurbished and over 2,500 people are accessing HIV treatment including 100 children.</P>
        <P>This week Ireland co-hosted with UNICEF the fourth Global Partners&rsquo; Forum on Children affected by HIV and AIDS which was addressed by the Taoiseach and myself. It successfully identified consensus around the main strategies that need to be employed to improve the lives of children affected by HIV and to reduce the vulnerability of children to HIV.</P>
        <P>We are committed to continuing our work to address HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases and to ensuring that men, women and children get access to quality health and HIV services.</P>

        <Quest> the political situation in the south-western Balkans; the extent to which it is expected to achieve political equilibrium <Col N="392"/>and stability in the region within the next five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The December 2007 European Council reaffirmed that the future of the Western Balkans lies within the European Union. The countries within that region (Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) continue to feature on the agenda of the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</P>
        <P>The European Union&rsquo;s Stabilisation and Association process for South-East Europe aims to bring the countries of the region closer to EU standards and principles. The process involves the negotiation of Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs) with each of the countries. SAAs focus mainly on trade liberalisation in goods and other economic and trade-related issues, political dialogue, legal approximation, and cooperation in sectors such as industry, environment and energy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Stabilisation and Association Agreements have now been signed with all of the countries in the region with the exception of Kosovo. The Agreements with Croatia, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are already in effect. Interim Agreements dealing with economic and trade related matters &mdash; essentially matters which fall within the exclusive competence of the European Community &mdash; are in force with Albania, Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina, pending the ratification of the main agreements and their entry into force. The SAA with Serbia was signed on 29 April 2008. An Interim Agreement dealing with economic and trade matters was signed at the same time. The Council welcomed the signature of the SAA and the Interim Agreement as an important step on Serbia&rsquo;s path towards the EU. The Council decided that the ratification process of the SAA by Member States and implementation of the Interim Agreement would begin as soon as the Council decided unanimously that Serbia was cooperating fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In this context, the arrest in Belgrade on 11 June of Stojan Zupljanin, one of the four remaining war crime fugitives charged with crimes committed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, marked a welcome and significant step towards fulfilling the condition of full cooperation with ICTY.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I congratulated President Tadic and the Serbian security forces on the successful arrest on 21 July of the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was indicted in July 1995 by ICTY on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. I would urge the Government of Serbia to build on this success and continue its efforts to finalise full cooperation with ICTY, and hope that the SAA will be ratified as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Negotiations on an SAA with Bosnia-Herzegovina concluded late last year. Signature of the agreement was linked to key reform priorities being advanced. In the light of progress made by Bosnia-Herzegovina in its reform programme, the SAA was signed in Luxembourg on 16 June 2008.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Stabilisation and Association Process, the European Union opened negotiations on accession with Croatia in 2005. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has obtained candidate status, although its negotiations on accession have not yet commenced.</P>
        <P>Recent developments in the Western Balkans have largely focused on Kosovo and the decision of the Kosovo Assembly to declare independence on 17 February 2008. At the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 February, EU Foreign Ministers agreed a common response to Kosovo&rsquo;s declaration of independence, noting the uniqueness of Kosovo&rsquo;s situation, arising from the conflict of the 1990s and the eight years of UN administration which <Col N="393"/>followed, and reaffirming the EU&rsquo;s willingness to play a leading role in strengthening stability in the region including by means of the planned ESDP rule of law mission, EULEX KOSOVO.</P>
        <P>The Council also agreed that Member States would decide, in accordance with national practice and international law, on their relations with Kosovo. Since then, 21 EU Member States, including Ireland, have recognised Kosovo&rsquo;s independence.</P>
        <P>With the coming into force of the new Kosovo constitution on 15 June, the focus for the EU is to ensure a smooth transition from the current UN mission (UNMIK) to the EU&rsquo;s EULEX KOSOVO mission, and to ensure that the international presence can operate effectively throughout Kosovo, including Serb majority areas in the North. The EU is working closely with the UN to achieve this.</P>

	<P>There is no delay in processing the majority of Child Benefit applications.  Awards on behalf of Irish-born children are processed either automatically or in a partially automated way using the child&rsquo;s birth details when they are registered with the General Registrar&rsquo;s Office.  Parents are contacted by the Child Benefit office within two days of the registration of their child&rsquo;s birth.  The Early Childcare Supplement is paid automatically when Child Benefit is awarded. </P>
        <P>Currently there are delays in processing Child Benefit for children born outside Ireland who have come to live in Ireland with their parents or who reside in another EU member state but have an entitlement to Irish Child Benefit under EU regulations.</P><Col N="397"/>
        <P>In the case of non Irish born children resident in Ireland, the process is slow as the customer must satisfy the Habitual Residency condition test and this may entail contacting employers, Department of Justice and other relevant bodies to confirm their status in the state.  The residency of the children in Ireland must also be confirmed.  This additional complexity, combined with an increase in the volume of applications received in recent years, has led to arrears of claims to be processed.  Additional staff resources have been assigned to this area and it is envisaged that all arrears on hand will be cleared during the first half of 2009.</P>
        <P>EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country may have an entitlement to Family Benefits in Ireland under EU Regulation 1408/71.  Before payment of Child Benefit is made for non-resident children, it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable in the home country as this will determine entitlement to Irish payments.  This process can take a number of months to complete in normal circumstances.</P>
        <P>The number of claims received from EU nationals for non-resident children is down approximately 50% on the same period last year.  Applications currently being received are being processed within normal timeframes.  The arrears of claims on hand are being processed by additional temporary staff recruited for this purpose and it is anticipated that these applications will all be finalised by mid 2009.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the Health Service Executive (HSE), as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. </P>
        <P>Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.</P>
        <P>Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels.  This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.</P>
        <P>A review of rent limits was undertaken earlier this year.  The review was informed by analysis of data sourced from the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the Community Welfare Service and by the views of statutory and voluntary agencies working in this area.</P>
        <P>Data provided by the CSO indicates that the increase in private rent levels began to decelerate at the beginning of 2008 and rent levels declined by almost 5% by August of this year.  This deceleration in rent levels is also reflected in the <i>Daft.ie</i> rental reports where a decrease of over 5% was reported in the first half of 2008 and this included Dublin city.  It is also reported that the supply of available rental accommodation has more than doubled in the last year.</P><Col N="398"/>
        <P>Given the current downward trend in private rent levels and the fact that the overall housing market is currently in a period of adjustment, increasing rent limits in the rent supplement scheme would send an inappropriate signal to the market where a third or so of private sector tenants receive rent supplement.  There is currently no hard evidence that the prescribed upper limits on rent levels supported under the rent supplement scheme are having a detrimental impact on the ability of eligible tenants generally to secure suitable rented accommodation to meet their needs.</P>
        <P>Rent levels will continue to be monitored particularly for households that may find it difficult to secure or retain accommodation within the limits in certain areas.  The position will be reviewed in January 2009 at which stage the results of the latest Private Rented Index report published by the CSO will be analysed for impact on rent limits.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has flexibility to award rent supplement above or below rent limits, having regard to local rent levels or to meet the particular needs of an individual.  These discretionary powers ensure that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  A mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. </P>
        <P>Mortgage interest supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  Many recipients pay more than &euro;13 because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that<?oasys _jy ?>they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation<?oasys _jy ?>costs.</P>
        <P>The first &euro;75 of additional income, that is, income above the standard rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to a person&rsquo;s circumstances, is disregarded for mortgage interest supplement purposes, with any additional income above &euro;75 assessed at 75%.  This measure ensures that people have a financial incentive to take up education or training opportunities or return to employment.</P>
        <P>The Executive has advised that the person concerned had been awarded a mortgage interest supplement of &euro;466.20 per month from 1 August 2008.  She has since been awarded family income supplement of &euro;150 per week from 1 October 2008.  When this additional income is <Col N="400"/>taken into account the revised rate of mortgage interest supplement payable is &euro;194.07 per month from 1 October 2008.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for a range of Social Welfare payments, including Child Benefit, applicants are required to satisfy the Habitual Residence condition (HRC), which was introduced on 1 May 2004. </P>
        <P>The HRC requires the applicant to satisfy the deciding officer that they meet certain conditions, including that their centre of interest is in Ireland and that their future intentions, as demonstrated, are to remain in Ireland.  The legal right to undertake employment and be self supporting are considered by the deciding officer when the person&rsquo;s centre of interest and future intentions are being examined.</P>
        <P>In order for Romanian nationals to work in Ireland, they are required to have a work permit; neither the person referred to nor her partner appear to have such a permit.  Both appear to have been in Ireland prior to Romania&rsquo;s accession to the EU in January 2007 but did not register with the Dept of Justice or have work permits for this period.</P>
        <P>The Child Benefit application was refused on 14 September 2007 as the Deciding Officer, having considered all the circumstances, did not consider that the person concerned satisfied the HR condition as her centre of interest and future intentions have not been clearly established due to her inability to work legally in Ireland, or alternatively to support herself independently.  The person concerned was notified of the decision in writing on 14 September 2007 and given the right of appeal.</P>
        <P>A further Child Benefit application was received from the person concerned on 5 August 2008, and this has also been refused as the Deciding Officer does not consider that she satisfies the Habitual Residence Condition.  The person concerned was notified of the decision in writing on 7 October 2008 and of her right of appeal.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 190 together.</P>
        <P>The revised suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability introduced in November 2007 provide a more targeted and integrated response to the housing needs of older people and people with a disability.  To announce the launch of the revised suite of grant schemes, my Department placed notices in the national press and on the Department&rsquo;s website, while the local authorities notified the public of the launch of the schemes at local level.</P>
        <P>Information on each of the grant schemes, including a brief explanation of the types of works allowable and the applicable means-tests, can still be obtained at my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>, or from local authority offices.</P>
        <P>Local authorities prioritise applications under the Housing Aid for Older People (HAOP) scheme on the basis of the medical needs of the applicant and on the urgency and necessity of <Col N="402"/>the identified works.  Special consideration is given to applicants in hospital who require works to be completed in order to facilitate the continuance of their care in their own home, or to facilitate their direct return home.  The administration of the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability, including the prioritisation, processing and approval of individual applications, is a matter for individual local authorities and one in which my Department has no direct function.</P>
        <P>The high level of publicity surrounding the revised grant schemes since their launch has led to an increased level of activity being experienced by local authorities this year.  In response to the particularly high levels of activity under the revised schemes experienced in 2008 by certain local authorities, my Department recently made supplementary Exchequer allocations totalling &euro;3.6 million towards the operation of these schemes this year.  The issue of a further round of supplementary allocations to other local authorities will be considered in the event of further funding becoming available.  My Department has re-emphasised to local authorities the importance of prioritisation in assessing grant applications given the level of demand being experienced nationally.</P>

	<P>My responsibilities under the Wildlife Acts relate to the conservation of populations of certain protected species including all deer species. </P>
        <P>Deer may only be hunted under licence.  The open season for most deer species, including Red, Fallow and Sika, operates annually from 1 September to 28 February, depending on the gender and age of deer.  However there is a 12-month open season for Muntjac Deer.</P>
        <P>Applications for licences to shoot deer under Section 29(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, are considered by my Department from 1 August for the following open season.  Information on the numbers of deer killed in the previous season is gathered at this stage. It is estimated that 23,699 deer were killed in the State in the 2007/2008 season, of which 10,282 deer were killed in County Wicklow.</P>

	<P>The WTO Ministerial meeting convened in July last in Geneva ended without agreement on agriculture and NAMA modalities despite emerging convergence on a range of headline numbers and detailed technical issues.  The sticking point was irreconcilable differences between US, India and China on the extent of remedies that developing countries would be allowed to apply to counter import surges in agricultural products that might arise following the import tariff cuts proposed.  However, a range of other issues had not at that stage been addressed and no formal agreement had been reached in agriculture on the points under discussion.</P>
        <P>In closing the Ministerial conference, DG Lamy and other participants spoke of the need to preserve the progress achieved, notwithstanding the failure to agree on all matters.  However the process for moving the negotiations forward from this point is far from clear.  Discussions are continuing at official level with meetings among the so-called G7 group of countries (EU, US, Brazil, India, Japan, Australia and China).  However, the constraints of the forthcoming US and Indian elections and the appointment of a new Commission are expected to delay serious political decision-making for the foreseeable future.  While it cannot be ruled out that attempts will be made to bank the convergence already achieved, the negotiations are conducted according to the premise that &ldquo;nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>As one of the most open economies in the world, Ireland wanted a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced trade deal.  This remains the case.  We were strongly committed to supporting trade in the least developed countries and have already given them duty and quota free access to EU markets under the &ldquo;everything but arms&rdquo; measure.  This also remains the case.</P>
        <P>In the negotiations we firmly defended our agriculture interests and also sought the best advantage for our industry and services; the other 150+ countries equally had their ambitions.</P>
        <P>I and my colleagues in Government, up to and including the Taoiseach, took every opportunity to outline Ireland&rsquo;s dissatisfaction at the direction of the negotiations and the serious difficulties that could emerge for Irish agriculture from some of the proposals on the table.  We used our position in the negotiations to influence matters and to mitigate the more damaging aspects of the proposals.</P>
        <P>The fact that no deal was agreed on this occasion does not cause any immediate disruption in the international trading environment.  It simply means that we continue with the current international WTO arrangements.  In that respect, we must continue to focus strongly on ensuring that we produce high quality and innovative food products for our valuable export markets in the EU and in other parts of the world.  Competitiveness, quality and innovation will continue <Col N="404"/>to be the key elements in our agri-food export success, irrespective of any changes in the regulatory trading environment.</P>

	<P>I attended the recent Agriculture and Fisheries Council of Ministers Meeting in Brussels on the 29 September 2008.  The main item of interest to Ireland at this Council Meeting was a discussion on a proposal for cod recovery in Community waters.  This proposal is one of key importance to Ireland and would involve the introduction of a strict days at sea limitations for fishing vessels operating off the south and west coast of Ireland.  I strongly argued that restrictive days at sea were not necessary for the Celtic Sea south and west coast fisheries.  I stressed that alternative measures such as closed areas to protect spawning stock could be just as effective.  This matter is critical for the Irish whitefish fleet generally and I will be working closely with the Federation of Irish Fishermen over the coming weeks to develop the best possible solution for our fishing industry in the context of the tough measures being proposed by the EU Commission.</P>
        <P>An informal discussion to mark the start of the debate on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy was held with Fisheries Ministers on the margins of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council.  The Common Fisheries Policy was formally established in 1983, and has since then been subject to revision every ten years.  The latest Reform was agreed in 2002, and is up for review in 2012 at the latest.</P>
        <P>Our aim is for a Common Fisheries Policy which results in a strong, sustainable and profitable seafood industry and, most importantly, which provides economic activity for our coastal communities, as set down for Ireland in the Cawley Strategy &mdash; Steering A New Course.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that there is some pressure at this early stage in the debate for a change in the policy that would promote an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) regime at European level.  l will not support such a policy which promotes the concentration of activity and benefits in the hands of a small number of large companies.  Our aim is for a policy which maximises the development of all our coastal communities and for this reason it is vital that quotas and their management are retained under national competence and not moved to a market based mechanism.</P>
        <P>This debate on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is at a very early stage.  The Commission will bring forward a Green Paper for discussion next year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government decision on the decentralisation of my Department is that some 600 headquarters staff will move to Portlaoise, the local offices in Cork city will move to Fermoy, involving some 100 staff; and the laboratories in Cork and Limerick will move to Macroom, involving up to 100 staff. <Col N="406"/> The move of the Fisheries function of my Department to Clonakilty, involving over 80 staff, is now substantially complete.  The decision regarding state agencies is that Bord Bia will move to Enniscorthy and Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) will move to Clonakilty. </P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s original Decentralisation Implementation Plan allowed for a phased movement to Portlaoise.  The 2005, 2006 and 2007 advance phases of decentralisation to Portlaoise were completed on schedule.  There has been an increase of some 300 full-time posts to bring the total number in Portlaoise to almost 500 since the programme began.  To date, the Department has met its targets as set out in its original plan.  The initial estimate for completion of the plan was 2008, to coincide with the availability of the permanent accommodation.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) announced last December that a consortium, the Macquarie Partnership, has won the tender for the project to build the permanent offices in Portlaoise (as part of a public private partnership including offices in Mullingar and Carlow) and planning permission for the new building has now been granted.  A revision to the Department&rsquo;s Decentralisation Implementation Plan is now being considered, to reflect the changes to the timetable and the progress so far, as well as the evolving operating environment.  An additional advance phase has been agreed and planning and preparations for this phase are currently underway.</P>
        <P>Separate implementation plans for Fermoy and Macroom are in place.  The plans allow for a phasing of the recruitment of staff but no physical move until the permanent accommodation is in place.  Bord Bia and BIM also have separate implementation plans; no advance moves have taken place.</P>
        <P>In total there has been an increase of 297 full-time posts in Portlaoise and 84 in Clonakilty since the programme was announced.  Of the 297 who transferred to Portlaoise, 204 were relocated from Dublin; of the 84 who transferred to Clonakilty, 35 were relocated from Dublin.</P>
        <P>The acquisition of property is primarily a matter for OPW and they have supplied the following details of the site acquisition at the Department&rsquo;s four locations.</P>

        <P>However, as the Deputy will be aware, I announced a review of the procedures for recognising primary schools on 14 September last.  In the interim period, it is not planned to recognise any new primary schools except in areas where increases in pupil numbers that cannot be catered for in existing schools require the provision of new schools.  This means that new schools will not be established for reasons not related to demographic growth in areas where there is already sufficient school accommodation or where the increases can be catered for by extending the existing school accommodation.</P>

	<P>All applications for capital funding are assessed against published prioritisation criteria to determine the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity etc. leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  Projects are then selected for inclusion in the School Building and Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  </P>
        <P>Currently, there are 105 projects in architectural planning which have a band rating of 1.1.</P>

	<P>The two Devolved Schemes, the Small Schools Scheme and the Permanent Accommodation Scheme, were originally introduced on a pilot basis for 38 schools in 2003.  Due to the positive feedback from schools, they were extended to cover 699 more schools between the years of 2004 and 2007.  The purpose of these devolved schemes are to devolve funding to individual school authorities to undertake refurbishment of existing buildings and/or smaller extensions which will address the school&rsquo;s long term accommodation needs. </P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Schemes, school authorities are empowered to manage these works with detailed guidance from, and minimal interaction with, the Department.  Devolving funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money. Nevertheless, schools are required to meet all design, consultancy and procurement procedures as laid out in my Departments guidelines.</P>
        <P>The two schemes are still in operation with total expenditure under both schemes reaching &euro;220 m to date.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The school to which the Deputy refers to has an application for a new school on a new site with the Department.  A suitable site has been identified for the school in question.  The site comprises three plots of land with three separate vendors.  Officials from my Department are in contact with key stakeholders with a view to exploring the options open to advancing the proposed acquisition.</P>
        <P>The progression of this project will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to my Department for school buildings generally.  In light of the many competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the acquisition of the site at this time followed by progression of the project.</P>
        <P>In the meantime temporary accommodation for the school has been approved by my Department as an interim measure to facilitate increased enrolments for Sept 2008.</P>
