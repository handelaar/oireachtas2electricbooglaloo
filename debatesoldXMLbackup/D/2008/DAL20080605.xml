    <Title>Request to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice under Standing Order 32.  I call on Deputy Seymour Crawford to state the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to debate the following urgent matter, namely, the failure of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Health Service Executive to provide an interim measure to deal with the crisis that is preventing the subvention office paying the necessary funds to those who cannot afford private nursing home charges but are forced to avail of these facilities because of the lack of public beds.  I am aware of an individual who has been asked to pay &euro;1,117.24 for the month of May, which he cannot afford.  Another man has two sisters in a nursing home, one with multiple sclerosis and the other with cerebral palsy, and cannot afford these types of costs.  There is an urgent need for a debate on this issue and an examination of how the &euro;110 million set aside for the fair deal programme has been spent.  This House cannot retire for a long summer break while leaving elderly and disabled persons and their families in the lurch.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Having given the matter full consideration, I do not consider it to be in order under Standing Order 32.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. <i>a</i>9, motion re membership of committees; No. 9, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a Council decision on the improvement of co-operation between the special intervention units of the member states of the European Union in crisis situations; No. 10, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a proposal for a Council framework decision on taking account of convictions in the member states of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings; No. 11, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a draft Council decision on the stepping up of cross-border co-operation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime; No. 12, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a proposal for a Council framework decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters; No. 13, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the terms of the agreement establishing a maritime analysis and operations centre &mdash; narcotics between Ireland, the <Col N="440"/>Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Spain, the Italian Republic, the Portuguese Republic, the French Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; and No. 13<i>a</i>, motion re extension of report back date by joint committee.</P>
        <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. <i>a</i>9, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 13a shall be decided without debate; that questions to the Minister for Health and Children shall be taken after Private Members&rsquo; business for 75 minutes and in the event of a Private Notice Question being allowed, it shall be taken after 45 minutes, and the order shall not resume thereafter; and that the D&aacute;il on its rising today shall adjourn until Tuesday, 17 June 2008.  Private Members&rsquo; business shall be No. 46, motion re allocation of carbon allowances, resumed, to be taken after No. 13<i>a</i> and to conclude after 90 minutes, if not previously concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three proposals to put to the House.  Is the proposal to deal with Nos. <i>a</i>9, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 13<i>a</i> without debate agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Where are these motions to be discussed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There were discussed yesterday at committee and are before the House for adaptation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I object to the way in which the Government is ordering the business of the House.  We have a set of five motions which were considered yesterday by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, together with a proposal to extend the deadline for the consideration of the Thornton Hall proposal.  It is often the case as we approach the end of a D&aacute;il session that multiple motions are referred to committees.  The latter are given only a short period to consider these motions, after which they are referred back to the House for approval.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems to be a serial offender in this regard.</P>
        <P>I welcome the extension of the time limit for consideration of the Thornton Hall proposal.  However, we must bear in mind that the House is effectively acting as the planning authority in respect of this project.  As Deputy Rabbitte observed yesterday, a local authority would take two months to consider a planning application for a small development.  However, the Government seeks to have it considered by the Oireachtas within a week.  I do not propose to divide the House on the issue but this is no way to order the business of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand why the removal of the motion on Thornton Hall from today&rsquo;s schedule necessitates an early conclusion of our business.  Surely there must be other business that can be addressed.  Given that there are only three further sitting weeks before the summer recess, we should have resumed our Second Stage consideration of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008 today, thereby allowing more time for the debate on the Thornton Hall motion when the D&aacute;il returns on Tuesday week.  Will the T&aacute;naiste and Chief Whip consider my proposal?  It makes more sense and would allow for greater participation in the Thornton Hall debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In order to facilitate further debate on this issue, it was decided yesterday, at the behest of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, that the deadline be extended.  There is a timeframe within which we must work and it has been agreed to debate this matter on 17 June.  This is the most appropriate way to deal with it and it was not considered appropriate to look to further business.  The best approach is to accept this proposal and thus allow for the further extension as agreed by the committee.</P><Col N="441"/>
        <P>With regard to the overall issue raised by the Deputy, the justice committee is probably one of the busiest committees in the House and it has a considerable amount of work on hand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has no chairman.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be dealt with under No. <i>a</i>9.  I believe Deputy Dinny McGinley did a great job yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Leave him there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should not respond to asides.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I knew where he was all day.  It was fantastic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in giving that one receives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware the committee is doing its utmost to evaluate all these matters in a short timeframe.  The extension of time to deal with Thornton Hall was the wish of every Member and this has now been facilitated by order of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal to deal with No. 2 agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Thornton Hall issue was to be dealt with today but that has now been deferred until after 17 June.  The proposal regarding No. 2 demonstrates that the Government has no business to replace the Thornton Hall issue after Question Time today.  Why is there no business to be dealt with today in the absence of the Thornton Hall debate?  I note that on the day the House resumes it is proposed to guillotine the debate on the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  Why is that Bill not before the House today or, indeed, any other legislation we should be dealing with?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point I made but the T&aacute;naiste did not respond to it in her earlier reply.  I was prepared to quietly let the matter drop but we have an opportunity to continue the debate on the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, given that there is time available today.  Question Time has been brought forward because there is no other business to fill the schedule so the sitting will conclude early.  Surely we could have allowed the debate on that Bill to continue today.  That is the appropriate way to do business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Thornton Hall was to be dealt with today but, to facilitate the committee, the time has been extended.  If we were to introduce new legislation today, the Opposition spokespersons would be in consternation as they would not have had adequate time to prepare for a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>They are never in consternation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Turmoil, perhaps.  To be fair to Members who wish to participate in debates, it was decided not to introduce new business this afternoon.  Members cannot have it both ways.  Perhaps we could use this opportunity to canvass for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be in a position to assist the House on the Thornton Hall issue.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="442"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael has not commented on the proposal.  I call Deputy Flanagan on the proposal to deal with health questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the proposal to deal with Thornton Hall, as mentioned by the T&aacute;naiste when she spoke of consternation, one of the reasons the issue is not being dealt with today is the fact that it was given detailed consideration all day yesterday in the justice committee.  The outcome of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not dealing with Thornton Hall but with the proposal to deal with health questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody at the committee meeting spoke against the Thornton Hall development.  The Green Party is on record as opposing it and Deputy Finian McGrath, with whom the Government has signed a sweetheart deal, is also now against it.  We are aware that Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers oppose it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not appropriate to the proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is this matter on the Order Paper?  Who supports it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe we can put it in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question before the House relates to health questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is for it?  Everybody in the committee spoke against it and that is why it is not on the Order Paper today.  Is the Government in favour of the Thornton Hall project?  All the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers are against it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must resume his seat.  Is the proposal for dealing with health questions today agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal regarding No. 3 agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not object to the D&aacute;il not sitting next week.  It is normal practice in the week of a referendum.  However, I must express concern about the time context of this adjournment.  There was a very short sitting this week.  For the life of me I do not understand why the House does not sit on the Tuesday after a bank holiday.  It is nonsense and the House should address it at the earliest opportunity.  I understand the Government plans to conclude this session at the end of the first week in July, which means there will be just nine sitting days after next week before the summer recess.  The country is going through changing economic circumstances.  Yesterday, we were informed that the Government has taken in &euro;1.2 billion less than expected in tax revenues so far this year.  Its finances appear to be way off track.  Does the Government have any plans after the House resumes sitting on 17 June&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with the proposal to adjourn until 17 June.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This is to enable me to assess the proposal.  Does the Government have any plans for the Minister for Finance to introduce a supplementary Budget Statement to the House between 17 June and the summer recess?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no plans to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal regarding No. 3 agreed?  Agreed.  I call Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="443"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>To follow up on the matter Deputy Gilmore raised, yesterday&rsquo;s figures prove beyond doubt that the people backed the wrong horse in the election last year.  The people were told by the previous Minister for Finance that they should not believe the economic reality put forward by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in our pre-election projections.  We now have the evidence of yesterday&rsquo;s tax returns to show that this country is facing very serious economic challenges, something that was pointed out repeatedly by Opposition spokespersons.  The consumer is being fleeced by diesel, petrol and home heating oil prices.  Everybody, including fishermen and business people, is confronted every day by the reality of rising prices, stagnant incomes and difficulties with mortgage repayments, and this is being ignored by the Government.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste, in reply to Deputy Gilmore, said there are no plans to discuss the financial difficulties the country faces between 17 June and 3 July.  However, we will insist on having a proper debate on a pre-budget outlook before the House rises in July.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can be in order by asking about legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I am dealing with the preparation of the Estimates and the subsequent Finance Bill.  There is no point in leaving this matter until November.  The Estimates for 2009 will be very different from those for 2008.  The T&aacute;naiste should confirm that the House will spend two or two and a half days discussing the pre-budget outlook before the House rises in July&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is requesting a debate on the economic situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;so we can hear the Government&rsquo;s proposals to deal with staying within the borrowing limit of 3% set by Europe in the Growth and Stability Pact, how it proposes to deal with public pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss it now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and how it can ensure that it will not cut back on its capital programme, as outlined by the previous Minister for Finance and Taoiseach.  I note that the Minister for Finance said yesterday that he has been left to clean up the mess that was covered up for the last number of years by his immediate predecessor.</P>
        <P>Ten years ago there was a referendum on the issue of bail in the criminal justice system.  There are currently 49 Bills relating to justice in the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.  The number of offences committed by persons out on bail has risen by 60%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question for the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is up from 15,500 in 2004 to 24,200 in 2007.  When is it proposed to do something about this in the 49 Bills on the list?  When will the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform inform the House that he will take action to deal with the serious offences being committed by persons out on bail?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the justice issues, five considerable Bills are on the A list&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What about No. 49?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that are an absolute priority and that all Members of the House would like to be enacted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of bail, at present we cannot give a definite time but the matter is being kept constantly under review by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is nonsense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of a debate, I was asked whether there was a proposal to introduce a supplementary budget to the House.  There are no plans to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>

	<P>We have nine sitting days left until the Government plans to close this House down for the summer.  We have been supplied with a draft schedule for three of those days, 17 to 19 June, inclusive, which leaves just six days free for business other than that which the Government has listed for those three days.  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate what business the Government intends to transact in the House between now and the planned rising of the D&aacute;il in early July?</P>
        <P>Arising from her earlier reply to me that the Government does not have plans to make a supplementary Budget Statement to the House before the summer, what opportunity will be taken in the D&aacute;il to introduce a comprehensive Government statement of policy on the state of the economy, which is in a completely changing set of circumstances?  This is not a matter for discussion between the Whips, I want to know what are the Government&rsquo;s intentions.  We have seen the figures in regard to the public finances.  People are losing their jobs and they are worried about their businesses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I am talking about the Order of Business between now and 4 July.  What plans does the Government have to make a statement to the House so that we can all consider how it intends to deal with the changing economic circumstances?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On that basis I resist rising to the challenge that is being put forward on the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the returns have been disappointing but income receipts are on target and we have a very resilient economy.  It is not without its challenges, many of which are not necessarily local but are of a global nature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>

	<P>If the Leaders of the Opposition and the Whips wish to facilitate a debate we will not resist it.  People are most anxious to have other legislation concluded by the end of the term, mainly on the fair deal.  An intoxicating liquor Bill was published today and people are <Col N="446"/>very anxious that those matters are equally as important and must be dealt with.  I am sure we can facilitate discussion on the economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;within the framework, but as we all know next week will be fundamental to the economy.  We are all agreed that it is appropriate for all Members of the House to take the opportunity to ensure that we remain very strong within the European Union and that we have a successful outcome on 12 June.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith agat a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It is appropriate on this special day north of the Border that we extend good wishes to the new First Minister designate and the Deputy First Minister as they embark on what hopefully will be a worthwhile and fruitful relationship at the helm of the Executive and the Assembly.  We hope that in the very short time ahead we will see the delivery of those critical elements of the promise and hope of the Good Friday Agreement delivered.</P>
        <P>On a separate matter, regarding the limited time that remains between now and the summer recess, as has been alluded to, the Government should facilitate a debate within the House to address the deepening crisis within the health service.  I speak specifically about the fact that this week we have seen the exposure of the ever-increasing number of patients waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency departments and at this time of the year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have the debate now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask if the Government will facilitate, over the period of the limited weeks ahead between now and the summer recess, an address of this crisis because if we do not address it now, what will the situation be like in the autumn and the winter period?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is well made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is absolutely essential that that is done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate that we give the best wishes of the House to the new First Minister and Deputy First Minister and wish them well.  We look forward to working with them in a collaborative way in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>On the issue of health services and reform, that is a matter that has been discussed<i> ad infinitum</i> in this House, almost every day.  If we wish to factor in debates, that can be done within the limited timeframe.  We will have to prioritise and we will facilitate that prioritisation to the best of our ability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Chief Whip please take note of that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>For the information of the House, Standing Orders require that a debate be promised before it is in order to be raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the T&aacute;naiste in hoping for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote next week.  I note her boss, the Taoiseach, and some of his colleagues were canvassing at the races in Kilbeggan last week.  I wonder if he had any insider knowledge by way of tips from the former Taoiseach as to likely runners and winners.</P><Col N="447"/>
        <P>On promised legislation, No. 14 on the pink sheet, the prison development approval confirmation Bill, which is necessary legislation to facilitate the development at Thornton Hall, is that legislation still going ahead having regard to the fact that the Green Party is on record as not supporting the legislation and Deputy Finian McGrath is now very much against it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question about the legislation is entirely in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation will be introduced following the outcome of the resolution of the House.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it Government policy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and if it was in Offaly the Deputy would probably not be giving out.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is losing control.  He has been in the job for only a few weeks but he has lost control.  They are revolting against him.  He will have to wheel them in to the boss.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise three matters.  Given that the economy is taking a downturn and the employment possibilities that would be created by a new port at Bremore, will the T&aacute;naiste advise us of the state of the harbours Bill and when it will come to the House?</P>
        <P>As a woman of compassion, I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will be concerned at the fact that many people on medical cards cannot get a dentist on the medical card scheme.  One woman from south Dublin spoke on the radio last week about&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>Decisions are made by the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the dentists Bill.  When will the Bill come to the House and will it address this worsening situation whereby dentists do not take medical card patients?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot ask about the content of the Bill.</P>

	<P>Patients with medical cards find that it is becoming impossible to get a dentist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My last question is whether there are plans to introduce legislation to regulate laser eye clinics that are springing up all over the country.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed that the harbours Bill will be introduced this year.  No date has been scheduled to bring the dentists Bill to the House.  I am not aware of any proposals to introduce legislation on the regulations outlined by Deputy Reilly, but I am sure the matter can be raised with the line Minister.</P>

	<P>I seek clarification on the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reply on Government business and legislation the Government intends to have enacted by the summer recess.  Did I understand correctly from her that it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to have the fair deal legislation and the intoxicating liquor Bill enacted by the summer recess.  Does the Government intend to have any other legislation enacted by the summer recess?  Will the T&aacute;naiste give the House an assurance that the guillotine will not be used in pushing through any of that legislation?</P>

	<P>I am reminded by some of the comments this morning that the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, intended to establish an all-party committee on gambling.  Is it still the Government&rsquo;s intention to proceed with that proposal or does it believe it has sufficient expertise on the matter on its backbenches now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of new Bills that we would like to bring to finality, but we are not quite sure that will happen as one or two of those Bills are complex and will take some time.  We also have the remaining Stages of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill and the prisons Bill.  We need to get through a considerable amount of legislation and hopefully it will be enacted by the end of the session.</P>

It relates to people with an intellectual disability who are inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals.  I received the reply to my question this morning and it makes harrowing reading.

	<P>If there is a matter of serious concern to the Members of the House and if we can get agreement to discuss it, then perhaps we can have an all-encompassing debate that would be inclusive of the issues of which the Deputy speaks.  I do not see that this would cause any predicament or problem.  However, we will need to find the appropriate time to allow that to happen.</P>

	<P>When is legislation on management companies due?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>She referred to an interdepartmental committee of Ministers dealing with management companies.  It is a major issue for tens of thousands of people who have bought units that are subject to management companies.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be introduced before the end of the session?</P>

	<P>If everybody would co-operate we might allow those Deputies waiting a long time to get in.  I ask Deputies to be brief and allow other Members to participate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised this matter before, but it is necessary to raise it again.  This week is the first ever disability and international development week.  On the ratification of the United Nations Convention on Disability, I received a reply indicating that the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would reply to me directly, but that has not happened.  If other countries proceed to ratify ahead of Ireland not only will Irish citizens with a disability not have access to the protection of the convention, but also Ireland will only be entitled to be an observer at the monitoring committee on its implementation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

	<P>In view of the more challenging economic environment facing the country, does the T&aacute;naiste intend to introduce proposals to the House under the responsibility of her Department to deal with the requirement to train and upskill 500,000 workers in the medium term?

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department.  Does she intend to bring proposals before the House to deal with that situation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No legislation is required to deal with that; I am dealing with the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact that legislation is not required does not mean we do not have to deal with the human consequences of people losing jobs and being out of skills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>There has already been some discussion on the proposals for a prison at Thornton Hall.  I want to raise the proposal to move the Central Mental Hospital to the Thornton Hall site and the widespread opposition to that from a variety of organisations.  Economist, Mr. Jim Power has made a cost-neutral proposal to leave the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum by selling off part of the site.  This would cost the State nothing.  Has the Government given any thought to that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not appropriate on the Order of Business as the Deputy well knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I knew the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would say that so I ask this in the context of the mental health Bill, which is on the long-term list.  Could the Government bring that Bill forward so we can debate this issue before it becomes a <i>fait accompli</i>?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The mental health Bill will be introduced next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  This House is acutely aware of the importance of day care centres as a lifeline for elderly people across this country.  Is the Government aware that nothing is sacrosanct or safe from the scalpel of cuts imposed by the HSE?  I ask this against the background of legislation so it will be in order.  Is the Government aware that when it takes steps to ensure a day care centre, St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital in Mullingar, which has been proposed for closure for six weeks of the summer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy asking about promised legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Those elderly people, especially those from rural areas, are being left out in the cold.  Does this Government give a fig about anybody?  Does it take control of the HSE or just push matters out to another quango that answers to nobody?</P>

	<P>I speak for the elderly people of the country and my area.  It is a disgrace.  It is time the Government takes hold of the HSE, abolishes it and brings control back to people who are responsible to this House.</P>

	<P>I will mention the legislation in a moment.  I can assure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that this is in order.  I had to scour this document for it.  My colleague, Deputy Michael Fitzpatrick, tells me such investments can be very precarious.</P>

	<P>It is listed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I can draw a conclusion on that from Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s last question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste think it is appropriate that a person on bail on a charge of murder issues threats to carry out another murder?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will resume his seat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The appropriate Bill is the crimes Bill.  Can the T&aacute;naiste respond in some way to the appalling situation whereby people on bail for serious crimes are free to go about their crimes in their local areas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>

	<P>I want to ask about two pieces of legislation.  Are there any plans to amend the drinking water regulations in light of the findings in reports by the HSE and Cavan and Monaghan county councils on phenol contamination of water in Cavan and Monaghan?  What is the situation regarding the reform of the foreshore legislation which has been promised by the Government for years?  It is needed for us to comply with the Aarhus Convention and the public participation directive, over which we are being brought to court by the European Commission.  Many decisions will be taken in the future on the development of our foreshore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated previously, there is no date for the foreshore legislation because there must be a further transfer of functions.  I am not aware of any proposals on the other matter but we can raise it with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with my Ulster colleagues, the T&aacute;naiste and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, in wishing the former First and Deputy First Ministers well on their first day off and for the future.  I would gladly hear the T&aacute;naiste saying the nursing homes fair deal Bill will be dealt with before the summer.  When will it be published?  Will there be a proper opportunity for discussion of it?  In the meantime, will interim measures be taken to deal with the crisis?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation will be published.  It has taken considerable time to draft, re-draft and bring it to finality.  We are all very anxious that it be made available as quickly as possible and that when it comes to the House we will have afforded the opportunity to discuss it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been promised.  Is there confusion in Government circles in view of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s comments yesterday that, I believe, he is not in favour of saving further lives by reducing that limit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>

        <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Simon Coveney on Wednesday, 4 June 2008:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises that electricity generating companies in Ireland will make unearned windfall gains of approximately &euro;1.6 billion, based on an average cost of carbon of &euro;25 per tonne, in the years 2008 to 2012 arising from the free allocation of carbon allowances by the Government and the requirement by the electricity regulator to include the cost of carbon in electricity pricing; and</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises that the Government to date has refused to claw back this money for the benefit of consumers, the economy or the environment;</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />&ldquo;&mdash;<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />recognises:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the Government has a long-term strategy, as set out in the Energy Policy Framework 2007-2020 and in the programme for Government, to reduce our dependence on imported and finite fossil fuel sources through delivering greater energy efficiency and increasing our use of renewable resources in the electricity, heat and transport sectors;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the actions to deliver this long-term strategy in relation to the energy sector include the delivery by SEI of a range of schemes to enable domestic, commercial and industrial consumers to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the Minister for Transport has concluded the consultation phase on a paper on a sustainable travel and transport action plan that is due for completion shortly;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the social welfare fuel allowance programmes are aimed at those on lower incomes that are most vulnerable to fuel poverty;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the ESB has put in place a new &euro;22 billion strategic framework up to 2020 that will see a major investment in renewable energy, a halving of its carbon emissions within 12 years and the achievement of zero net carbon emissions by 2035;</P><Col N="461"/>
        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the issue of windfall gains to electricity generating companies that arise as a result of the free allocation of carbon allowances under the European Union&rsquo;s emissions trading scheme is a complex one that faces all EU member states;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />that this issue is subject to ongoing examination by the Department of Finance and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />that negotiations are currently taking place at EU level which will remove the possibility of free allowances after 2012; and</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />that a one percentage point reduction in the reduced VAT rate would cost the Exchequer &euro;396 million in a full year and have little impact on prices;</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>While I cannot support this Private Members&rsquo; motion, I welcome the debate.  The issue under scrutiny relates to energy policy and economic policy, both of which are centre stage in the public sphere at present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It would not be generally known that the carbon allowance scheme which is designed to cut carbon emissions has actually created an anomalous situation whereby companies make a profit while consumers pay the price for a scheme determined at EU level.  The current arrangement, which means that the ESB and other power generators have free carbon allowances, is a temporary one but the regulator&rsquo;s requirement to ensure the carbon cost in consumer charges is not.  It has led to increases in charges for electricity and these look set to rise again.</P>
        <P>A new regime in regard to carbon allowances will come into force in 2012, that is, in four years&rsquo; time.  From 2012 new targets will apply and carbon allowances will be auctioned.  For companies that cannot, or will not, reduce carbon emissions, the costs will be sizeable.  Those costs will be passed onto the customer and unless there is a real determination to tackle carbon emissions in the meantime, that cost will be penal.</P>
        <P>We already know that a 15% increase is being sought by the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is is seeking up to 20% and petrol and diesel continue to increase in cost, so the focus on the windfall gain, even if it is short-term, is timely.  We should look long and hard at how best to utilise this funding which accumulates to &euro;1.6 billion over the four year period.  I am not impressed by the vague statement in the Government&rsquo;s amendment that &ldquo;this issue is subject to ongoing examination by the Department of Finance and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources&rdquo;.  I would prefer if the Government, instead of fobbing off the motion with this kind of cotton wool, were to look seriously and rigorously at the potential value of the windfall gain.</P>
        <P>I urge that this potential be opened up, as is proposed in this motion.  However, I do not believe that dissipating the windfall gain as proposed by Fine Gael is the way to go.  It may be a popular move to reduce the lower rate of VAT from 13.5% to 12.5 % but it is not a prudent one.  After all, there is no guarantee that consumers would see the benefits.  More importantly, such a proposed use of the fund would not deal with the two overriding concerns that should determine Government energy policy, the first of which is climate change.</P><Col N="462"/>
        <P>Power generation offers us significant opportunities as a country to meet our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> targets.  Over the past ten years the Government has failed abysmally to tackle climate change.  Far from reducing, our emissions are still rising well beyond the targets already set.  The challenge into the future, as the EU sets the bar higher and as the threat of global warming increases, will become more urgent for us all.  The EU requirement of a 20% reduction by 2020 may well rise to 30% if negotiations at global level are successful.</P>
        <P>We must all face this new reality and it is not a pretty sight.  Ireland currently is the fifth highest emitter of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> <i>per capita</i> in the world.  Over the past ten years the Government record is awful.  On energy security, we have the third highest level of oil imports in the EU at 87%.  It is very difficult to see how Ireland can meet these challenges of climate change and energy security and yet, at the same time, we have simply no choice in the matter.  We will have to do so and a sea change must occur across all sectors.</P>
        <P>In the non-trading sector the big offenders, agriculture and transport, cows and cars, happen to also be the most intractable when it comes to reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  Therefore, much rides on transforming our energy production.  The vast natural resources we enjoy of wind, wave and tide are good news for us but that full potential has yet to be fully exploited.  Also welcome is the ESB&rsquo;s &euro;22 billion strategic framework which aims to halve its carbon emissions within 12 years and achieve carbon net-zero by 2035.</P>
        <P>Infrastructural development on a major scale is required and this windfall gain should be earmarked to fast-track the development of renewables in the electricity sector.  I recommend that the windfall gain be put into a carbon fund for that specific purpose.  Such investment would mean that the move towards renewables would, at the end of the day, ease costs for the consumers but it would also mean that we, as a country, would have a better chance of meeting our EU and Kyoto targets.</P>
        <P>The other great challenge is for those changes to apply evenly and fairly.  The issue of fuel poverty is real and pressing.  This winter, there will be low income families and old age pensioners who are simply not able to keep warm because of rising energy costs.  I listened in disbelief to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources when he replied to my concerns on this issue.  In this House last week, he effectively gave a sermon about how we all had to tighten our belts and face reality.  When it comes to rising costs of energy, the Minister for Finance dismisses these concerns and calls people whingers.</P>
        <P>I remind both these Ministers that this wealthy island we all share has one of the highest levels of excessive winter mortality in Europe.  An estimated 2,800 excess deaths occur here over the winter months.  Let us remember we are talking mainly about frail, elderly people.  In Northern Ireland, which is ahead of us, a fuel poverty strategy is in place to tackle what is a scandal.  In the Republic, however, there is no fuel poverty strategy or even the promise of one.  In fact, disgracefully, only 4% of the energy budget is spent on improving low income homes.  The windfall gain could and should be used to protect those on low incomes from the steep increases that may be inevitable.  There is no argument in terms of the cost of energy but the increases must not impose an undue burden on those who are least able to afford them.</P>
        <P>We are witnessing great changes in the area of energy.  This morning, the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources heard a presentation on the east-west connector.  That is a wonderful project and I hope the Government will ensure funding is provided, although I do not think anybody expects the commitment on NDP funding to be <Col N="463"/>met.  We want that project to proceed but it is possible that people will have to pay for the connector through an extra tariff on their electricity bills.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the thinking behind this Fine Gael motion but, regrettably, the Labour Party will not be supporting it because of the second section of the motion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion and to support the Government amendment moved by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s motion is leading us in the wrong direction.  It is a short-term reaction that will do nothing to help people and the economy to face energy problems in the longer term.  These problems will not arise in five or ten years' time; they have already arisen and we need to address them today.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s motion provides neither a solution nor a long-term direction for the people.</P>
        <P>Energy policy is complex but we must keep three considerations in mind.  Our energy needs to be competitive and clean and our supplies must be secure.  We face challenges in each of these considerations.  The need for clean energy is obvious if we are to avoid tilting our planet into catastrophic runaway climate change.  The emissions trading system established by the European Union is the cornerstone of our response and hopefully will be the basis of the international response agreed in Copenhagen in 2009.  The system is far from perfect, however, and my party has consistently recommended that the allocation of carbon credits, which is the basis for trading, should be done by auction rather than free allocation.  I am glad the EU is changing its policy so that auctions will form the basis of the emissions trading scheme from 2010.  Every party in this House which supports measures to address climate change is supportive of the trading scheme and the mechanisms which have led to Fine Gael&rsquo;s motion.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael makes a number of mistakes in its argument.  It confuses the emissions trading scheme and the effect it has on electricity costs with the wider issue of energy cost rises elsewhere.  One of the main reasons for the pain being felt in the transport and home heating sectors is security of supply.  Alongside concerns for clean energy, supply issues are now dominating energy policy.  The effect is also being felt in the electricity sector as gas prices follow the trajectory of increasing oil prices.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s short-term reaction of cutting taxes is not the correct way to proceed because it misunderstands global developments in energy.  That is not only the opinion of the Government.  The chief economist of the International Energy Agency, an organisation which has historically been conservative on the issue of security of supply, has clearly stated that we face an urgent problem which requires radical change in how we use energy rather than a short-term tax reduction approach.</P>

	<P>That will not address the fundamental issue of security of supply.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s response is much wider and our amendment recognises the solutions we need to introduce.  We recognised the flaws in the emissions trading scheme and argued strongly that it should have been structured differently.  That is why we are reviewing it.  We acknowledge the issue is complex but we now have an all-island single electricity market rather than having to act on our own in the South.  The two jurisdictions on the island have an interest in and responsibility for maintaining and managing that market.  Our colleagues in the UK have also considered these issues in detail and have decided not to follow the windfall tax route.</P>

        <P>The UK decision has implications for Ireland because we acted correctly by consulting the single electricity market committee, which is responsible for regulating this complex market system, and its advice contradicted the approach taken by Fine Gael.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>He is misleading the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not in order to make an allegation that a Member is misleading the House.  The Minister without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As part of our ongoing review, we examined policies in other European countries.  As Deputy Coveney noted, Spain has introduced such a scheme but this is being challenged in the Spanish courts and by the European Commission.  We are rightly following our own legal advice in investigating our options because we recognise that complex legal issues arise.  I am proud of the work done by my Department in conjunction with the ESB over the past nine months in recognition of these realities and the market conditions.</P>
        <P>The only long-term solution to delivering competitiveness in the electricity market, which is crucial to the digital and other industries, is developing renewable energy and efficiency measures in order to reduce costs.  One of the reasons for the introduction of the emissions trading scheme is to promote renewable electricity, which does not have a carbon cost.</P>
        <P>Apparently, on the basis of the contributions of its members, Fine Gael fundamentally disagrees with the work we have done.  Certain Fine Gael Members stated that their party does not agree with the ESB&rsquo;s reform strategy.  They are entitled to their position but I am of the <Col N="466"/>view that the reform strategy is the proper response because it will allow us to work with our State agencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Who said that we do not agree with the reform strategy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell.  I will show Deputy Coveney the relevant passage later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has made an accusation.  He should read the relevant part of Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s contribution into the record now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do so.  Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The Taoiseach also said it is important point out that the revenues available to the ESB and others are factored into their capital programmes for providing alternative energy sources.  This is a point on which we fundamentally disagree with the Government.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This seems to indicate that Fine Gael disagrees with the ESB&rsquo;s reform strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we disagree with the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>If I may, I wish to finish my contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Coveney should allow the Minister to conclude.  The Deputy will have an opportunity to reply at the end of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the second occasion on which the Minister has misled the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a fundamental example of matters in respect of which we have different views.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s response is to reduce taxes.  This is similar to Senator Hilary Clinton&rsquo;s assertion that there should be a tax holiday in the US because energy prices are high.  Our response is different and is based on trying to use key measures, in respect of the ESB and in other areas, to reduce demand.  We want to put smart meters in all homes so that people can reduce the amount of electricity they use to cut the cost of their bills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Government would do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amount of money people would save would be a multiple of the 2 cent reduction that Fine Gael proposes to introduce.  The latter would not provide any assistance in the context of a long-term reduction in electricity prices.</P>
        <P>It is important and correct that the Government amendment refers to a number of key areas in the economy in respect of which changes must be made.  In that context, the sustainable transport plan is a perfect example.</P>
        <P>I must inform Deputy McManus that we are equally as aware as anyone in the House of the issue of fuel poverty in the emerging energy climate.  We are investing some &euro;158 million through the Department of Social and Family Affairs in the fuel poverty allowance scheme.  I was proud to be able to double the amount of money allocated for the warmer homes scheme this year.  The scheme in question assists people to take the correct action for the long term by allowing them to invest now in better energy efficiency for their buildings in order that they will not be obliged to use so much energy and can thereby reduce their bills.</P><Col N="467"/>
        <P>I was also proud to initiate a new home energy savings scheme.  This is the best means by which to restore the construction industry &mdash; if that is the primary goal in Fine Gael&rsquo;s motion.  It is better to do this by putting in place an innovative scheme which will allow the industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not disagree with the Government in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to engage with the hugely important task of becoming more energy efficient.  Those on the opposite side of the House may laugh at this initiative and demean it by stating that it is merely me saying that we must tighten our belts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We welcomed the scheme.  What is the Minister talking about?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the crucial response.  Deputy McManus sneered as if to say that this scheme is not a key policy development.  It is the key policy development and will be achieved by the Government supporting a number of programmes and ensuring that there will be an incentive for people to do the right thing.  That is set out in the amendment.</P>
        <P>Rather than trying to offer a short-term response to this problem by cutting tax, it is far better to begin investing now in the real solutions, namely, to reduce our use of existing energy and to develop alternative sources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are in favour of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael&rsquo;s motion does nothing to assist us in this regard.  The Government is focused on the task.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the case.  The Government is not collecting a windfall tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter and to address the motion, which is populist in nature.  It is always popular to suggest that one intends to take from the rich or big business and give to the poor.  This is laudable at one level and, in a sense, it is a no-brainer.  Unfortunately, however, the motion misses the point and in my view what is proposed represents Robin Hood economics.  The latter will not solve the weakened fiscal position which has impacted on Ireland&rsquo;s economy and on other economies throughout the world.</P>
        <P>The challenges with which the economy must deal are, for the most part, outside our control.  Rising oil and food prices and difficulties regarding the euro versus the dollar and sterling are creating strains and stresses within the economy.  As a result, our capacity to trade is being hampered and this is having an impact.  This phenomenon is not peculiar to Ireland and it has become a global issue.</P>
        <P>Ireland has an open economy and the housing and mortgage sectors here are experiencing difficulties as a result of the issues that have arisen in the sub-prime market in the United States.  The challenges faced by the housing construction sector have created a sudden slowdown in the economy.  This slowdown is set against a backdrop of a prolonged period of high growth in the sector.  Perhaps we got somewhat ahead of ourselves in this regard, particularly in the context of the number of units completed in the past two years.  However, I have no doubt that the position will right itself quickly.  The construction sector has displayed its capacity to stop building and has thereby created an opportunity for the glut in the market to be addressed.  The slowdown to which I refer has had a significant and sudden impact on employment and Exchequer returns.  The headlines in today&rsquo;s newspapers illustrate the position, particularly for anyone who was not aware of what was happening.</P><Col N="468"/>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The medium to long-term prospects for the residential housing sector are very good, particularly in the context of the projections for the next two years.  These projections are based on the fact that our economy continues to grow.  The most pessimistic economists suggest that there will be a 2% growth rate in the next number of years.  When one considers these forecasts in conjunction with figures which illustrate the increase in our population, it is clear that there will be a need for more sustainable levels of residential housing development.  The residential housing sector has been extremely important to the economy.</P>
        <P>The fundamentals of the economy are strong, with projected growth rates of 2%.  Employment in other sectors is holding up strongly.  In my opinion, the industrial and commercial sectors are performing well.  The shock to the system the economy has received &mdash; this has been exacerbated as a result of our dependence in the past couple of years on the residential housing sector &mdash; is probably being felt more acutely at present.</P>
        <P>The challenges facing the residential housing sector have been exacerbated by difficulties in the banking sector.  The initial problems relating to the banking sector emanated from the sub-prime lending market in the United States and related to the capacity of banks to package sup-prime loans and sell them on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That has nothing to do with house prices in this country rising by 50% in the past six months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Demand obviously had a great deal to do with that.  I am referring to the shock to the system experienced by the economy rather than the demand for housing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The young people of Ireland are being ripped off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The difficulties in America obviously had an impact on the financial sector here.  The banks have completely reined themselves in, perhaps unnecessarily, in the context of offering people credit.  It used to be far easier for first-time buyers to obtain credit.  However, the position has changed and this is having an effect.  The banks are seeking to take a belt-and-braces approach and the days when people could obtain 100% mortgages are gone.  In many instances, banks are only prepared to provide 80% mortgages.  This affects first-time buyers, without whom the residential property sector and the economy in general will get into trouble.  First-time buyers are the lifeblood of the building sector.</P>
        <P>Current banking policy is fuelling a boom-and-bust model.  We must address this development.  The banks have created many of the problems experienced in the past four to five years.  There was a time when one could not walk past a bank without ending up with a &euro;20,000 loan in one&rsquo;s back pocket and included with every newspaper or magazine were advertising documents offering all sorts of unsecured loans.  This type of behaviour was unhelpful.  It fed an already buoyant economy and created a sense that there was endless credit available.  The banks are now acting in an aggressive manner by not offering loans to those who are in a position to repay them and who can set them off against assets that are secure.  Unfortunately, the boom-and-bust approach is having a significant impact in this regard and we must take action in respect of it.</P>
        <P>Not all banks took the approach to which I refer and some were more prudent.  However, the behaviour of those that offered incentives such as interest-free periods, 100% mortgages and the provision of funds that were additional to those that could be obtained through such <Col N="469"/>mortgages in order to allow people to buy furnishings, landscape their properties, etc., was entirely unhelpful.  Perhaps a committee of the House might address that matter at a later stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister has clearly set out the Government&rsquo;s energy policy, speaking about security of supply, sustainability of the environment and price competitiveness.  It is important we look to such Government policy rather than adopt some soft approach in terms of taking the levy from these power generation companies and appearing to give it back to the public through some reduction in VAT.  From past experience when the high rate of VAT was reduced, the difference did not find its way back to the consumer so anything suggested in this motion, particularly by way of giving the windfall back to the consumer, would not work.</P>
        <P>The windfall to the power generating sector should have some effect and we should find some method of placing encumbrance on the windfall, although I am not sure the Robin Hood levy would necessarily be the way to go.  The Government should consider attaching conditions and consideration might be given to research and development and whether the energy generating companies are not just prepared to invest in new technologies by way of capital investment.  They must look beyond that and investment in research and development for the next wave of technologies would certainly be helpful.</P>
        <P>We must reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and get real about our dependence on coal and oil.  Everybody in this House, regardless of political persuasion, is coming around to that way of thinking.  It is not sustainable in the long term to continue in the way in which we have consumed coal and oil.  We have a duty of care to the environment and the generation of power plays an important part in that.</P>
        <P>We should consider the use of hydrogen, wind, wave and tide energy in getting a much better level of power generation.  As a result of our unique position, with currents, winds and tides surrounding this island, we should be able to harness such energy and invest to a point where we will benefit in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretConlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Margaret Conlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate this morning.  It is important when analysing the motion that we take a little time to assess our current economic position and the challenges we face.  We must also examine where we have come from, both as a country and an economy.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the rate of economic growth in Ireland has averaged 7.25% per year, leading to an unprecedented change in the Irish economic sphere.  The total number of people at work has risen by 800,000, helping to accelerate average <i>per capita</i> incomes in Ireland to above those enjoyed in many other economies.  Unemployment has decreased from 10% in 1997 to approximately 4.5% in 2007.  These are some of the vital statistics we must bear in mind.</P>
        <P>However, there have been external shifts and development which are outside our control.  The strength of the euro against both the dollar and sterling is an example, as well as international financial market difficulties such as the credit crunch and higher oil and food prices.  These global economic developments play a key role in shaping Ireland&rsquo;s economic horizon as we are highly integrated in the global economy.</P>
        <P>We benefited handsomely from being such an open economy for the past ten years but we are now bearing the brunt of a downturn in the international economic field.  Many such open economies are cyclical and there are booms, depressions and recessions.  Whereas we would all like the boom times to exist <i>ad infinitum</i>, we must realise dips can come about, and we are undergoing such a period in our economy now.  It is important there is careful management of the challenges facing us at this time.</P><Col N="470"/>
        <P>To focus on the specifics of the motion, our national energy policy is central to the country&rsquo;s future economic development.  The Government&rsquo;s policy is based on the energy policy framework and the programme for Government as agreed with our Green Party and Progressive Democrats Party partners.  These documents set out the three planks for future policy &mdash; security of supply, price competitiveness and environmental sustainability.  We must adapt and be flexible in our actions to take heed of the international developments as they change and evolve.  To ignore them would be folly.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the motion specifically mentions the issue of carbon-related windfall gains for the electricity sector.  The EU&rsquo;s emissions trading scheme is complex and affects not only Ireland but all EU member states.  It is subject to ongoing analysis by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  This will take account of the ramifications and efficacy of any national and EU plans.  We must work with all State agencies in this regard.</P>
        <P>If we move next to examine the proposal to reduce the lower rate of VAT from 13.5% to 12.5%, that will result in significant losses, approximately &euro;396 million in a full year.  Even if the reduction is passed on in full to consumers, the impact on the consumer price index will be only minimal.</P>
        <P>The Government can speak from some experience.  In 2001, we cut the VAT rate from 21% to 20% but the expected benefits for the consumer simply did not come about.  The reduction in VAT was not passed on to the consumer and a year later, the Government rolled back the reduction.</P>
        <P>Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors, including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production and refining costs.  The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflects additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty, supply disruptions and strong economic growth in countries such as China.</P>
        <P>The high price of oil indicates we need energy efficiency and alternative fuel sources.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, spoke earlier on such matters, articulating why and how we must move forward with these matters.  We must take into account the experience from other countries and learn from the consequences of their actions.  We must look at how we can cut back on our dependency on fossil fuels and we must continue to develop and encourage the use of alternative sources.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt the financial position has weakened from that envisaged at budget time.  We should not forget that our public finances are strong, our level of debt is low and our GDP growth rates have been stronger than most other European countries.  The OECD economic outlook is forecasting a GDP growth of 1.5% for Ireland, picking up to 3.75% next year.  The economy has always been resilient and I am confident these growth rates will come about and we can continue with our plans in the programme for Government.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We in government have always focused on the most vulnerable in society and our measures reflect this.  We have taken successive opportunities to make real and significant increases for those on social welfare and reduce the levels of tax paid by lower income earners.  For example, the last Government promised to clear the &euro;200 pension barrier by 2007, which it delivered on.  We are also delivering increases through social welfare to the most vulnerable people in ways such as fuel allowances.  This is being done to make a real difference in the lives of ordinary people.</P><Col N="471"/>
        <P>There are further specific energy developments that I welcome.  The ESB has put in place a new &euro;22 billion strategic framework up to 2020, which should see the halving of its carbon emissions within 12 years.  I hope it will be ahead of its schedule in achieving zero net carbon by 2035.  The Minister for Transport is due to launch his sustainable travel and transport action plan soon and I look forward to its publication.</P>
        <P>The fundamentals of our economy are sound and if we adopt a wise and prudent approach to public spending, we are well placed to rise to the challenges that face us.  I am confident the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is the right person to steer the ship through these choppy international waters.</P>

	<P>To try to wriggle out of accepting this motion on spurious grounds is absurd and I hope the public sees this.</P>
        <P>This is a simple matter of principle that relates to the State recouping that part of a generator&rsquo;s income that is attributable to the free allocation of carbon allowances.  It has nothing to do with energy policy but is about the ESB collecting money &mdash; it was supposed to pay for emissions through the emissions trading scheme, ETS, but it has free allowances allocated by the State.  The regulator has calculated that electricity is approximately 10% more expensive due to this additional charge.  It is a charge the ESB does not have to carry and we are simply suggesting that this money belongs to the taxpayer.  The ESB has been given a free allocation <Col N="472"/>of credits and we are saying money should be returned to the taxpayer.  It is outrageous that anyone could suggest this might increase the price of electricity.</P>
        <P>The ESB recently had the cheek to put us on notice of a possible further increase in electricity prices of 16%.  We are suggesting the 10% mentioned, approximately &euro;300 million, belongs to the taxpayer.  It is a question of taking it back, in these difficult times, and redistributing it back to the taxpayer.  The best way to do this is not reducing the top rate of VAT from 21% to 20% but by reducing the 13.5% rate to 12.5%.  People dependent on heat, light and fuel, including old age pensioners and those on low incomes, are affected by the 13.5% rate.  We are trying to reduce the costs affecting such people.</P>
        <P>Two nights ago I spent my time on the board of management of a secondary school doing next year&rsquo;s budget.  The heating and lighting bill is going up from around &euro;25,000 to an estimated &euro;55,000 &mdash; this is an increase of approximately &euro;30,000 in one school with around 400 pupils.  We must get real on this matter.  Of course we want to cut emissions, make changes and introduce more renewable sources of energy &mdash; we are all in favour of this &mdash; but we must bring the public with us.  The public must not be conned &mdash; it is paying for something the supplier does not have to pay for.  What is wrong with Fine Gael proposing we take back this money and return it through a reduction in indirect taxes?</P>
        <P>The Government has suggested, nonsensically, that it tried to reduce VAT by 1% previously but it did not work.  We all know the answer to this and my colleague will address it when he speaks on this issue.  If the VAT rate is reduced from 13.5% to 12.5% it is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure the reduction is passed on to the consumer.  If the Government is not prepared to do this there are people on this side of the House only too delighted to take up the challenge.  It is nonsense to suggest we should not reduce taxation because savings will not be passed on to the public.  Should VAT be left at 13.5%, although we can afford to reduce it to 12.5%?  I would love to reduce this rate to 10% and make this country more competitive.</P>
        <P>Is the Government to bury its head in the sand on the basis that all of our economic difficulties originated in George Bush land?  Does the Government somehow feel that this is a problem from the US?  Are we codding ourselves?  Young people in this country had to take out larger mortgages because the Government did nothing while the price of a three bedroom terraced house in Dublin went from &euro;420,000 to &euro;525,000 in the space of ten months.  Members of the Government sat on their side of the House and did nothing.  The real problem in this country is people are up to their necks in debt due to huge mortgages.  The knock-on effect on the competitiveness of our economy is the result of Government inaction.</P>
        <P>The Government has tried to lambaste Fine Gael in this House for tabling a motion seeking to return moneys to the taxpayer that were collected but were not due to the generator.  We feel this &euro;300 million should be redistributed.  In case people do not realise, when money is returned buoyancy is created in the tax system.  It is not necessary to give the full amount because allowances should be made for buoyancy.  The money we seek to give back is, more or less, exactly in line with the cost of reducing VAT from 13.5% to 12.5%.</P>
        <P>I am a long time in politics and this is the first time I have ever heard a Government argue that a reduction in taxes would be bad for the electorate and the economy.  This is especially strange coming from a Government that has boasted of how it reduced taxes over the past ten years.  It is absolute nonsense.  If the Government had a better way to redistribute this money I would have hoped it would table a proper amendment to the motion suggesting this alternative.  Instead we have received a diatribe suggesting that nobody but the Government cares about addressing energy security and climate change.  Why did the Government not table an amendment stating that it would prefer to reduce income tax or the top rate of VAT or use <Col N="473"/>the money for another purpose beneficial to the consumer?  The amendment tabled is just a blanket attack on Fine Gael, as if we do not care about climate change.  I take grave exception to this.  I like a proper debate and if people disagree with our viewpoint, so be it.  The Government has instead waffled and made totally inaccurate statements and I find this unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal is not unusual.  Denmark recently introduced a package of taxes on sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, fossil fuels and electricity and the revenues raised amounted to approximately 3% of GDP.  The additional taxes have been used to lower personal taxes and VAT and to provide incentives for energy efficiency.  The principle of charging a tax, taking it back and reducing direct taxes works well in Denmark but apparently this Government has difficulty with the principle of returning to people something that was wrongly taken from them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this motion.  At present our economy is in recession.  The increasing rate of consumer price inflation is due not only to the global energy situation and rising food prices, but also to the lack of action, in terms of domestic policy, on regulation, competition and public sector management.  The Government has sabotaged Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to handle tougher economic times through reckless financial management over several years.  In the past two years the Government has increased its day-to-day spending by 65% more than the level of economic growth and has made absolutely no effort to deliver value for money.  Inflation is running at 5% and our economy is haemorrhaging up to 3,000 jobs per week, yet the Government is like a rabbit trapped in the headlights &mdash; it does not know where to turn.  Its anti-inflation group has not met for the past 12 months.  It sees no need to introduce corrective strategies and has failed to respond to the demand for action or put in place any plan to deal with the issue of competitiveness within the public sector, which has been demanded by its organisation, the National Competitiveness Council.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the political will is not there to carry out the reform that is urgently needed.  According to the Mazars statement on 3 June, the credit crunch is far more broadly based and deep rooted than most people think and it will take three to five years for businesses to recover.  It is clear that the housing sector collapse is spilling over into the wider economy, yet the Government is prepared to do absolutely nothing to support the economy.</P>
        <P>We have put forward a proposal to deal with this.  Getting rid of an array of quangos would save &euro;200 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money over the next four years.  There is also the proposal before the House today.  The Government is knocking it back but has not come forward with any solution to address the recession, which is being compounded by the lack of action and direction in the Government.  The only statement the Government has made in responding to this motion is that it is the wrong direction to take, yet it is not prepared to say what it will do.  It has been said that we need to reduce the demand for energy.  There will be absolutely no difficulty in reducing demand if this Government sits on its hands as it has done for the past 12 months because we will not have an economy to demand oil, fuel or energy.  That is what is happening at present.  The Government, which has been in place for the past ten years and does not know the realities of day-to-day living in our society, does not realise the impact that the fuel crisis and the recession are having on families that are trying to cope.  The response of the Minister for Finance this week was to tell people to stop whingeing and put up with the rapid rise in prices.</P>
        <P>What we have done is put forward a sensible, straightforward proposal.  A total of &euro;315 million per annum is being taken in by private companies and a semi-State company for doing absolutely nothing.  As far as the Government is concerned, these companies should be allowed to pocket that money, although it is being taken directly from young families that are struggling to cope.  The proposals before the House would have a direct impact on our competitiveness <Col N="474"/>by reducing inflation by 0.2% and would act as a direct stimulus to the economy, which is badly needed.</P>
        <P>In recent years, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has plummeted by 17 places in the rankings, resulting in mounting business costs and inflation, yet the attitude of Government Members is to blame it on external factors and say it has nothing to do with them.  They are burying their heads in the sand.  The Government&rsquo;s response to the flagging construction industry and housing sector was put across well by the former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, whose approach was to suggest that people move to the UK and get jobs in the industry there.  Sadly, that is what is happening in my constituency.  Young men travel up to Knock Airport on Monday morning, get on a plane and fly to London, work there during the week and fly back on Friday evening.  That is not acceptable.  These are men with young families who must commute to the UK on a weekly basis.</P>
        <P>This proposal would give a badly needed boost to our tourism industry, which has seen a 6% to 8% fall in the number of tourists from countries other than the UK in the past few months.  The VAT take from kerosene is estimated to double this year, from &euro;77 million in 2007 to &euro;144 million in 2008.  The EU oil price bulletin shows that home heating oil in Ireland is the most expensive in the EU and is 24% more expensive than diesel even though they are basically identical products.  In 23 member states, home heating oil is cheaper than diesel, but in this country the opposite is the case.  If we could even get our prices down to European levels Irish families would save &euro;50 million a year.  Irish families are struggling because of the incompetence of the Government, which refused to put in place proper building standards in the past few years to support its buddies in the construction industry.  Now the Government is saying it is not prepared to support young families who are trying to cope with the energy crisis and the increasing cost of living.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to pick out a few key phrases from the Government amendment.  &ldquo;Long-term strategy&rdquo; is mentioned twice.  We see references to the Energy Policy Framework 2007-2020, a strategic framework up to 2020 and the aim of achieving zero net carbon emissions by 2035, which is 27 years away.  The situation is said to be subject to ongoing examination by the Departments of Finance and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and we are told there will be no free carbon allowances after 2012.  There is not one mention of the short term or the medium term but only the long-term strategy.  There is no mention of the here and now or of the people who must pay up to &euro;1,000 for 1,000 litres of home heating fuel.  There is no mention of how people in the haulage industry or the fishing sector are to deal with their short to medium-term needs.  It is an absolute abdication of responsibility.  It is cute-hoorism at its worst.</P>
        <P>A gentleman named Deputy Bertie Ahern, a former leader, sat in the chair where the Minister of State is sitting now.  When history is written he may be the man who is given credit for the Celtic tiger and he may smile and say he was the man who delivered the Celtic tiger, but the impending economic recession is the elephant in the room.  Not one Member on that side of the House, including the noble Green Party Members, one of whom is <i>en route</i> to Luxembourg, is prepared to take on that elephant.  They will blame the United States and the Middle East.  They are prepared to abdicate their responsibility in trying to tackle this issue in the Chamber.  A person once said &ldquo;How do you eat an elephant?&rdquo;  The answer is &ldquo;One bite at a time&rdquo;.  What we are trying to do on this side of the House is offer a suggestion that we decrease the VAT rate from 13.5% to 12.5%.  It will not change the economy overnight, but it is a bit-part solution to a larger problem.  The irresponsibility and recklessness of the opposite side of the House in stating that our suggestion is not even worth examining is disgraceful.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>That we are unprepared to tackle the problem disgraces the people.  There is a short-term solution in respect of the fishing industry, where the price of green diesel has increased from 25 cent to 80 cent in the past three years.  The solution is to introduce the &euro;20 million tie-up scheme, a scheme encouraged by the EU across the Union.  The Minister of State must ensure that the tie-up scheme is considered because the fishermen will have no medium term or long term if the here and now are not addressed.  This is the responsibility of the Government&rsquo;s side of the House.</P>
        <P>On today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, Mr. Barry Kenny, communications spokesperson for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, stated that there would never be a rail solution for the north west.  However, the Green Party has stated the opposite.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, is on record at the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as stating that he is willing to explore and examine the possibility of rail to the north west to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.  Mr. Kenny was reading the script of Government policy.  Fianna F&aacute;il is taking the hand of the Green Party Deputies.  They are talking the language and are thinking long term &mdash; 2012  and 2035 &mdash; but the reality of the here and now is not being addressed.</P>
        <P>We must consider practical solutions and I commend Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s motion.  His solution, while it would not create overnight miracles in the economy, would be a realistic start.  Last week in the House, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, had the audacity not to answer my question on the Ad Blue systems installed in new lorries by the haulage industry.  Those systems are environmentally friendly, but industry members are not being rewarded or compensated for installing them.  The haulage industry is on its knees.  The Minister of State knows of haulage contractors in County Sligo who are losing their jobs.  He also knows that only 3% of our rail services are being used to transport heavy freight with no plans to consider additionality.</P>
        <P>The people are struggling and are concerned by inflation in the cost of their food baskets, home heating oil and their mortgages.  As Deputy Naughten stated, they are also concerned about their sons and daughters getting on aeroplanes at Knock Airport and Belfast City Airport.  As there are no solutions in Ireland, people from County Donegal and elsewhere are going to London, finding a scarcity of work and considering solutions in Dubai, Australia or, illegally, America.  It is disgraceful that the Government has abdicated its responsibility to develop short-term and medium-term solutions.  Anyone who has condemned the motion in the House should ask his or her constituents whether it is right to call for a tax reduction to give back to the consumer and to decrease the cost of home heating oil.  Would the answer be &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  Since the Minister of State knows which, it is disgraceful that the Government will not even consider the possibility of discussing our practical solution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy Coveney on introducing this motion, which deals with improving competitiveness, reducing inflation and helping to reduce poverty by cutting the lower rate of value added tax from 13.5% to 12.5%.  When the country was banjaxed in the late 1980s, Fine Gael, under the leadership of Mr. Alan Dukes, introduced the Tallaght strategy.  We developed ideas and were supportive of the Government at a difficult time.  I am not an aggressive politician, but people from the other side of the House have been telling Fine Gael to develop ideas for years.  However, Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s enterprising idea is being rejected out of hand by a tired Government lacking its own ideas.  As the Government needs the Opposition&rsquo;s help, I appeal to the former to accept Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s solution.</P><Col N="476"/>
        <P>The credit crunch is having a significant effect on business, particularly small businesses, a category in which I include myself.  Many small and innovative businesses have spent years addressing various issues, but the cost of being in business will put them out of operation.  The issue between the public and private sectors is significant.  The latter has been neglected for too long, but it is too late to save it.  Anything that would encourage businesses to be competitive and give them a breath of fresh air would be helpful.  I commend the Deputy&rsquo;s solution in this regard.</P>
        <P>House completions have bottomed out at 25,000, the building sector is banjaxed and the tourism industry is under severe pressure.  The increase in oil prices is putting the transport industry under pressure.  Bringing the matter to the human level, our shop sells &euro;5 ESB meter cards as a service to normal people who are in receipt of social security payments and are under serious pressure.  These people come to my door at 11 p.m. or midnight because their electricity has stopped and they have needed to take the &euro;5 or &euro;10 from elsewhere.  Most of us are fortunate enough to live in well insulated houses with ESB storage heating, which is reasonably good.  However, most of the people in the situation I have outlined live in local authority housing built in the 1970s and 1980s.  Since those houses have no insulation, they cost twice as much to heat as ours.  Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s solution will help to reduce the cost of electricity.  Sometimes, the houses I visit are colder than it is outside.  Anything I can do to help people get through their difficult times would be reasonable.</P>
        <P>Regarding the windfall levy and the cut in the VAT rate, reducing the 21% rate would have a greater impact on inflation, but there would be fewer benefits for the poor.  Deputy Coveney has introduced the motion to address this matter, given that the poor, as opposed to higher income households, spend most of their income in the 13.5% rate bracket.  Last year, Spain introduced a windfall levy for this reason and the UK Treasury is considering a proposal by the energy regulator.</P>
        <P>Introducing the environmental issue is nonsense.  Fine Gael has developed a positive and innovative solution to a serious situation.  I have highlighted how the vulnerable are being targeted and how our suggestion will help them to reduce their bills.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the important topic of energy and taxation.  During the course of the debate, Deputies have made some interesting contributions.  My colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, have set out the Government&rsquo;s response to the proposal.</P>
        <P>This morning, having followed the debate closely, I echo the comments made by them and respond to some of the issues raised.  With regard to the economy, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, rightly pointed out, it is important that energy and taxation policy are framed in the context of the current economic situation and the current challenges we face. The economic environment has clearly become more challenging in recent months.  A number of the risks identified at budget time have subsequently materialised, although, as already pointed out in the debate, most of these developments are on the external side and effectively beyond our control.</P>
        <P>On the domestic front, we are all aware of the sharp slowdown in the residential house building sector.  While we may experience a year or two of fairly low levels of completions, it is reasonable to expect over the medium term that annual completions will return to sustainable levels which will remain high by international standards, reflecting the strong underlying demand for housing in Ireland.  It is of interest to note that the economy&rsquo;s flexibility and <Col N="477"/>resilience was one of the main themes of the recently published medium-term review by the ESRI.  The ESRI shares the Government&rsquo;s view in that we should see a return to trend growth from 2010 onwards.  In other words, we are dealing with the challenges from a position of strength.</P>
        <P>In terms of the public finances, there can be no denying that our fiscal position has changed from that envisaged at budget time.  It is important, however, to point out that the current situation is manageable, given the strong position of the public finances. It is equally important to stress that, despite the underlying strength of the public finances, the Government is determined that there will be no unnecessary loosening of fiscal policy.  We must control current spending to keep it in line with resources and it is crucial for Departments to adhere to the significant levels of current day-to-day expenditure provided for their activities this year.</P>
        <P>Energy, investment and taxation policy, to name but a few areas, must be framed in this context.  Regarding energy policy, which is key to our future economic growth, the Minister for Communication, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, has set out the considerable progress being made in terms of commitments and actions under the energy policy framework.  Global developments regarding the continuing high price of oil and fossil fuels with climate change present significant challenges.  These must be addressed in the context of the wider economic and competitiveness needs of the economy, having regard to emerging budgetary realities.</P>
        <P>I wish to turn to the issue of taxing carbon-related windfall gains in the electricity generating sector, which forms one side of the equation proposed under the motion.  The issue of windfall gains to electricity generating companies that arise as a result of the free allocation of carbon allowances under the EU&rsquo;s emissions trading scheme is a complex one.  Deputy Burton raised a number of relevant and interesting points in this regard last night.  It is an international issue and one that faces not only Ireland, but all EU member states.  This issue is subject to an ongoing examination by the Department of Finance and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources which will take account of all implications and in particular the need to be certain about the effectiveness of any initiative.  However, it has already been mentioned that only one EU member state has introduced measures to deal with this issue and these are now subject to appeal and legal challenge.  Against this background, it is clear that the issue requires very careful and in-depth examination.</P>
        <P>It must be recognised that 70% of the free carbon credits allocated to the power generation sector were allocated to the ESB, a public sector company.  As we have heard, it is proposed that from 2013 allowances will be auctioned and this issue will no longer arise.  For the coming years, it will be a matter for consideration.  However, there is an argument that putting a levy on windfall gains of electricity generating companies could seriously hinder the development of alternative energy sources.  Yesterday in this House the Taoiseach stated that it is important to point out that the revenues available to the ESB and others are factored into their capital programmes for providing alternative energy sources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should be honest.  It is a carbon tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of such sources and technologies is key to lowering our high dependency on fossil fuels and delivering a sustainable energy platform into the future.  As the Minister for Finance has pointed out, Ireland has a low burden of taxation in respect of labour and capital, a policy that has stood us well up to now and one which the Government is intent on maintaining.  On the indirect taxes side, our broad but balanced application of VAT has served to protect the less well-off by applying, for example, the zero rate of VAT to food, <Col N="478"/>children&rsquo;s clothes and footwear and medicines.  In addition, Ireland is one of only eight EU member states which applies the reduced VAT rate to electricity.</P>
        <P>It is worth recounting the experience of 2001 when the standard rate of VAT was cut by 1% from 21% to 20%.  The outcome of this move clearly demonstrated that the expected benefits for the consumer did not materialise because the reduction in VAT was simply not passed on to the consumer.  I recommend the amended motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government swallowed that notion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Coveney.  I congratulate him on bringing this proposal before the D&aacute;il with the aim, initially, of creating a fund through the unearned windfall gains to the electricity generator industry which in turn would allow the value of the tax rate to be lowered from 13.5% to 12.5%.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to hear Government backbenchers and Ministers trying to blame other economic problems on issues outside the Government&rsquo;s control.  It is even more interesting to hear them so quickly describe as rubbish any proposal from this side of the House when every other week they have claimed that in Private Members&rsquo; time Fine Gael has failed to put forward realistic proposals and that it always opposes for the sake of opposition.</P>
        <P>I will not go into detail on the issues already discussed by Deputy Coveney regarding windfall tax and how that might provide the necessary funding, other than to say that to date the Government has refused to claw back this money for the benefit of customers, the economy and the environment.</P>
        <P>The current crisis in the economy needs definite and short-term action. Government proposals, while very laudable, have clearly failed in the past to come to fruition within a reasonable timeframe.  For instance, the Government ignored the nitrates directive for 12 years and eventually dealt with it only when under legal and political pressure from other EU member states. Any commitments by the Government, which has been in power for 11 years, must be taken with a serious health warning.</P>
        <P>Our country is now in a serious economic downturn with consistent high inflation, rising job losses and increased difficulties in obtaining jobs by those involved in the manufacturing business.  The Government has stubbornly refused to recognise the seriousness of our economic slide and persists in blaming external factors such as the value of the euro against sterling and the dollar, the price of oil and the difficulties in the international money markets.  No doubt these have had some effect but we cannot ignore the total mismanagement of our economy and the fact that we relied so much on the unsustainable house building trade and windfall taxes received by Government from ever-increasing and totally overvalued development land prices.  I remember one small farm in my area that went from a valuation of approximately &euro;2 million to a sales value of &euro;25 million in less than three years. The Government received an unexpected &euro;7.5 million in tax and stamp duty from that totally unexpected sale due to the early death of its owner.</P>
        <P>We are now in a new situation and today Fine Gael is trying to give the Government a positive alternative to sitting back and ignoring the problem, hoping that it will disappear.  That will not happen.  A 1% VAT reduction would help to cut the cost of many necessities in life such as heating oil, especially for our elderly and disabled who have need of such products 52 weeks a year. It will also reduce the cost of diesel oil to farmers and contractors.  In light of the pressures on farmers, who face cutbacks in dairy and other products as well as increased feed prices, any help that can be given by the State, however small, will show some understand<Col N="479"/>ing.  It would give a direct boost to the domestic economy and, above all, give assistance to the flagging construction and housing sectors.</P>
        <P>Tourism is now one of our biggest industries and is under severe pressure because of the current situation.  If the 13.5% rate were lowered to 12.5%, this would be noticed immediately in the cost of accommodation, car hire, etc., and would give a clear message that the Government is committed to tourism.  The reduction will affect the price of home heating oil, but also electricity, gas and coal.  Above all, it will reduce the income gap as low income households will benefit more than higher income households, as they spend more income on services taxed at this rate.</P>
        <P>I understand the Department of Finance estimates the cost of cutting the 13.5% VAT rate to 12.5% at just less than &euro;400 million in a full year.  However, taking into account the extra spending and economic activity resulting from such a cut, Fine Gael believes the net cost would be less than &euro;300 million.  This figure is, in turn, less than what the proceeds from a windfall levy in the electricity generating sector would be.  Spain has already introduced a windfall levy and the UK Treasury is considering a proposal from the UK energy regulator.  I have heard the Government and its backbenchers emphasising that there is no guarantee that the 1% VAT reduction would be passed on to consumers.  If this is the case, what is the purpose of the regulators, consumer organisations and all other special structures put in place by the Government over the past 11 years which are supposed to protect the consumer?  If the Government does not accept this proposal, as seems likely, I urge it to take alternative action now before it is too late for the many companies, jobs and all those already living on the bread line because of rising inflation, fuel prices and lack of Government concern.  Only some minutes ago I heard of another company going into liquidation.  We cannot ignore this situation and we must take action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I discuss the detail of what has been said by the Government side, I will spell out for the House the purpose of this motion on behalf of other Opposition parties and address some of the concerns raised.  There seems to be a perception that this is an attempt by Fine Gael to have a general motion on energy policy, or a comprehensive economic recovery package for Ireland.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a specific proposal brought forward by Fine Gael because there will be a specific lump sum of money which will be paid for by businesses and households over the next five years, a figure of approximately between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;2 billion.  We want to see that money spent properly, which is the principle behind the motion, because it is taxpayers&rsquo; money.  The way in which the electricity regulatory environment has developed requires power generation companies to charge for the international cost of carbon, which is between &euro;24 and &euro;25 per tonne.  As a result everybody&rsquo;s electricity bill here is higher than it otherwise would be if power generators were not required to add on to their bill an amount equivalent to the international cost of carbon.</P>
        <P>Power generation companies for the next five years until the end of 2012 are being given a free allocation of carbon allowances to enable them to emit a certain amount of carbon into the environment without cost.  They are gaining on the back of consumers and it does not cost them anything.  The essence of this motion is that consumers will pay &euro;1.6 billion per year for the next five years on top of existing electricity bills.  This is based on the average cost of carbon being &euro;25 per tonne, which is a very conservative figure.  We need to decide who gets the money and the way to spend it.  Is it appropriate to allow the money to go into the coffers of the ESB, Viridian or any other power generation company to which this allowance applies?  Alternatively, should we, as legislators and representatives of the people, decide how the &euro;1.5 billion is spent for the betterment of the economy, society and the environment?  These are the three areas on which the motion impinges and these are the questions we ask.</P><Col N="480"/>
        <P>This motion is not about the future direction of Government energy strategy as the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, seemed to suggest in an arrogant way before he shuffled off to Luxembourg earlier.  This is about the way we spend a carbon tax, which is being introduced by stealth.  I agree with factoring the cost of carbon into the price of electricity.  However, if we are to factor in this cost let us be honest with people, tell them it is a carbon tax and then tell them how we will spend their hard earned money paid in taxes.  Instead, what is happening is that people have no idea they are paying an extra 10% in bills for the cost of carbon.  Instead, people are fed the line by Government and others that the price of energy is increasing because of the international price of oil.  This is a factor, but not the only one.</P>
        <P>The policy decision has been made by the regulator to incentivise power generators to produce electricity in a carbon-efficient way and to charge for the cost of carbon.  The money is being paid as we speak, yet the Government allows what amounts to a stealth carbon tax to continue to be paid by the consumer because it is not being up front and honest with businesses and households about what is happening.  We are not discussing a small amount of money.</P>
        <P>For Fine Gael, the principle for dealing with carbon taxation is simple.  We need to encourage &mdash; indeed, insist on &mdash; a change in behaviour that will reduce carbon emissions and the carbon footprint of companies and people in the future.  We agree with the regulatory decision made.  However, we do not agree with the system whereby this money will not be recycled into the economy and given back to taxpayers in some other way.  If there is to be a carbon tax, it should not be used as simply a revenue raising exercise, which is not the purpose of such a tax; carbon taxation should be revenue neutral.</P>
        <P>Putting a value on carbon emissions should help to change people&rsquo;s habits and force a change in the way we think.  At the same time we should recycle the money to provide tax relief for the consumer.  If we are to take more from the consumer to change carbon consumption habits, let us give it back in another area so that the net tax paid by businesses and consumers remains the same.  This is the main principle behind this proposal.</P>
        <P>This motion covers two issues and I appeal to the Government to consider the two separately and then collectively.  The Government should decide quickly if it will recoup gains made by the power generation companies free of charge on the back of consumers.  Then let us have a debate on the best way to spend the money.  Fine Gael has made its decision on this matter.  We believe the lower rate of VAT should be cut because it represents a good deal in the current economic and social conditions, where people are put to the pin of their collar to heat their homes and where the construction industry is on its knees.  The 13.5% VAT rate applies to that sector along with the services sector, tourism and many other sectors requiring stimulus at the moment.  This is the reason we have chosen this motion.  This is one of a series of packages of economic stimuli that Fine Gael will bring forward in the coming weeks and months, yet, we hear nothing from the Government in its response to the motion except that it will continue to implement the stability-oriented fiscal policies that have underpinned the success of the economy over a decade.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s fiscal policies have caused the current panic in the economy.  The Government did not plan for a rainy day when it had the resources to do so.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Finance has accepted this is an issue and that he and his Department, together with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, plan to examine it.</P>
        <P>In his contribution earlier today, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, misled the House on two issues.  The first relates to his claim that the single electricity market committee is opposed to the Fine Gael proposal.  This is untrue.  The committee has stated that windfall gains could be used for the benefit of consumers and <Col N="481"/>that this is a decision for the Government.  Second, the Minister accused Fine Gael of being opposed to the ESB&rsquo;s &euro;22 billion plan to reduce its carbon footprint dramatically in the next 20 years.  That is a disgraceful comment from the Minister.  He has seen my press releases, on behalf of Fine Gael, which welcome that strategy and encourage the ESB to move forward with it.</P>
        <P>The issue for Fine Gael is that we do not want the ESB&rsquo;s future capital investment programmes to be funded via a carbon tax without the knowledge of consumers that the moneys they have contributed are being used for that purpose.  If we expect them to pay that tax, we should be honest and tell consumers and businesses that they will pay up to &euro;2 billion in carbon taxation in the next five years and how that money will be spent.  That is how honest Government works.</P>
        <P>Instead, however, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, comes into the House and dismisses Fine Gael proposals in such a way as to suggest that we do not care about climate change.  At the same time, he asks for consensus so that we can create a green economy which prioritises a reduction in carbon emissions in the next ten to 20 years.  This is something I am happy to do.  However, when it suits the Minister politically, he dismisses our sensible, well thought out and properly costed suggestions.  These proposals make economic, social and environmental sense.  Most importantly, they do nothing to reduce the incentives that have been put in place under the regulatory regime to encourage a change from fossil fuels to cleaner and more efficient energy generation.  Our proposal does nothing to impinge on what this policy, which Fine Gael supports, seeks to achieve.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

        <Quest> the reason dedicated palliative care funding announced by her in 2006 and 2007 was not expended on palliative care services; if she has taken steps to ensure the Health Service Executive will repay funding that was redirected away from palliative care services in order that it will be dedicated to the development of palliative care services; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22486/08]</QRef>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2007, overall spending by the HSE on palliative care services amounted to &euro;75 million.  That includes some, but not all, of the additional &euro;18 million funding that was provided by the Government in budgets 2006 and 2007.  The HSE has advised me that some of the remaining funding was used in other parts of its services, particularly in acute hospitals.  Clearly, the HSE has to operate within the resources made available to it in any given year.  However, that should not mean that new funding provided by the Government for specific service enhancements is redirected to other purposes.  Accordingly, we need to focus on improving the <Col N="483"/>management of existing services and associated funding.  In particular, making better use of existing capacity within acute hospitals and managing hospital activity on a planned basis would deliver better hospital services and, at the same time, allow primary and community services to be improved in line with the Government&rsquo;s plans.</P>
        <P>My primary concern in regard to palliative care services at this stage is to remove existing regional disparities and enhance palliative care services throughout the country.  The HSE is currently finalising a plan for the development of palliative care services on a national basis.  That is being done in consultation with the Irish Association for Palliative Care, the Irish Hospice Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society.  I have asked the HSE to ensure that the implementation of this plan is prioritised within its overall resources and its service planning process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that it is the Minister&rsquo;s role to advise the HSE on the strategic development of the health service through the identification of areas of need, the setting of targets and the allocation of specific resources to achieve targets?  Did the Minister not make specific commitments on palliative care and promise that during 2006 and 2007 some &euro;18 million of Government funding would be dedicated to the purpose?  However, when it came to applying the resources the HSE decided to divert the funding away from palliative care to meet core deficits in other areas.  When was the Minister made aware that the funding was diverted away from the development of palliative care services?  Did she give approval to Professor Drumm to divert resources away from its intended purpose and, if not, what action does she intend to take to ensure that funding allocated to palliative care services will be replaced?</P>
        <P>Is it not the case that any budget that is unused is taken back &mdash; or as someone put it, robbed back &mdash; by the HSE?  It appears that the HSE can implement its own policy regardless of the Department of Health and Children or the Government and that by failing to spend money in an allocated area the funding is taken back to be used at its discretion.  Does that not undermine democracy and the value of any promise the Minister, the Government or any Government can make if the HSE can undermine policy in such a fashion and through either deliberate obstruction or incompetence not allow people to use up the budgets for recruitment?  Is it not the case that HSE south has filled only 17.5 posts out of 33, Dublin north east region has only filled six posts out of 26 whole time equivalents and Dublin mid-Leinster has filled only 15 posts out of 38?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister correct the situation that pertains?  When was she made aware that the funding was diverted?  Did Professor Drumm ask for permission to do that?  What is the point of having policy directives and allocations if the HSE can through various mechanisms redirect that money to wherever it deems fit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, the HSE like every other organisation has to live within the resources allocated to it.  If they do not do that, they cannot have priorities or make plans and it would be highly disruptive.  For the past couple of years we are aware that the new development moneys, including in palliative care, have been redirected to deal with day-to-day issues.  For example, last year I understand an extra &euro;40 million was spent on drugs for cancer patients that had not been envisaged at the start of the year.  Clearly, the executive&rsquo;s priority has to be to live within the resources allocated to it.  The Deputy&rsquo;s colleague spoke this morning, as he has done on many occasions, about the fact that we are spending too much.  In the past three years we have put in three additional beds in Blackrock, four in Galway, ten in Milford, two in Waterford and six in the Curragh.  This year an additional &euro;3 million was allocated to palliative care and I have asked the HSE to ensure that money is spent on service delivery, in <Col N="484"/>particular, in those areas where there are huge regional disparities in the provision of palliative care inpatient beds.  One such area is the midlands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>We have just 50 seconds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister answer the question?  When did she find out and did Professor Brendan Drumm seek permission?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, he does not require permission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>When did the Minister find out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Find out what?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>That the money had been reallocated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been well known for the past couple of years that new development moneys, including in the mental health and disability sector, were not all used in those sectors.  That has been known at the end of each year in 2006 and 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>So the Minister has known for a couple of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>At the end of each year we know whether the new developments took place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Basically, the Minister knew it in 2006&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The HSE produces&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and she allowed it to happen again in 2007, and we can expect more of the same in 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The organisation has to live within the resources allocated to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the HSE&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should be allowed to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;not reallocate funding from administration or the burgeoning bureaucracy?  It does not do that, it takes it off front line services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy allow the Minister to conclude?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it does not take it off front line services.  We had no palliative care specialty or facilities a couple of years ago.  Ireland was the second worst country in Europe.  In addition to the inpatient services we are developing, we also have huge investment in home care services in palliative care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I come back on that point?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="485"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that in the midlands and the north east where the HSE is responsible, as opposed to the voluntary sector, only 20% of posts have been put in place.  In the other areas where voluntary organisations are in charge, who are interested in patient care, the uptake is much higher.  That speaks volumes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The voluntary organisations are supported by the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind colleagues of Standing Orders.  They require that I now proceed to Ceist Uimhir a d&oacute;.  I apologise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Much of the support for the voluntary organisations comes from the HSE.  For example, the Blackrock Hospice is a voluntary organisation but the activity is funded by the HSE.  Equally, while the HSE is not directly providing the beds itself, it is funding various hospices around the country to provide the service.  In Milford, for example, which I visited on a number of occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest> if her Department has planned for the effect of the transfer of private patients from public hospitals where co-location is to proceed; the cost implications for the running of those hospitals; the staffing implications particularly where specialist clinical staff will be required in both hospitals; the way it is proposed that public patients will have access to the private facility; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22312/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of the co-location initiative is to make available approximately 1,000 additional public acute hospital beds for public patients by transferring private activity, with some limited exceptions, from public acute hospitals to co-located private hospitals.</P>
        <P>The process for the development of the co-located private hospitals is governed in each case by a detailed project agreement between the public hospital and the developers of the private hospital.  The HSE has retained external professional advisers in regard to the procurement, financing and legal aspects of the process in order to ensure that the public interest is protected at all times.  Detailed provisions in regard to all aspects of the relationship between public hospitals and co-located private hospitals will be the subject of a service level agreement between the parties in each case.</P><Col N="486"/>
        <P>The revenue cost to the public hospitals will be minimal.  That is because the beds in public hospitals which will be freed up for public patients are already staffed and the back-up services and facilities required to support them are in place.  The only staffing cost envisaged is the appointment of additional consultants, something that the Government is now doing in the light of the agreement.  The loss of private health insurance income to the hospitals from private health insurers is estimated at &euro;80 million in respect of the six sites where the co-location initiative is most advanced.  That loss of income will be mitigated, in part, through income from the lease of the land and a potential share of profits from the co-located facility.  It is recognised that provision will need to be made to allow the budgets of participating public hospitals to be adjusted appropriately to reflect the net private patient income forgone.</P>
        <P>Public patients will have access to the private facilities under the service level agreements between the public and private partners.  Under the terms of the Finance Act 2001, the co-located hospital must ensure that at least 20% of its bed capacity is made available to the HSE for the treatment of individuals awaiting inpatient or outpatient hospital services as public patients.  The fees charged must be not be more than 90% of the fees that would be charged for equivalent treatment provided to a patient with medical insurance.</P>
        <P>The staffing and operating costs of the co-located hospital will be a matter for the private partner.  In accordance with the recommendation of the independent chairman of the consultant contract talks, discussions will take place between health service employers and the consultants&rsquo; representative organisations on the practical issues arising from co-location, where appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am confused.  Is the Minister suggesting there will be two identical hospitals with, for example, two clinical teams from cardiology to orthopaedics on both sides?  For example, in order to cover for someone needing appendectomy in the middle of the night, will two full teams be needed, one in each of the two hospitals?  If someone breaks a hip, will full teams be needed in both hospitals to deal with all the different specialties?  People who work in the hospitals are puzzled about that.</P>
        <P>This initiative was announced three years ago.  Its purpose was to bring extra beds into the system.  Three years later no sod is turned on any of those hospitals.  We are now told the banks may be holding up their development because, in spite of them being PPPs, they want a guarantee that the State will ensure there is no loss of money.</P>
        <P>The public does not understand what will happen here.  Will we have two completely separate hospitals?  The Minister has often said that in the area of cancer a minimum throughput of patients is needed and that we should have eight centres of excellence.  However, in all the other specialties we will separate the private and public patients and have separate groups of doctors delivering the service.  I do not understand that and it does not seem to fit in with what she says about cancer and the need for specialists to deal with a large number of patients in any one specialty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised at the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  St. Vincent&rsquo;s and the Mater in Dublin are two cancer centres with co-located facilities.  There will be a single clinical governance on the site.  Clearly, the whole purpose of the initiative is to free up approximately 1,000 beds.  In the case of these six hospitals, we are talking about 600 beds.  Those 600 beds will be provided for &euro;80 million in addition to 300 day beds that are used for private patients, so we will get 600 inpatient beds and 300 day beds for &euro;80 million.  At the moment for &euro;80 million we would get approximately 230 inpatient beds so it is terrific value for money.</P>
        <P>In the main, the same consultants will work in both.  Under the new contract of employment the private activity of consultants is greatly restricted.  The idea is that the private work on fee-<Col N="487"/>paying patients, who are paying themselves or through their medical insurance, would be done in the co-located facility.  The idea is that the two hospitals would complement each other.  When we announced this initiative, hospitals were free to apply to participate.  The hospital boards, and in particular the medical boards, of the hospitals chose to apply for sanction under the initiative.</P>
        <P>The idea for the initiative came from a group of consultants in a regional hospital, who suggested to me that if they could free up the 70 beds used by private patients they would cover those beds for public patients if a private facility could be built adjoining their hospital.  When the idea was researched and analysed under the public sector benchmark, it proved it would deliver terrific value for money for the taxpayers.  In terms of the capital cost, it delivers the beds for less than 50% of the cost of doing it the traditional way.  In terms of the running costs, instead of getting 230 beds, we are getting 600 inpatient beds and approximately 300 beds in the rest of the hospital that are used for fee-paying patients but are not ring-fenced for private patients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Consultants will now be able to sign up to three different kinds of contracts.  In addition, some consultants can opt to work entirely for private hospitals.  How will it work?  For example, how will it work in practice if a cardiologist signs up for one particular contract without the proper mix of public and private?  Will we need another cardiologist in the private or the public hospital?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, we have approximately 50% of the consultants we need and we will double that.  We have advertised for 128 new consultants so that we will have consultant-delivered services.  The arrangements will not be made centrally, but will be made on the ground at each hospital.  The private provider will be responsible for the employment of all the staff to run the private facility.  There will be no liability whatever on the taxpayers in that regard.  There may well be people who will only work in the private facility.  However, many of the doctors in hospitals such as St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont will be people employed to work in the public hospital and will do their private work, which they are entitled to do if they opt for two of the contracts, in the private facility on site or in some cases under the existing category 2 contracts they can do that work off-site.  We have three different contracts of employment for consultants.  The ones who do full-time public work will only work in the public hospital.  They clearly will not get any fees in addition to their full-time salaries.  Therefore, the issue of working in the private facility does not arise in their case.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the primary care strategy has not been rolled out in line with the commitments given in the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, which promised the delivery of 300 teams by 2008; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst><Col N="488"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The key objective of the primary care strategy is to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, home helps and others.  It is clear that the membership of primary care teams and networks are drawn from existing professional and other staff working in primary, continuing and community care services, and that there would also be a major enhancement of the level and nature of services available in those settings.</P>
        <P>There have been substantial enhancements in the services provided in primary and community care settings with corresponding increases in the numbers of staff concerned.  At this stage, the main focus needs to be on the reorganisation of existing services and staff into primary care teams and networks.  This requires changes in work practices and reporting relationships, with an emphasis on joint working by various health professionals.  It also requires significant work in mapping and profiling of areas.  Work under many of these headings is well advanced and I am pleased with the level of interest in, and engagement with, primary care teams among general practitioners.  I understand that 500 general practitioners are involved in the development of teams, with a further 700 projected to become involved.</P>
        <P>Specific additional funding was provided the years from 2006 to 2008 to facilitate the roll-out of extra primary care teams.  Some of this funding was used to appoint extra front line professional staff.  I emphasised to the HSE the importance I attach to the continued development and roll-out of primary care teams.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government announced the primary health care strategy way back in 2001.  Now seven years later all we have are virtual teams.  I believe that there might be ten or 11 projects that have seen the light of day.  When the Minister talks about the funding, is it not the case that in many of the areas where 13 were supposed to be put in place, three ended up being appointed.  While it is clear to me and others involved in primary care, the question must be asked as to whether the primary care strategy is dead.  The original funding will not happen as the Minister said in 2005.  Is it not the case that the HSE is now rapidly creating phantom primary care teams?  Where GPs expressed an interest in primary care teams, this is now construed as being active participation and is meaningless.</P>
        <P>Not alone has the failure of the Government to keep its promise to fund primary care to the tune of &euro;1.1 billion as promised by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Martin, been extremely damaging, but because it was in the pipeline it stymied many developments that might otherwise have taken place in general practice, some of which are now starting to come on stream as people realise that the funding will not be provided and these developments will not take place so people need to look to themselves to try to make things better.  The situation has got so bad that this morning Senator Liam Twomey issued a statement pointing out that a GP cannot even get a blood test carried out for an elderly lady.  If he is to repeat that, the laboratory still cannot guarantee it will be able to do the test because it has not got the resources.  How is that for resourcing of primary health care?</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister pointed out, the funding as originally envisaged will not happen and there is no identifiable strategy to allow any of these developments to take place.  This is key.  Does the Minister agree that it is the HSE&rsquo;s view, through Professor Drumm, that primary care should take a much more active role?  How is that to happen in the absence of funding?  It is all the more laughable to talk of reducing bed numbers and not delivering the 3,000 promised.  The Minister mentioned co-location, which clearly will not work.  I understand why the banks are nervous.  The future of the NTPF under a change of Government will have to be reviewed.  That should be borne in mind.  Is the primary health care strategy dead?  What specific funding has the Minister made available?  She mentioned the past two years; the funding has been abysmal.</P>

        <P>Some 630 staff have been assigned to primary care teams and I had the opportunity to visit one of them in Castleisland last Friday.  It is not just about additionality but about how people work together and how the existing resource of public health nurses, physiotherapists, occu<Col N="490"/>pational therapists and GPs work in a community.  In the first instance, we want to get them to work as a team because they deal with the same patients.  We need better facilities.  The HSE recently sought expressions of interest on more than 100 sites around the country and there were 400 expressions of interest.  The first 18 contracts will be entered into very quickly and I welcome that level of interest from GPs and others around the country to provide the physical infrastructure so teams can operate effectively in a single centre.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have previously made it clear that I want to see appropriate staffing structures in place throughout our public health service.  This includes management structures and front line service delivery.  My main aim in management structures is to ensure clarity of roles, responsibilities and reporting relationships to improve the overall governance and management of our health services.  The board and management of the HSE have been considering possible improvements in their existing management structures which would optimise their operational or service delivery capacity.  These proposals are still being finalised and will be considered by me in the near future.</P>
        <P>Separately, the HSE has commissioned a review of its administrative staffing.  I understand this review indicates that the HSE is not over-resourced in clerical, administrative and managerial staff compared to Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Between December 2004 and March 2008, direct front line service staff in both the HSE national hospitals area and primary and community care have increased by approximately 10% while HSE corporate staff levels have reduced by a similar proportion.  A properly planned and managed voluntary redundancy scheme could have an important role in helping to streamline management within the HSE and, as a result, in improving the delivery of health services to patients.  Such a scheme would need to be built upon a clearly delineated organisational structure and the associated human resource requirements.  It would also need to demonstrate that it will deliver value for money, having regard to other options such as natural wastage and the scope for re-deployment.</P>
        <P>Discussions about a possible redundancy scheme are still at an exploratory stage.  In accordance with established practice in the public service, any such scheme would operate on a voluntary basis and would require the approval of the Minister for Finance.  There would also need to be discussions with the relevant staff associations.  This option requires further work but <Col N="491"/>could help deliver significant benefits in terms of a much more streamlined and integrated management structure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Reilly to try to stay within his time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do my best.  I remind the Minister that she did not read out the full paragraph of the report, as follows: &ldquo;The external report found that while the number of clerical, administrative and managerial staff compared favourably with those in similarly public owned health services in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, there were too many staff at senior level.&rdquo;  These are our famous grade eights of which there were six in 2000 and the last time I asked the Minister there were 714; perhaps it is gone up since then.  When the Minister has the information she might tell us the current figure.</P>
        <P>The report also said the proportionate number of managers within the overall clerical, administrative and managerial ranks was slightly higher than the UK National Health Service.  Would the Minister not agree that at the formation of the HSE she and her Government failed to bite the bullet?  They merged 11 companies and promised everybody they would not have to move job and that nobody would lose their job.  This was an impossible starting place.  As her Government failed to bite the bullet, patients are choking and dying on that bullet.</P>
        <P>In the past the Minister has said it would be premature to speculate about the appropriate staffing levels, yet we have report after report after report.  How many reports does the Minister need before she takes action?  Will she indicate when this much-needed re-balancing in the HSE away from administration and to the front line will take place?  Will it be done as a matter of urgency?  Has she any time lines by which she can measure it or will it be more fudge and fuddle?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I became Minister, 423 fewer people are working in the corporate headquarters of the HSE, 6,000 more people are working in hospitals and 5,600 more in primary care.  I could give Deputy Reilly all the percentages across all the professions.  One cannot decide in advance of establishing an organisation who should be made redundant.  Deputy Reilly knows that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It can be negotiated beforehand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The appropriate action is to establish an organisation on a statutory basis, which happened in January 2005, and charge the management and board of that organisation with making decisions on appropriate staffing levels.  I repeat that nothing on this scale has ever been embarked on in the public or private sector in Ireland by way of reorganisation and transformation.  We are in active discussion.  I have had no report on appropriate staffing levels.</P>
        <P>Deputy Reilly asked me how many reports I need.  The HSE commissioned two reports, one by McKinsey examining the management structure and one examining the clerical and administrative areas.  The first report is to hand.  The second is being completed with the board of the HSE.  I am in discussions with the chairman of the HSE, whom I will meet later with Professor Drumm, around some of these issues to ensure we have the appropriate management structure down the line.  At that point we will be able to decide where we need to redeploy people.  There are major disparities.  That is a hangover from the former health boards.</P>
        <P>Many of these famous grade eights were in acting positions under the former health boards.  Many are nurses and other professionals who became managers through industrial relations agreements, for example.  It is not correct of Deputy Reilly to suggest that a plethora of new <Col N="492"/>people have come in as managers.  That is not correct.  Many of them have resulted from industrial relations agreements.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked recently at the Committee on Health and Children how many additional ones we had approved in the past year.  I understand the answer is one and that the remainder were replacements for those who were moving on, retiring or otherwise.  We have approved one additional post in the area of child care.  There has been full scrutiny of all these positions in the Department of Health and Children for the past 12 months.</P>

        <Quest> her view on the findings of the Inspector of Mental Health Services who stated in her 2007 annual report that she has serious concerns regarding the conditions of long-stay wards in psychiatric hospitals, that the recruitment embargo has greatly impeded the development of mental health services and that there has been little progress in implementing A Vision for Change; if, in view of the development of a quality national mental health service, she will reconsider the decision to relocate the Central Mental Hospital to Thornton Hall in view of expert opinion and have it reconstructed on the current grounds of the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, County Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22489/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concerns of the Inspector of Mental Health Services regarding conditions in the long-stay wards of some psychiatric hospitals.  I point out in this regard that capital funding of &euro;145 million was provided and expended on the upgrading of mental health facilities under the National Development Plan 2000 to 2007 and additional funding of &euro;20 million per annum will be provided from the new plan in the period 2008 to 2011. </P>
        <P>A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy, recommends that a plan to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals be drawn up and implemented and that the resources released by these closures be protected for reinvestment in the mental <Col N="493"/>health service.  Work is advancing nationally on the process of replacing the remaining psychiatric hospitals with a range of modern health services.  I expect that closure plans for existing psychiatric hospitals will be put in place by the end of 2008.  These plans will have due regard to the preferences and the assessed needs of each patient.  I also understand that a comprehensive programme for the valuation and sale of mental health facilities is currently in progress.  Revenue raised from these sales will be directed towards improving mental health services.</P>
        <P>The recruitment pause put in place in September 2007 was initiated as part of the HSE financial break-even plan to facilitate the delivery of services on budget in accordance with the provisions of the 2007 national service plan.  This temporary pause in recruitment ended just three months later on 31 December 2007 and any posts falling vacant from 1 January 2008 can be filled, subject to the provisions of the HSE employment control framework for 2008.</P>
        <P>With regard to the implementation of A Vision for Change, the position is that the HSE recently approved an implementation plan which sets out six key priorities for 2008 and 2009.  Following concerns raised by the Office for Disability and Mental Health regarding the need for a longer-term focus, the HSE has indicated that it will prepare a more comprehensive plan before the end of this year.</P>
        <P>A Government decision in May 2006 approved the development of a new national forensic mental health facility at Thornton Hall, north County Dublin.  The new hospital will provide a therapeutic, forensic psychiatric service to the highest international standards.  The decision to relocate the Central Mental Hospital is consistent with A Vision for Change.  In the circumstances, there are no proposals to revisit the Government decision of May 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment as this is his first time to answer questions in the House.  I wish him well.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for his good wishes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State must be extremely concerned and appalled at the recently published report of the Inspector of Mental Health Services showing the unacceptable squalor that many psychiatric patients live in while the mental health services and the HSE are sitting on billions of euro worth of property, which the Minister of State has again committed to sell on behalf of the health services.  In 2006, over &euro;1.3 million worth of health service property was sold and &euro;776,000 worth was sold the following year, but all of the proceeds of the sales were surrendered to the Exchequer and nothing was reclaimed to fund developments in the psychiatric service.</P>
        <P>The inspector stated that the condition of our psychiatric services was poor, to put it mildly, as was the structural fabric of the hospitals.  She stated it was a running battle to keep ahead of damp, mould, falling plaster and peeling paint and that the funding needed to maintain these hospitals is considerable.  Does the Minister of State accept it is not acceptable that the most vulnerable people are forced to live in these conditions?  The commitments made since 1984 by various Ministers have not been implemented.  Given that there are no further funds for the introduction of A Vision for Change this year, how can we have confidence that something will be done?</P>
        <P>The problems filling the multidisciplinary teams and the vacancies that occurred had an enormous effect on the delivery of services in 2007, according to the inspector.  The problem is that the vacancies that occurred between September and October are not being filled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have also read the report of the Inspector of Mental Health Services, which was published on 29 May.  I am in this job three weeks and I give a full commitment that, whatever has happened before, I intend pushing forward immediately with the sale <Col N="494"/>of lands and properties owned by the HSE.  I do not intend to travel just for the sake of travelling.  The hospitals outlined specifically in the report need to be sold off.  I have asked the officials of the Department to draw up a current list of valuations.</P>
        <P>I intend to invite the Oireachtas Members who represent the specific areas to a meeting in Leinster House this month to get their public support for selling those properties.  I accept the views expressed in the report with regard to the need to move from the old days &mdash; some of these institutions have been there for 150 years &mdash; and to build proper modern facilities.  I intend to progress this and I will not make a report on progress next year or the year after, but on a six-monthly basis.</P>
        <P>Not all of the expressions in the commission&rsquo;s report are bad news and it is important to note the report is broadly positive.  I recognise not just the fact that facilities are poor, but also the positive structures which are moving us to a situation where we are doing what is right for people who suffer mental health difficulties.  The report highlights the significant changes that have occurred following the full implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001 and it makes the point that this includes the independent review system for those admitted involuntarily, which is important.  We had looked for this process for years but the tribunals are now in place.  All of these matters are positive.</P>
        <P>I ask that rather than being critical of what has happened, let us move forward on a positive note.  Following the meeting with Oireachtas Members, I intend to invite in all of the stakeholders, as the Minister, Deputy Harney, did in the area of cancer.  We can progress, evaluate and realise the valuable assets we have.  I give the following specific commitment.  What is raised in this area will go specifically and only into mental health.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the concern and the round rejection by all concerned with forensic medicine of the move of the Central Mental Hospital to Thornton Hall, will the Minister of State revisit this matter?  There is overwhelming expert opinion with regard to locating a therapeutic centre beside a custodial prison.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to be direct in all my answers.  I have no intention whatsoever of reviewing that.  The Deputy asked me some minutes ago how we were to implement A Vision for Change and what we were going to do for the psychiatric services.  The nonsense that we are talking about a prison and a hospital in the very same setting could not be further from the truth.  It is two separate approaches and two separate roads.  More importantly, if we are talking about scarce resources, the sale of Dundrum would realise &euro;350 million and the building of a hospital would cost &euro;150 million.  The balance of &euro;200 million will be invested in exactly what the Deputy is seeking.  I am as concerned about the patient as anybody else.  If the Deputy is blaming&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 66 together.</P>
        <P>Recognising the cross-cutting nature of the national disability strategy, the Government established the Office for Disability and Mental Health in January 2008.  This office helps me in exercising my functions as Minister of State with responsibility for disability and mental health across the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The office brings together responsibility for a range of different policy areas and State services which directly impact on the lives of people with disabilities and mental health issues.  The office will aim to bring about improvements in the manner by which services respond to the needs of people with disabilities and mental health issues by working to develop person centred services, focusing on the holistic needs of clients and service users and actively involving them in their own care.</P><Col N="496"/>
        <P>A key priority for the office is to support the implementation of the health sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005 and the planned implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  The office will focus in particular on facilitating the delivery of integrated health and education support services for children with special needs by further developing existing mechanisms for co-operation and co-ordination between the health and education sectors at national and local levels.</P>
        <P>A cross-sectoral team consisting of senior officials from the Office for Disability and Mental Health, the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science, the Health Service Executive and the National Council for Special Education meets on a regular basis to address issues arising in respect of the implementation of both Acts, as well as issues of cross-sectoral responsibility.  The focus of the team is on the interaction required between the education and health sectors in order to advance and enhance services to people with disabilities.  The matter raised by the Deputy regarding the provision of appropriate services to children with specific speech and language impairment must be considered within the overall context of preparations within the health and education sectors for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.  I have asked the cross-sectoral team to consider the matter in this context and to report back to me in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled this question last week for a written response and I received almost exactly the same reply.  I do not wish to begin on a feisty note but nowhere in the reply is reference made to speech and language therapy, even though this is the critical focus of my question.  I ask the Minister of State to pass that on to those who assist in the preparation of these responses.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State might take this opportunity to correct the remarks made by the Taoiseach on 14 May.  He caused concern within the sector by suggesting that the shortage of speech and language therapists was caused by the requirement on new graduate therapists to undergo a one year period of supervised clinical practice.  Does the Minister of State agree with the statement of the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment was ill informed and does he accept that one year of supervised clinical practice is an internationally recognised best practice approach for all health professionals?  Does he agree that the problem is not caused by the requirement on new graduates but by inadequate resourcing, insufficient posts to meet the demand for speech and language therapy and poor management by the HSE?</P>
        <P>Does he acknowledge that the services are not properly co-ordinated?  Implementation is required of the recommendation by the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists on a national working party.  The Minister of State referred to the cross-sectoral team but the critical difference between that and the proposed working party is that the latter would directly involve service users, including children and their parents, and the Department of Education and Science and the HSE.  That is clearly absent from the formula used in the replies given to the questions tabled today and last week.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge and welcome the 300% increase that has been made to the number of training places for speech and language therapists.  However, that will not work on its own if it is not matched by the development of critical posts.  With the recent HSE cuts, we face the prospect of increasing numbers of trained therapists leaving the country while children are deprived of the therapy they desperately need.  I ask the Minister of State and his departmental colleagues to ensure that the increased numbers of trained therapists are retained within the system and that posts are opened up.  They are clearly required given that children need intervention as early in their lives as possible.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="497"/>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his new position.</P>
        <P>I support Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s comments regarding the need to establish this group.  I am also concerned about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s claim that one year of supervision was somehow holding up the provision of services to people who need speech and language therapy when that is in fact the international norm for ensuring new therapists are clinically safe.  The record needs to be corrected by somebody in Government.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State consider it acceptable that children have to wait up to two years to receive the speech and language therapy they need at a crucial stage in their lives?  What will be done about that situation?  Due to embargoes and posts going unfilled despite the availability of trained graduates, that is the reality on the ground.</P>
        <P>I understand that disability services in certain parts of the country have not yet been given their budgets for 2008.  Can the Minister of State clarify that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the previous two speakers.  There are precedents for clinical supervision.  A newly qualified doctor has to serve an intern year under full supervision before being considered a fully fledged professional or continuing on to post-graduate training.  The Taoiseach was unwise to use that example.</P>
        <P>As I noted earlier, 4,136 Dublin children are waiting an average of 18 months for speech and language services.  If a child with autism does not receive an intervention between the ages of three and six, the window of opportunity is closed.  Half of that period could be spent in waiting.  It is an unacceptable situation and the Minister of State will have to address it in a more forceful manner than has formerly been the case.</P>
        <P>An entire class of physiotherapists have been trained at great expense and are badly needed for community and primary care, yet they are leaving the country because they cannot find employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in the business of correcting the Taoiseach because he is usually right.  I will not speak on his behalf until I consult him directly.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>He is achieving a status similar to that of papal infallibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>He is close enough to doing so.  I do not want to make little of the response.  However, I want to be as direct as possible.  I made the point that those involved with education for persons with special needs and the cross-sectoral team will meet shortly.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, established the new office with responsibility for disabilities and mental health, which has only been up and running since January last.  Prior to that issues had always arisen in respect of the HSE and the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science.  The establishment of the new office represents an attempt to deal with these issues in one place.  All of the issues to which the Deputy refers come within the remit of the office.  As reports are received in the coming months, it will be our responsibility to decide how to proceed, particularly in the context of learning and special educational needs.</P>
        <P>From the figures, one might obtain the impression that we are downgrading services.  I do not wish to use the time available to rattle off details of what has been achieved.  However, it is worth placing on record the fact that the number of physiotherapists has risen by 230, or 20%, that the number of occupational therapists has risen by 320, or 45%, and that the number of speech and language therapists has risen by 140, or 28%.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker><Col N="498"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that we are coming from a low base.  However, I ask the Deputy to bear in mind that the office was only recently established.  The Government recognises the importance of the work of the office.  It also accepts that we need to catch up quickly and that is what we are doing.</P>
        <P>The first priority on the agenda of the cross-sectoral teams is how the issues should be resolved and how the required professional staff should be put in place.  I ask the Deputy to give the office a 12-month settling down period.  When we return with a proposal in September or October, we will clearly show how we intend to deal with the matter of recruitment.  It must be remembered that there are industrial relations issues with which we must deal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State offer those physiotherapists who achieved of the order of 580 points to gain entry to courses and who are now fully trained an opportunity to earn decent incomes?</P>

	<P>In a previous reply, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, referred to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Will the Minister of State, in the context of question I posed, indicate where stands the commitment in the programme for Government to ensure that any child under five waiting more than three months &mdash; not the two years to which Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan refers &mdash; for occupational or speech and language therapy will be allowed to access these services automatically through the National Treatment Purchase Fund?

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>  the reason it is taking so long to process applications and appeals relating to the health repayment scheme; if she plans to address these delays; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[22149/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 32 together.</P>
        <P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly-funded long-term care.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, has advised that as of 16 May 2008, more than 14,000 offers of repayment totalling more than &euro;250 million have been made.  Further offers continue to be issued every week.  As a result of these offers, almost 10,500 payments worth in excess of  &euro;200 million have been made.  The HSE has indicated that the time taken to process each application varies depending on the complexity of the application and the availability of accurate records.  Every effort is being made to complete repayments as quickly as possible.  However, there have been some delays in making repayments under the scheme due to legal and technical issues.</P>
        <P>A very high number of deficiencies have appeared on claim forms and these must each be rectified before claims can be processed.  These claims have taken longer to process because the scheme administrator must be provided with certain information in order to ensure that the correct amount is repaid to the correct person.  The scheme administrator and the HSE have taken a proactive role in clearing these deficient claim forms.  They have conducted an intensive roadshow campaign throughout the country in order to address these issues.  This campaign was widely promoted through advertising on local radio and in regional media.</P>
        <P>More than 12,000 estates which lodged claims to date had not extracted a grant of representation in respect of the estate of the deceased patient.  In these instances, the person entitled to extract the grant of representation must be identified before an application can be processed.  To date, more than 11,000 certificates of entitlement permitting individuals to apply for repayments have issued.  The scheme administrator is confident that the majority of claims submitted by the public will be dealt with by the end of this month.</P>
        <P>The health repayment scheme appeals office is independent and was established to provide an appeals service to those who wish to appeal decisions made by the scheme administrator.  Following the establishment of the office, a temporary appeals officer was seconded from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  Subsequently, a recruitment process was undertaken by the Public Appointments Service and a panel of appeals officers has been established.  A second appeals officer is due to begin work shortly.  In addition, four administrative staff have been appointed to support the current appeals officer.</P>
        <P>Up to 23 May, the health repayment scheme appeals office had received 3,173 completed appeal forms.  The appeals officer must investigate each of these independently and his investigations can require additional reviews by the HSE and the scheme administrator.  Certain appeals present a high level of complexity.  In addition, a high percentage of appellants have requested oral hearings.  Up to the end of May, the appeals officer had completed 471 oral hearings at locations throughout the country.  Up to 23 May, the appeals officer had carefully, thoroughly considered and assessed 1,293 appeals and issued decisions in respect of all of them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="500"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am impressed that a single appeals officer has been able to deal with so many appeals.  If that sort of productivity existed throughout the health service, we would be doing extremely well.</P>
        <P>It is extraordinary that KPMG has been paid &euro;23 million &mdash; &euro;15 million exclusive of VAT &mdash; to administer the scheme.  Some 70,000 claims were expected, 39,000 were lodged and 14,000 have been settled and it is hoped that the matter will be dealt with in its entirety in the near future.</P>
        <P>People feel bamboozled and intimidated.  When they appeal, it becomes clear to them that the process is not about fairness but instead revolves around saving money.  That money was taken from the elderly illegally and now these people are being thwarted, in their later years, from obtaining justice.  Some 12% of processed claims have been appeals and only 25% of the appeals lodged and considered to date in respect of these claims have been successful.  A further 10% of applicants whose claims rejected were subsequently judged to be entitled to payment.</P>
        <P>It is clear that a great deal of activity is being focused on preventing people from recouping what is rightly theirs.  Despite the fact that 130,000 people work for the HSE, KPMG is being paid &euro;23 million to administer the scheme.  When people undergo the claims process and are obliged to appeal, they discover that there is only one appeals officer.  The Minister indicated that a recruitment process has been completed, that a panel has been established and that a second appeals officer will be appointed shortly.</P>
        <P>What is happening is nothing short of scandalous.  What sort of message is being sent to the elderly?  Having being short-changed by the State, the latter is now doing everything in its power to obstruct them from obtaining what is rightfully theirs.  Will the Minister indicate the number of appeal officers she intends to have in place by the end of the month so that this major issue might be dealt with?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be very brief.  What exactly is the role of KPMG and why was it brought in?  Does the Minister consider its service good value for money?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It was brought in because the HSE felt it would not be able to cope.  It has dealt with 39,000 claims and &euro;15 million exclusive of VAT would be regarded by any standards &mdash; especially with the overtime bills I see &mdash; as enormous value for money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many administrators in there already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>If we were to make the system, with its current staffing complement, deal with this issue, it would have been dealt with on an overtime basis.  It would have taken substantially longer and cost substantially more.  An assessment was made and that was the recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the thousands in the HSE who do not know what their jobs are?  They could be seconded for this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps some of the Deputy&rsquo;s friends in some of the vested interests could have done it.  Perhaps the Deputy should have put in a bid for it.  Some 39,000 claims have been dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>That is desperation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This money must be paid in accordance with the law enacted by the Oireachtas.  We must ensure, in the first instance, that the correct people are paid their money.  We do not want a family member or distant relative who may never have visited the old person <Col N="501"/>getting money that somebody else may be entitled to.  There is no doubt that it is a very complex legal process but this is necessary because of the law.</P>
        <P>With regard to the scheme, we appointed at the beginning an oversight group representative of various groups advocating older people.  Ms Sylvia Meehan is on it, for example, and it is chaired by Bernard Walsh, a geriatrician in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  They oversee this and have given me three reports.  I know they remain very satisfied and confident in the manner in which this scheme is being executed.  The purpose is to get money to the right people as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>As I indicated in my initial reply, the HSE has told me that by the end of June, all the applications will have been processed and determinations will be made.  We expect to finish it during this calendar year and do not envisage it going to 2009.  I am delighted this is the case.</P>
        <P>Sometimes, as a result of what we are dealing with, people who make the applications pass away.  We are dealing with very old people in residential care who may have been there for some time.  Many issues arise but the administrator and the HSE have operated this scheme very professionally and thoroughly.  Unfortunately, when legal letters are sent to individuals, particularly older people, I accept they can be intimidating.  Every effort is made to talk to people and I understand approximately 800 people were spoken to by telephone about their applications.  For example, different parts of the form may have been filled out that were not required or were inaccurate.  Every effort is made to deal with these people in as human a way as possible, particularly where older people are concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no wish to row with the Minister on the issue, which is very important.  I am glad she at least admits that letters can be intimidating, as can telephone calls.  People are confused.  I wish to ask her questions which require a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer.  Is she concerned at the high level of successful appeals, at 25%?  That is very significant.  Considering the large numbers, how many additional appeals officers will the Minister put in place by the end of the month if she hopes to finish the work?  The Minister has indicated the process is expected to finish at the end of this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might clarify the case of those in psychiatric institutions and the procedure for refunding such patients.  What is the position for psychiatric patients in community groups or supervised houses where deductions have taken place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>On those phone calls which have been made to elderly people, I understand they are mainly for clarification purposes.  Have there been any complaints regarding people feeling intimidated about phone calls received?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The only one I am aware of is that which arose in the newspaper last week and which was the subject of a D&aacute;il question by one of the Deputy&rsquo;s colleagues.  When I sought to establish the facts, they were very different from what had appeared.  The individual who made the application was in her early 80s, which in itself was unusual because generally the applicants are younger relatives or members of the family of the older person.</P>
        <P>I understand it related to the form not having been completed accurately, and a legal letter was sent.  The person who received it felt somewhat intimidated by the letter and thought the letter was indicating she would not get her money, which was not the case.  The letter &mdash; in legalese, which is intimidating for most of us &mdash; simply asked the applicant to clarify the documentation.</P>
        <P>Many of the applications are made by lawyers on behalf of individuals and I know of a large number of people where the solicitors have made an application on an applicant&rsquo;s behalf.  I understand that with the high number that came in just before Christmas, many were appli<Col N="502"/>cations made by legal representatives of deceased persons.  The same procedure applies for everybody under the Act in terms of the application process and scrutiny.</P>
        <P>On the appeals officers, we have indicated we need whatever number of appeals officers required to deal with the level of activity.  It has not been brought to my attention that there is a shortage, as I indicated.  More are being appointed on a temporary basis, and there are four administrative backup staff to help.  I have not heard that there is a shortage of appeals officers but if additional manpower is required to clear the appeals in a short space of time, it will not be a problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister concerned at the high number of successful appeals at 25%, given the amount paid to KPMG?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it 35%? I do not have that data.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is what I have in front of me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not have it.  If there was a high level of successful appeals, it would indicate first that the appeals process is working.  I do not have the figure read out by the Deputy from some note I presume he has from the HSE.  It is not in my note that it is as high as 35%.  I did say that of the number of appeal applications made, 35% have been dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I stated one in four &mdash; 25%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, one in four has been dealt with but my note does not tell me they have been successful.  I am sorry I do not have that information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in me staying here if the Minister will not answer my question.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>  the reason no action has been taken on foot of the Health Service Executive expert advisory group on diabetes report which was completed in September 2007; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[22245/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The diabetes expert advisory group was established by the Health Service Executive and presented its first report to HSE management in April 2008.  The expert advisory group made a number of recommendations relating to, for example, an integrated model of care for diabetes, clinical guidelines, ICT, education and empowerment of patients, retinopathy, podiatry and paediatric services.</P>
        <P>The expert advisory group is currently progressing recommendations related to standards and it is hoped to publish these shortly.  Clinical guidelines are to be formally launched by the Minister, Deputy Harney, on 16 June 2008.</P>
        <P>As regards other recommendations that relate to service provision, the expert advisory group is currently in discussion with the key service deliverers in primary and secondary care to progress an integrated model of care, paediatric services and retinopathy screening.  The expert <Col N="503"/>advisory group continues to meet on a monthly basis and localised meetings in the four areas are also being undertaken at present to raise awareness of the work of the expert advisory group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has not really answered the question.  The group has met and the report is completed, yet nothing is happening.  Is the Minister aware that diabetic eye disease is present in up to 50% of persons with type two diabetes by the time they present for diagnosis?</P>
        <P>Did the Minister see the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme during the week which detailed how a young girl has lost one eye as a consequence of diabetes?  The lack of screening of diabetes in this country &mdash; it is estimated to affect 250,000 people, 100,000 of whom do not know they have it &mdash; costs the State a fortune in terms of complications that arise because of a lack of action that would prevent complications of eye, renal and cardiac disease.</P>
        <P>If there was ever a case for preventing an illness or detecting it early, this is it.  The Minister will be aware I called for a national body test in the past but there was no mention in the programme for Government of age-appropriate annual check-ups.  Nothing has happened.</P>
        <P>Now we have another report compiled by a group of experts making recommendations but nothing has happened and it is being left on the shelf.  The funding which was there previously, put up by a drug company in Beaumont to initiate an excellent outpatient operation in conjunction with GP service, was withdrawn and the State would not take it over.  Will the Minister confirm when the expert advisory group&rsquo;s report that was completed in 2007 will be published and its recommendations implemented?  I am more interested in when its recommendations will be implemented than when it will be published.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister explain why the mobile retinopathy screening service in the north west has not been expanded, despite the fact that funding was set aside for its expansion in 2007 and 2008?  I cannot let this matter pass.  Additional money &mdash; &euro;750,000 &mdash; was given this year but it still has not been used.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of the allocation of funds for specific policy objectives that are highjacked by the HSE for its own ends.  This matter is important because it is the key to how things stand and it was not addressed by the Minister earlier &mdash; it got the Taoiseach so exercised recently that he threatened to silence the Opposition.  Will the Minister address this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Are there plans for a national diabetes screening programme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>We would like the retinopathy screening service in the north west to continue and our officials have contacted the HSE in this regard.  We hope to see progress in the near future.</P>
        <P>Regarding the report, the Deputy suggested nothing has happened but timing is important.  He referred to September 2007 but the report went to HSE management one month ago.  We are discussing what has happened in the past four weeks and we should get the timing right.  HSE management is considering the report and is doing its best to implement the recommendations it contains.  The clinical guidelines the Minister is to launch on 16 June, which I referred to in the reply, are of practical value for people because there has been agreement between GPs and consultants on who does what, when they do it and where.  This is important for patients presenting with diabetes and the continuum of care and clinical management was covered in the agreement for the guidelines.  The guidelines will be very good and may be used for other specialties because it is good that those involved know what each person will do, how it will be done and so on.  This is important for some of the clients referred to.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="504"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that the report was completed last September.  Is the Minister of State saying that is not the case or is she saying that, despite being completed last September, the HSE has only received it now?  Perhaps she will correct the record of the House for me.  I understood the report was completed last September.</P>
        <P>I agree it will be an excellent model of care but &ldquo;will&rdquo; is an unfortunate word.  When will it come into use?  We have known for some time about diabetes.  The issues around models of care have been tried in other countries and on a pilot basis in this country, but we are still waiting for yet another report.  This is like reinventing the wheel; the knowledge exists and the outcomes have been proven.  The basis for going ahead with a national programme for diabetic care under a chronic illness model is to be welcomed.  When will this happen and why are funds that were put aside in specific cases not being used?  As I asked the Minister earlier, what will the Government do about this situation in which its policy objectives can be usurped by the HSE?  For one reason or other budgets are not spent and are used for other purposes.  This is a serious question that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, should answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The money is used for services, drugs, medical cards and hospital care.  People are not putting the money in their pockets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that Government policy, as promised, is meaningless.  The bureaucrats in the HSE are left to determine how health policy is enacted and that is why we are in the mess in which we find ourselves.  Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster is out of control and its creator has walked away from it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The management of chronic illnesses, including diabetes, is a priority in the new contract with GPs.  The clinical guidelines will be launched on 16 June.</P>
        <P>Regarding the report&rsquo;s timeframe, it was not finalised in September 2007.  The first report of the diabetes expert group was drafted in October 2007.  On 17 December 2007 the expert group met HSE regional and sectoral representatives and decided a gap analysis report should be conducted.  That report was completed on 13 February and a summary document was then created.  The report did not reach HSE management until April 2008 and it has been there for the past few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the report be implemented?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I outlined the outcome of some of the elements relating to it.  The report has only been with HSE management for four weeks.  It is a very good report with many good recommendations and there are suggestions relating to models and standards of care and clinical guidelines that can be implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no timeline.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for selecting this matter for the Adjournment debate.  I want the record of the House to show that the Minister for Health and Children, who was present for Question Time, has left the House.  I thought she might at least show me the courtesy of staying to hear what I have to say.</P>
        <P>In August 2006 the Health Service Executive, HSE, announced its plans to transfer inpatient surgery from Roscommon County Hospital to Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe as an interim measure before its transfer to University College Hospital, Galway.  In September that year the now Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Michael Finneran, had the plan postponed until after the general election.  On the eve of the general election the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, told RTE on the steps of Roscommon County Hospital that the hospital would not be downgraded.  The plan was shelved until February this year when it was resubmitted to the hospital network manager of the HSE and on 28 April the green light was given by Ms Ann Doherty of the National Hospitals Office.  The decision was made to implement the transfer of inpatient surgery from Roscommon County Hospital to Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe.</P>
        <P>In April the HSE advertised for a consultant surgeon to fill Mr. Flynn&rsquo;s position in Portiuncula Hospital and three more posts for consultant surgeons will be advertised shortly.  The appointments will be made between now and the end of the year and, if they are lucky, they hope to make all the appointments for the posts already advertised.  Appointments will be <Col N="506"/>made of five general surgeons with no particular speciality.  The only appointment that needs to be made prior to the transfer of sources from Roscommon to Portiuncula is to fill Mr. Flynn&rsquo;s position.  Once that is done the HSE insists it can implement the transfer of surgery from Roscommon County Hospital to Portiuncula Hospital within 12 months.  The HSE was to give an outline of its plan to Roscommon County Council on 26 May but that meeting finished after less than an hour because the Government was to meet the National Hospitals Office on 28 May.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not understand why the second option, put forward by local consultants, has been rejected and why the HSE and the Government have not been prepared to outline their plans regarding the hospital.  The Government has not issued a statement on the future of the hospital because if the news were positive local representatives of the Government would trip over each other to claim credit.  It is important that the Government issues a statement as we do not want another agreement made behind closed doors.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, knows well what happened the last time.  We want a clear statement on the floor of this House regarding the plans for  inpatient surgery at Roscommon County Hospital.  It is important that the Government and the HSE stop hiding behind closed doors.  If the HSE and the Government are so confident that the downgrading plans are in the best interests of Roscommon County Hospital and the people who rely on it, why are they not prepared to talk to the media or engage in public debate either here in the House or at a meeting of Roscommon County Council?  The HSE claims it is not a cost-cutting exercise but the reality is different.  Not one additional bed will be provided in Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, which will see a doubling of inpatient surgery.  In fact, there will be a reduction in capacity of two beds at Portiuncula Hospital.  No additional day surgery will be carried out at Roscommon County Hospital and there will be no additional investment in the ambulance service in County Roscommon.  The next stage is the removal of the accident and emergency department, initially to Portiuncula Hospital and subsequently to University College Hospital, Galway, in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy as stated in the Hanly report.  This is already happening in Louth County Hospital; inpatient surgery was moved to Drogheda and now the accident and emergency department is to be transferred by the end of the year.  That is being used as the blueprint for the downgrading of services at Roscommon County Hospital, as categorically stated by the hospital network manager for the western region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is vital that we are given a clear and unambiguous statement on the future of inpatient surgery at Roscommon County Hospital, the retention of acute medical services and the accident and emergency department.  I ask the Minister of State to tell us whether the green light has now been given to the HSE to proceed with the transfer of inpatient surgery services from Roscommon to Portiuncula and when that decision was made.  Has the Government taken any action on this to date?  Why have no additional resources been put in place for emergency acute medical services in Roscommon?</P>

	<P>I will take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health services possible and to doing so effectively and efficiently.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance so that people can have confidence in the service and the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority was established on a statutory basis in 2007 and is responsible for driving quality and safety in the health and social care services.  In 2007 <Col N="507"/>a new Medical Practitioners Act &mdash; the first major overhaul in 30 years of the law regulating the medical profession &mdash; was enacted.  Also in 2007, the Minister for Health and Children established the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to develop proposals for a service-wide system of governance based on corporate accountability for the quality and safety of all health services.  In this context it is essential that every health care provider and facility is fully cognisant of patient safety and quality issues and takes account of these in the organisation, management and delivery of services.  The priority is to provide safe services as close as possible to where people live.</P>
        <P>The HSE has conducted a review of surgical and anaesthetic services at Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe.  The difficulties faced by Roscommon and Portiuncula in maintaining surgical services independently, and the need for closer co-operation between them, was highlighted by the former Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al in March 2006.  The best way of retaining and developing services at Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals is for both hospitals to work together.  In the past, these two hospitals operated independently, with two consultant general surgeons in each hospital.  Advances in clinical care and ever-increasing levels of specialisation mean this model of care is no longer sustainable.  Small stand-alone hospital services will not be able to offer their doctors the opportunity to treat a sufficient volume and variety of patients to maintain their skills.  Nor will they be able to provide the range of experience required for training new doctors.  As a result, it will prove increasingly difficult, and perhaps impossible, to fill consultant posts on a permanent basis.</P>
        <P>The development of joint departments of surgery and anaesthesia will provide a better service for patients of both hospitals.  The plan is to combine the staffing and workload of the existing small service units in Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital into joint departments of surgery and anaesthesia serving both hospitals.  This will involve joint consultant surgical and anaesthetic posts.  While the more complex surgical cases will be treated in Portiuncula, this represents only about three cases per week on average.  Roscommon Hospital will continue to provide surgical services for the rest of its patients.  It is likely that more Roscommon patients than heretofore will be able to have surgery performed at the hospital because most surgery can be carried out on a day basis, which is also more convenient for patients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to talk today about the Patton Flyer, which is the magic bus of the 21st century.  The Minister may be old enough to remember the song of that name released by The Who back in 1968.  It is an excellent bus service that carries passengers from Dalkey, Glasthule, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Monkstown to and from Dublin Airport.  The people of these areas want to see the service retained.  I put this in the context of the Department of Transport&rsquo;s development of a sustainable transport and travel action plan, one of the purposes of which is to encourage people to use buses more.  This bus serves areas that have no alternative bus or rail links to the airport.  It is a punctual, well operated service that is invaluable to residents.  I used the service on the one occasion I went to Dublin Airport in the past year, but many of my constituents use it on a regular basis, not just to catch flights but because they work at Dublin Airport and want to get there without driving.</P>
        <P>The bus uses the port tunnel and serves the county town of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which has no other service to the airport.  There is the Aircoach service that goes from Greystones to the airport via Bray, Shankill, Blackrock, Booterstown and Sandymount, but the Patton Flyer is the only service that connects Dalkey, Glasthule, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Monkstown with Dublin Airport.  Dublin Bus runs the 4A service, but this starts at Blackrock and goes to Harristown bus depot, which is adjacent to the main runway at the airport but is miles from the departure building.</P>
        <P>D&uacute;n Laoghaire has a population of 26,000, which is not far off the population of Leitrim at 29,000.  Imagine if we were to cut Leitrim off from all bus services.  The lack of services to D&uacute;n Laoghaire has the same effect of making it difficult for people to travel.  The problem here is the licensing procedure.  Operators must wait months for a licence to be issued and if it is refused they are in contravention of the legislation.  I note that the Department of Transport has referred the matter to the Garda for non-compliance with the legislation, and the matter now rests with the Garda.  It is a strange that a bus operator who provides a much-needed service is deemed to be operating illegally.  This is at a time when we are trying to encourage more people to use buses and public transport to achieve sustainable travel.  We are making it extremely difficult for people to provide these services even though they have taken a considerable business risk.</P>
        <P>I note that there is another private bus operator in the north Dublin area who had to wait two and a half years for a decision on a licence application.  The root cause of this is the outdated 1932 Road Transport Act under which licences are issued.  Under that Act, which dates from more than three quarters of a century ago, an operator can be fined the heady sum of &pound;50 for running an unlicensed service, plus &pound;5 per day for repeat offences.  This equates to &euro;7.50 per day.  This legislation must be modernised.</P>
        <P>I carry no brief for Dublin Bus, Aircoach or the Patton Flyer.  Today is not the time to argue about the merits of public and private bus services.  However, I do carry a mandate from the people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  They want a service to the airport that is efficient and reliable and that does the job.  Dublin Bus does a good job and has risen to the challenge of providing new routes in certain areas, but the private sector has provided some excellent new services and deserves support where it is innovative and responds to travellers&rsquo; needs.  Let us modernise the legislation, speed up the processing of applications and have a clear and transparent system.  Let us reform the antiquated legislation and continue to provide a necessary service via the Patton Flyer to the people of Dalkey, Glasthule, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Monkstown.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for proposing this Adjournment matter, which I take on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
        <P>The Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, provides the statutory basis for regulating the provision of public bus services by private bus operators.  In accordance with the legislation, private bus operators apply to the Department of Transport for licences to operate scheduled bus passenger services within the State.  Section 11 of the Act establishes specific criteria for the determination of applications, which provide that the service is required in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service, whether the service is sufficient in terms of frequency and duration to meet the requirements of the public and whether the applicant has the organisation and equipment necessary to carry out the service.</P>
        <P>There are no undue delays with the processing of either licence applications from private operators or notifications from State companies.  The Department turns around straightforward applications within a matter of weeks.  However, where there are prior applications for licences from other private operators or notifications from State companies, a decision on an application must be deferred until such time as the prior applications have been decided.  In these cases, while the preliminary work may have been completed on a particular application, a final decision cannot be made until other relevant applications or notifications received prior to it have been finalised.  In other cases, the application process can be delayed where relevant information is not provided by an applicant, such as an updated road passenger transport operator&rsquo;s licence, current public service vehicle licences and approvals from the Garda under the Road Traffic Acts for pick-up and-or set-down points.  All applications and notifications are assessed by the Department on receipt and decisions made as to whether they can be issued promptly or deferred for the reasons mentioned above.  Applicants are advised accordingly.</P>
        <P>On 20 February 2007, the Department received an application from the operator concerned for a licence to operate bus passenger services between Dalkey and Dublin Airport.  At that time, the Department advised the applicant that the application was being held until such time as a decision on a prior application for services on a similar route from another private operator had been determined.  The prior application has been finalised and the licence issued to Aircoach for the provision of bus passenger services between Greystones and Dublin Airport.  The licensed service also caters for passengers travelling from the areas of Bray and Blackrock and is meeting the needs of passengers by providing an express service via the port tunnel to Dublin Airport.</P>

	<P>The Department understands from the licence holder that the service has been introduced and the frequency shall be increased in the coming months.</P>
        <P>On 16 July 2007, the Department was made aware that the operator concerned had commenced the operation of an unlicensed bus passenger service between Dalkey and Dublin Airport.  The Department immediately contacted the company and advised that failure to cease the operation of a service in respect of which a licence had not been issued under the Road Transport Act 1932 is an offence under section 7 of that Act.  It is also a prerequisite to the <Col N="510"/>issuing of a licence that, in accordance with road traffic legislation and safety, the applicant provides the Department with Garda approvals for all proposed bus stops along the route.  No bus stop approvals have been received by the Department for any of the stops being utilised on the service in question.  As the unauthorised service continued to operate, the Department advised the company that the matter was being passed to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its investigation.  This matter is currently the subject of an ongoing Garda investigation.  I assure the Deputy that I will raise the matter of transport in D&uacute;n Laoghaire with the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter relates to an April 2007 incident of phenol-contaminated drinking water in five group schemes in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  It was discovered following complaints by consumers of private water supply schemes about a bad taste and odour.  The water was contaminated with phenol by an aluminium chloride product that, according to a HSE report, &ldquo;was not recommended for use in the treatment of drinking water and was suitable only for waste water treatment&rdquo;.  Of the nine group schemes to which such a product was supplied, five were found to have been contaminated.</P>
        <P>I welcome the HSE&rsquo;s findings.  As phenol is unpalatable at low levels, the HSE found that consumption of water in harmful quantities was unlikely.  I commend the work of the HSE and Cavan and Monaghan county councils in response to the incident and in drafting their reports.  Cavan County Council pointed out that, had it not been for the unpalatable nature of the phenol, &ldquo;the health of a large number of consumers could have been compromised&rdquo;.  The HSE and the councils found that the water was unfit for human consumption.</P>
        <P>This type of incident could recur, although the contaminant might not be as unpalatable as phenol &mdash; even phenol carries health risks.  There could be a detrimental impact on human health.  According to the HSE, greater priority must be given to protection of the consumer.  We must ensure that we avoid such incidents in future and that the local authorities and the HSE are empowered and armed to deal with them as efficiently as possible.  Much work has been done in respect of private group water schemes under the design, build and operation programme, but safeguards must be put in place.  The schemes are private and, while they are monitored by local authorities, there is no Government oversight.</P>
        <P>Much work has been invested in the reports, a number of the recommendations in which require Government action, particularly by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Legislation must be introduced and the councils and the HSE must be properly staffed and resourced if we are to ensure good quality drinking water.  The HSE recommends that a national agency, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, should be empowered to actively oversee the management of chemical incidents, particularly where more than one local authority is involved.  This would require Government action.  Monaghan County Council recommends that the EU drinking water regulations be amended to require the immediate notification of the supervising authorities and-or the HSE by contractors or operators of water schemes in the event of a water quality incident that could affect human health.  Both councils identified a problem in assessing suitably accredited laboratories in Ireland and the UK to appropriately test samples.  Cavan County Council recommends that there be a central laboratory.  All the reports identify and highlight the need for stronger standards regarding the procurement and use of chemicals intended for use in the treatment of drinking water.  There are also the difficulties presented by the staff recruitment embargo imposed by the Government.  That was highlighted in the Monaghan County Council report which recom<Col N="511"/>mended a review of staffing levels to determine what additional resources are needed by local authority water services departments to deal with their day to day duties as well as with this type of incident.  All reports identify the need for stronger powers to seize and retain evidence.</P>
        <P>The report from Monaghan County Council pointed out that the exact nature and cause of the coagulant contamination remain to be established.  The Government must monitor this.  It is important that the report&rsquo;s recommendations are acted upon by the Minister and his Department.  There are lessons to be learned from the work carried out by the three authorities concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, or the Minister of State meet the HSE and the two county councils?  Will action be taken to bring in the necessary legislation?  Will the water services departments gain more staff?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Tuffy for raising this on the Adjournment.  I am pleased to be able to update the House regarding developments in this case.</P>
        <P>Separate investigations into this incident, which involved five group water scheme supplies, serving about 1,700 households in Cavan and Monaghan, have been carried out by the respective county councils and by the Health Service Executive.  The reports have just become available and were published by all three bodies last Friday.  These reports are comprehensive and outline the background to the incident and the actions taken by each of the parties thereafter.  They highlight issues identified by the investigations and include a number of recommendations.</P>
        <P>The contamination of these supplies came to light over the period 30 March to 5 April 2007 when consumers registered complaints about taste and odour in their drinking water.  The schemes were part of a collection of ten treatment plants in Cavan and Monaghan that serve 3,500 households.  The source of the problem has been identified as a contaminated batch of poly aluminium chloride, a coagulant used in the water treatment process, which was supplied to the contractor operating the affected treatment plants.</P>
        <P>When the problem was identified, the coagulant was immediately replaced by the contractor through a new supplier, and, as a precautionary measure, was replaced across all ten schemes in the project bundle.  A &ldquo;Do Not Use&rdquo; notice, under Section 9 of the Drinking Water Regulations 2007, was issued on 19 April 2007 to all affected group water scheme users by Cavan and Monaghan County Councils, in consultation with the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>An incident management team which included representatives of all interested parties was set up immediately and remained in place until the warning notice was withdrawn.  During this period arrangements were made to provide householders in all the affected schemes with an alternative supply of drinking water.</P>
        <P>This was a regrettable incident that caused great worry and inconvenience to all consumers concerned.  On a positive note, it is clear that the public authorities responsible quickly took charge of the situation and, with the co-operation of the contractor, identified the problem, made alternative arrangements to get drinking water to consumers and ensured that the treatment plants were brought back into operation as quickly as possible.  I note also that the HSE report has confirmed that the threat to human health was minimised by the low odour and the taste threshold of the phenol contaminant.  The expert advice is that the water would have been too unpalatable for consumption to have reached harmful levels.</P>
        <P>The HSE has also confirmed that no symptoms or illnesses relating to drinking water were reported and that media reports of mouth irritation and nausea were not noted by or presented to HSE staff.  Neither were unusual patterns of illness or symptoms reported by general practitioners in any of the affected areas.</P><Col N="512"/>
        <P>In Ireland there are more than 6,500 public and group water scheme supplies and incidents of this kind are very rare.  Nevertheless, all possible measures must be taken to prevent a recurrence.  The local authority and HSE reports are being examined in my Department and the recommendations will be given early and careful consideration to ensure that all steps required will be taken to guarantee safe and secure water supplies.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Finneran for taking the Adjournment debate.  I would obviously prefer to have the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, in the House to address the matter.</P>
        <P>For almost a year, I have been asking the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to take command of a major investigation and process of remediation and compensation for residential and infrastructural projects which have been badly damaged by defective infill materials with too high a concentration of the mineral pyrite.  A few weeks after the Government came to office, I first learned of the distress of householders in the Drynam Hall estate in Kinsealy where floors, walls and ceilings were cracking.  A circular on the problem had been sent around by the Drynam Hall developers, Mennolly Homes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A few months later I was informed that the problem also existed in The Coast and Clongriffin developments in the huge new north-fringe urban region in my constituency.  Other reports located the pyrite problem in the vast Castlecurragh estate in west Dublin and indicated that a significant number of developers had contacted the suppliers, Homebond, regarding their fears about the matter.  Lately, I have heard allegations from the construction industry that at least 60,000 residential units built during 2001-2002 may be infected by the disastrous pyrite infill.  Equally alarmingly, there are continuing allegations that a number of large infrastructural developments, including urban regeneration projects, are contaminated by pyrites.</P>
        <P>Pyrites is an iron sulphide popularly known as &ldquo;fool&rsquo;s gold&rdquo;. It reacts with oxygen and water to form sulphuric acid and expands with devastating consequences for buildings if exposed to air or water.</P>
        <P>This unfolding crisis is exacerbated by the serious downturn in the construction industry. In the middle of it all stands the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, who has washed his hands of any responsibility for the disaster.  It was his Department, however, that permitted complete self-regulation of building standards in the construction industry.  In earlier replies the Minister has referred me to a pathetic circular on building standards which he sent out to the local authorities last autumn.  It requests them to implement the Building Control Act 1990 and consult the National Standards Authority of Ireland amendment to SR 21 on building aggregates.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has shirked his responsibility to thousands of householders, perhaps tens of thousands, who have entered negative equity by his failure to act.  In more general terms, he has failed the State because of possible damage to very costly infrastructural developments.</P>
        <P>Why has the Minister not yet ordered a full traceability audit of the 2 million tonnes or so of infill from the affected quarry owned by the Irish Asphalt division of the Lagan Group?  Only 100,000 tonnes, or 5%, of this aggregate has been accounted for so far, in terms of location.  Is the Minister terrified of the possible results of a thorough investigation of the Lagan Group&rsquo;s operations at this quarry?  Can he confirm if the quarry is still open?  Why has he not directed Fingal County Manager, Mr. David O&rsquo;Connor, to close the facility immediately?  Why has the Minister not ordered a thorough investigation of the other quarries in Leinster that are <Col N="513"/>also allegedly damaged by high pyrite concentrations?  Why has he not examined the wider operations of the Lagan Group and similar suppliers of quarry concentrates?</P>
        <P>Young householders were left to fend for themselves while a company called Killoe Developments failed to respond to their desperate anxieties about their mortgage investments.  Why did the Minister stand helplessly on the sidelines?</P>
     
        <P>The pyrites infill disaster is not the first infill calamity of its kind in the world.  The Minister might have followed the example of the Mennolly Homes developers and looked to the experience of the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec with regard to this problem.  Yet the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has consistently refused to establish a national pyrite investigation and monitoring agency along the lines of the Quebecois example or even to issue an information document for the benefit of homeowners and consumers such as the Canadian document &ldquo;Pyrite and Your Home&rdquo;.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Why will the Minister, Deputy Gormley, not immediately implement a protocol for compulsory chemical analysis of all construction infill?  Why has the Minister not asked the Taoiseach and the Cabinet to consider appropriate compensation mechanisms for affected householders and public bodies?  Even at this late stage, will the Minister call on the Dublin City Manager, Mr. John Tierney, and Fingal County Manager, Mr. David O&rsquo;Connor, and establish a task force to investigate and address all aspects of this appalling affair?  Is the Minister, Deputy Gormley, aware that UK media outlets are inquiring if the Lagan Group is considering off-loading and selling quarries in the State and in the North?  The Irish media is running scared of this important story.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister, Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s response to this shocking development during the construction boom of the Celtic tiger is completely unacceptable and must change immediately.  I am deeply disappointed that a Green Party colleague from the first rainbow coalition on Dublin City Council, which I led, should be so lethargic and uncaring to perhaps tens of thousands of our fellow citizens unwittingly caught up in this disaster.  If the full dimensions of the pyrites infill problem turn out to be as feared and alleged by sources in the construction sector, the Minister, Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s days in the Department are surely numbered and the local authorities and the State will be left with a possible liability of tens of billions of euro.</P>

	<P>I take this matter, which was discussed on several previous occasions, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.</P>
        <P>The difficulties being experienced by homeowners whose homes have been affected by the use of pyrite in certain developments in and around County Dublin are fully recognised.  However, the resolution of problems arising between building owners, including owners of public buildings, as well as home owners and the builders are matters for resolution between the parties concerned, namely, the building owner, the relevant developer and the builder&rsquo;s insurer.  Where the construction of a building is the subject of a contract between the client and the builder, enforcement is a civil matter.</P>
        <P>I wish to report on certain developments and actions since the matter of pyrite was first raised.  As a first step, Fingal County Council, the building control authority for the area, made direct contact with the developers and the quarry concerned regarding problems encountered following the use of pyrite as an under-floor infill material in certain developments.</P>
        <P>Having consulted the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body, the Department issued a circular letter, BC 6/2007, to each county manager and local building control authority on 16 August 2007 to bring the issue of pyrite to their notice and to request co-operation in the <Col N="514"/>enforcement of the relevant requirements set out therein.  The circular also brought to their attention a notice issued by Fingal County Council on 26 July 2007 on this matter.</P>
        <P>The certification of products is the responsibility of the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.  When the issue of pyrite arose and following an intervention from the Department, the National Standards Authority of Ireland moved to reconvene its aggregates panel to give urgent consideration to the matter.  The Department is represented on this panel, together with representatives and stakeholders of the construction industry.</P>
        <P>Following a public consultation process, the NSAI has now published a new amended standard recommendation on the use of aggregates as infill for civil engineering and road construction work.  The new standard recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and the intention is that it will address the quality standards of new homes and buildings in so far as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.  My Department will adopt this NSAI standard recommendation in the relevant technical guidance document associated with the building regulations.  The NSAI has notified the EU Commission of this intention in accordance with statutory requirements and EU approval is currently awaited to the proposal.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 46 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>The HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.</P>
        <P>A new National Surveillance System has recently been established by the HSE to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis on four key areas, to monitor HCAIs in our health system:</P><Col N="516"/>
<P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />Staphylococcus bacteraemia (blood stream infections);</P>
<P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />Antibiotic consumption;</P>
<P el="5">3. <Miles com="ix" />Alcohol gel use;</P>
<P el="5">4. <Miles com="ix" />MRSA Surveillance in Intensive Care Units, from 2008 onwards.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This data (excluding MRSA in ICUs) has been compiled and published for 2006 and 2007.  The report represents a significant step forward in terms of providing essential data that will serve as a benchmark for assessing progress in the future.  I firmly believe that you cannot manage what you don&rsquo;t measure. We have now with this system begun a very useful measurement process.</P>
        <P>The results so far show some improvement in 2007 over 2006.  The overall S. Aureus bloodstream infection rate was lower in 2007 (0.36) compared to 2006 (0.37).  The overall proportion of MRSA was also lower in 2007 (39.4%) compared to 2006 (42.4%).  The overall acute in-patient antibiotic consumption rate is marginally up in 2007 over the 2006 rate by 2.4%. The overall alcohol gel use is up by a significant 50%.  This data has many limitations that does not allow for direct comparison between hospitals.  Also, areas like the antibiotic prescribing are calculated on a bed-days usage basis and is affected by the different procedures and data collection and processing systems applied in hospitals.  However, the results are soundly based and will provide a good benchmark to enable us to measure the progress of each hospital.  From now on, this data will be available on a quarterly basis.</P>
        <P>In March 2008, the Chief Medical Officer of my Department instructed the HSE to make C. difficile a notifiable disease and since May 4th all cases are required to be notified to the relevant Department of Public Health.</P>
        <P>Since 2006, over 30 new staff in posts of Senior Pharmacists, Senior Infection Control Nurses and Surveillance Scientists have been appointed specifically to enhance infection control.  I have instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used for isolation purposes where required for patients who contract HCAIs.  New environmental building guidelines to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments are expected to be published by the HSE later this month.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertook a comprehensive review of hygiene in our acute hospitals in 2007 and published its report last November.  The report represents a thorough assessment of how hygiene services are provided and managed in 51 HSE-funded acute care hospitals.  This allows individual hospitals identify strengths and areas for improvement.  HIQA is following up on this review to ensure that deficits identified during that process are rectified and the Authority will be undertaking a further national review this Autumn.  In addition, this week HIQA published draft Infection Prevention and Control Standards for public consultation.  When finalised, these, along with the National Hygiene Standards, will provide a comprehensive framework to control infection in all healthcare settings.</P>
        <P>While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of recent issues which have arisen regarding the &ldquo;Hospital in the Home&rdquo; service. </P>
        <P>One of the key challenges facing the health service is the need to ensure that services are planned and provided in line with the clinical needs of the patient. A number of experimental initiatives have been put in place by the Health Service Executive with a view to providing care in community based rather than hospital based settings where clinically appropriate.  The &ldquo;Hospital in the Home&rdquo; service is one such initiative along with the introduction of Primary Care Teams, Community Intervention Teams, a Rapid Access Service for the Elderly and the GP Out of Hours service.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;Hospital in the Home&rdquo; service was delivered by a private service provider on the basis of a service level agreement with the HSE and was for a period of one year. This agreement came to an end on the 16th March and was extended by agreement until 11th May 2008.  During the year, the service treated in the region of 2,000 patients at an annual cost of &euro;6.83 million.</P>
        <P>A review of the service was carried out between January and March of this year under an independent Chairperson.  The review made a number of recommendations.  The main recommendation, which has been adopted by the HSE, is that the concept of the &ldquo;Hospital in the Home&rdquo; be retained and that the service should be repatriated within existing HSE services.</P>
        <P>The HSE is considering the manner in which it can best mainstream the service, previously offered by the service provider, into the Executive.  In this context, the HSE is developing the range of services provided by the Community Intervention Teams in the Greater Dublin Area and extending their coverage with a view to meeting the needs of patients previously treated by the &ldquo;Hospital in the Home&rdquo; service.</P>
        <P>The HSE has emphasised that no patient will be disadvantaged by this decision and has advised that patients who had been receiving services from the provider in question when the contract ceased have been contacted by the HSE to reassure them that their treatment would continue until it was scheduled to finish. There will be no interruption to their care.</P>
        <P>I have agreed to meet, later this month, with representatives from the company which had been providing this service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 43 together.</P>
        <P>My priority is to provide safe services as close as possible to where people live.</P>
        <P>The best way of retaining and developing services at Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals is for both hospitals to work together.</P><Col N="518"/>
        <P>In the past, these two hospitals operated independently with two consultant general surgeons in each hospital. Advances in clinical care and ever-increasing levels of specialisation mean this model of care is no longer sustainable.</P>
        <P>Small stand-alone hospital services will not be able to offer their doctors the opportunity to treat a sufficient volume and variety of patients to maintain their skills. Nor will they be able to provide the range of experience required for training new doctors. As a result, it will prove increasingly difficult, and perhaps impossible, to fill consultant posts on a permanent basis.</P>
        <P>The difficulties faced by Roscommon and Portiuncula in maintaining surgical services independently, and the need for closer co-operation between them, was highlighted by the former Comhairle na nOispideal in March 2006.</P>
        <P>The development of joint departments of surgery and anaesthesia will provide a better service for patients of both hospitals. While the more complex surgical cases would be treated in Portiuncula, this represents on average only about 3 cases per week. Roscommon Hospital will continue to provide surgical services for the balance of its patients. Indeed, it is likely that more Roscommon patients than heretofore will be able to have surgery performed at the hospital because most surgery can be carried out on a day basis, which is also more convenient for patients.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 27 together.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Health Service Executive that there has been no cessation in the response to self-harm presentations in Cavan/Monaghan.</P>
        <P>Indeed, a range of liaison mental health services are provided by Cavan/Monaghan mental health services to the Cavan/Monaghan general hospital.  Medical and nursing liaison is provided through home based treatment teams that provide a rapid response to presentations of acute psychiatric illness, including those involving self-harm. In addition, in February 2006, two clinical nurse specialists were appointed to the role of alcohol liaison between Cavan/Monaghan mental health services and Cavan/Monaghan general hospitals.  This was in recognition of the established link between self-harm and alcohol.  These nurses have screened 1,500 presentations to date and have engaged with more than 400 patients and their families.</P>
        <P>The overall liaison services with Cavan/Monaghan general hospitals and therapeutic services are being reviewed and the role of deliberate self-harm nurse will be examined in that context.   The purpose of this review is to ensure that these services are consistent and needs-led. The National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) will be consulted as part of the review process.  In addition, the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork is currently considering best <Col N="519"/>practice in the area of deliberate self-harm services in order to standardise the approach to service delivery.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 16 together.</P>
        <P>Overall spending on mental health services in 2007 amounted to &euro;1 billion. This included some, but not all, of the additional &euro;51m funding which was provided by the Government in Budgets 2006 and 2007 to support implementation of &ldquo;A Vision for Change</P>
        <P>In 2007, overall spending by the HSE on palliative care services amounted to &euro;75m. Again, this included some, but not all, of the additional &euro;18m funding which was provided by the Government in Budgets 2006 and 2007.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised me that it was unable to use the remaining funding for mental health and palliative care services as planned because it had to cover higher than anticipated costs in other parts of its services, particularly in acute hospitals, within its overall budget allocation.</P>
        <P>Clearly, the HSE has to operate within the resources available to it in any year. However, this should not mean that new funding provided by the Government for specific service enhancements is redirected to other purposes. Accordingly, we need to focus on improving the management of existing services and associated funding. In particular, making better use of existing capacity within acute hospitals and managing hospital activity on a planned basis would deliver better hospital services and, at the same time, allow primary and community services to be improved in line with the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy.</P>
        <P>My primary concern at this stage in relation to mental health and palliative care services is to improve the services provided to clients and patients. My Department has, therefore, asked the HSE to submit proposals for enhancing these services within its existing overall resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In a response to a perceived shortage in various therapy occupations, a report, entitled the Current and Future Supply and <Col N="520"/>Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Health Professional Therapists (the Bacon Report) was commissioned in 2000.  It was published in early 2001.</P>
        <P>The Bacon Report recommended an expansion of physiotherapy undergraduate course places from 120 to 145. My Department has been actively involved in implementing that recommendation and the number of Physiotherapy undergraduate course places now stands at 152.  The actual intake of students year on year fluctuates from 145 to 152 due to students repeating the year among other things. Funding of &euro;2.0m has been provided to support the clinical education of the newly established training places in Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy and Speech and Language Therapy. This investment is currently being rolled out through a national working group.</P>
        <P>Since the establishment of the HSE in January 2005, there has been a 20% increase in the number of physiotherapists employed in the public health sector. Many physiotherapists also operate in a private setting and some graduates will find employment in that capacity.</P>
        <P>My Department has been working with the HSE and representatives of the profession to pro-actively address the situation where some physiotherapy graduates have had difficulty in obtaining employment.</P>
        <P>There are a number of contributing factors to the employment situation. I have always made it clear that the HSE must live within the funds provided by Government. The budgetary overrun last year had an impact on recruitment which affected physiotherapy posts along with other areas. In addition, the therapy professions, including physiotherapists, have a disproportionate amount of senior grades with fewer opportunities for employment of graduate therapists at staff grade level. This mainly stems from the way in which services have developed.  There has been a tendency for new development posts especially in the community to be pitched at senior grade. I appreciate that clinicians are anxious to ensure that staff have an appropriate level of experience and supervision. I believe however that it is critical that everyone involved in health care delivery takes a flexible and innovative approach to delivering and implementing new services and to ensuring the best skill mix is in place.</P>
        <P>A recruitment process has been organised in 2008 for staff grade therapists in Physiotherapy. The aim of this recruitment process is to ensure that panels of therapists are available to take up positions as they become available. The Physiotherapy panels are in place since the end of March.</P>

        <Quest> if the Health Service Executive in its present form is capable of delivering a comprehensive health service to the people here in the foreseeable future notwithstanding the dramatically increased costs to the taxpayer, the employment of an extra 30,000 staff and the commissioning of numerous reports; if a cost benefit analysis has been undertaken to compare today&rsquo;s costs and delivery of service with those of the health boards; her views on whether the term centre of excellence should apply to all hospitals and institutions operated by the HSE with a view to delivery of the highest quality service to the growing population in a manner equal to that available in other EU countries; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive is capable of delivering a comprehensive health service.  It is essential that the Executive concentrates on delivering safe, cost-effective services from within its existing very substantial resource <Col N="521"/>base.  The services and targets to be provided by the HSE in 2008 are set out in the national service plan, which I approved in November 2007 and the addendum to the service plan which I approved in February 2008.  Both of these documents have been laid before the Houses and published.</P>
        <P>The Annual Output statement demonstrates that substantial progress has been made in the delivery of health services.  Only by continuing to push forward with and supporting an agenda of reform within the health services can we deliver the kind of health service we all want to benefit from within the resources that are available to us.</P>
        <P>The gross provision for the Health Service Executive in 2008 is &euro;14,337 million revenue and &euro;594 million capital.  The challenge is to transform this investment into tangible benefits for patients and staff so as to deliver the world class health service that everyone wants and that this level of investment warrants.  The issue of cost benefit analysis in the context referred to by the Deputy does not arise.  We are striving to improve the value for money element of this investment, developing a system that provides real incentive for good performance by the HSE itself and by its service providers.</P>
        <P>The Government and I are working with the HSE to develop the appropriate staffing levels for the job that is to be done, in front line services as well as in administration.  In the period December 2004 to March 2008, direct frontline service staff, in both the HSE National Hospitals area and Primary and Community Care have increased by about 10% while HSE Corporate staff levels have been reduced by more that 10%.</P>
        <P>Reports and consultancies commissioned by the Executive are a matter for the Executive and it&rsquo;s Board.  The level of reports commissioned is not unreasonable given the size and complexity of the organisation and the breadth of the reform programme being undertaken.</P>
        <P>Centres of excellence or specialist centres should and will apply to all hospitals and institutions operated by the Health Service Executive. The reform agenda has to be supported by structural change in the health system, as well as by improved management actions and changed work practices in providing services to patients.  This change is happening on a number of fronts such as the first full modernisation in 30 years in the Medical Council and the regulation of doctors and the modernisation of the law regulating the pharmacy profession and health and social care professions with the putting in place of a fundamental new contract for consultants for the first time in 30 years.  The establishment of HIQA and setting standards progressively that will be monitored and implemented is also a crucial development in achieving excellence in health care settings.</P>

	<P>The Government decision in May 2006 approved the development of a new national forensic mental health facility at Thornton Hall, Co. Dublin.  The new hospital facility will provide a therapeutic, forensic psychiatric service to the highest international standards, in a state-of&ndash;the-art building.  The decision to relocate the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) is consistent with &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; &mdash; the report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, which recommends that <Col N="522"/>the CMH should be replaced or remodelled to allow it to provide care and treatment in a modern, up-to-date humane setting and that capacity should be maximised.</P>
        <P>The redevelopment of the CMH will constitute a separate capital development project independent of the prison complex to replace Mountjoy Prison, and will be owned and managed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The new hospital will be built on its own campus and will retain its identity as a distinct therapeutic health facility with a separate entrance and address to the prison complex.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances there are no proposals to revisit the Government Decision of May 2006.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 40 together.</P>
        <P>The key objective of the Primary Care Strategy is to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, home helps and others.  It is clear that the membership of primary care teams and networks are drawn from existing professional and other staff working in primary, continuing and community care services, and that there would also be a major enhancement of the level and nature of services available in those settings.</P>
        <P>There have been substantial enhancements in the services provided in primary and community care setting along with corresponding increases in the numbers of staff concerned.</P>
        <P>At this stage, the main focus needs to be on the reorganisation of existing services and staff into primary care teams and networks.  This requires changes in work practices and reporting relationships, with an emphasis on joint working by various health professionals. It also requires significant work in mapping and profiling of areas.</P>
        <P>Work under many of these headings is well advanced and I am pleased with the level of interest in, and engagement with, primary care teams among general practitioners. I understand that some 500 GPs are involved in the development of teams, with a further 700 projected to become involved.</P>
        <P>Specific additional funding was provided in 2006/2008 to facilitate the roll-out of extra primary care teams. Some of this funding was used to appoint extra frontline professional staff.</P>
        <P>I have emphasised to the HSE the importance I attach to the continued development and roll-out of primary care teams.</P>

	<P>The HSE and HSE funded agencies provide rehabilitative training for persons with disabilities to enhance their individual level of skill which will assist in accessing future employment at varying levels. The HSE employ Guidance Officers at local level to assist in the profiling of young school leavers with disabilities to appropriate training and day services.  The Guidance Officers work with the school leaver, their family, school authorities and service providers to ensure that school leavers with disabilities have access to appropriate services.</P>
        <P>The increase in services in recent years has ensured that young people with Intellectual Disabilities and Autism have appropriate services in place, to ensure a smooth transition from secondary school. In some cases, the funding provided supported the school leavers to access appropriate day services, in line with a person centred plan.  In many cases, this funding provided places for individuals completing rehabilitative training, thereby creating training places for other school leavers. The HSE  and HSE funded agencies also provide a range of other day services, designed to meet the needs of adults with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The Multi-Annual Investment Programme for Disability Services makes provision for the development of additional day, residential and respite places each year between 2006 and 2009 for people with Intellectual Disability and Autism.  &euro;50m was provided to the HSE in budget 2008 for additional services to people with disabilities including additional day places.</P>
        <P>At this time the HSE is still in discussion with the Department of Health and Children regarding the commencement of 2008 developments in the context of the overall financial position of the HSE.  The HSE is therefore not in a position to approve the commencement of these developments until these discussions are concluded.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of the Home Help service is to enable older people to remain at home in their own homes for as long as possible.  It is a critical support to older people in facilitating their early discharge from hospital or in preventing inappropriate admission to acute hospital and long-stay residential care. </P>
        <P>There have been major improvements in the Home Help service in recent years. At the end of 2007, about 53,000 people were receiving Home Help services. Over 11.75 million Home Help hours were provided during 2007, compared to 9.1 million hours in 2005. At the end of the first quarter of 2008, a total of just over 3 million Home-Help hours has been provided by the HSE, which is 1.7% over target for that quarter.  Given the level of demand for the service, <Col N="524"/>and the increasing number and dependency of older people in the community, the focus has to be to ensure that Home-Helps are targeted at those who are most in need.</P>
        <P>This service is, by its nature, flexible, in order to respond to clients&rsquo; needs. The level of service required in individual cases will fluctuate from time to time, and will be affected by factors such as respite care, input by family members and admission to or discharge from hospital. Service provision may be increased as appropriate to meet individual needs.  To ensure effective prioritisation of the service, assessments are undertaken at local level and are delivered to clients in accordance with individual circumstances and available resources.</P>
        <P>While there are no existing national guidelines, the HSE are at present undertaking a variety of measures to encourage the professionalisation of the Home-Help service nationally. These include implementation of the Home-Help Agreement that has been reached to reflect the valuable partnership role of the voluntary sector in different areas of the country. In addition, the Executive is developing standards for Home-Care provision which would include guidelines for Home-Helps, to support service provision at local level. If the Deputy is aware of any particular case involving difficulties, due to changed circumstances, I would be happy to pursue this with the HSE.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Task Force on Sudden Cardiac Death was published in March, 2006. It makes recommendations on the prevention of sudden cardiac death and on the detection of those at high risk. The issue of systematic assessment of those engaged in sport and exercise was considered by the Task Force and a number of recommendations were made, although none specifically call for ECG screening of children, young people or adults. The Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for implementing these recommendations and has made progress is consultation with GPs, Cardiologists, the Irish Sports Council and a number of sporting organisations. Where funding for risk assessment schemes is requested, the HSE may consider such applications, taking into account the recommendations of the Task Force.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 77 together.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas has voted a budget for the HSE for 2008 from resources provided by taxpayers. This allocation is an increase of 8% on the 2007 outturn of the HSE. Allowing for various once-off factors, the underlying increase amounts to 9%.  By any standard, national or international, that is a high level of increase for a national health service.  Few other countries maintain such levels of increases year after year.  The OECD reported recently that our rate of increase in public health spending has been second highest in the developed world in the ten years between 1995 and 2005.</P>
        <P>There is no health system in the world that operates without implicit or explicit budget limits and benefit limits.  It is also the case that every health system, including our own, needs to deliver the most effective services for given resources and to constantly improve, that is, to make value for money and efficiency gains.</P>
        <P>The HSE has incorporated Value for Money targets within its service plan.  Those who support increased efficiency in public services will fully understand and support the fact that a 1% increase in efficiency for the HSE means, in financial terms, providing the same level of services at a cost of &euro;142m less; a 2% efficiency gain means providing the same level of services at a cost of &euro;280m less.</P>
        <P>The services and targets to be provided by the HSE in 2008 are set out in the National Service Plan which I approved in November, 2007 and the Addendum to the Service Plan which I approved in February, 2008.  Both of these documents have been laid before this House and published.</P>
        <P>In its Exchequer Issues return to end May the HSE is reporting an overspend against profile of &euro;59m, excluding the long-stay repayments scheme.  Based on current trends, the HSE anticipate a budgeting challenge in the order of &euro;300m this year. My Department and I have had discussions with the HSE about these emerging budget pressures.  The imperative for efficiency gains and more effective practices is all the greater in order to deliver services, consistent with Government priorities, and within the annual budget allocated by the Oireachtas and the profile of expenditure planned for each month.  The HSE is now considering the steps it should take in this regard.</P>

        <Quest> her views on whether a culture of acceptance of trolley waits in hospital accident and emergency departments exists; when she expects hospitals to meet the maximum target trolley waits as set out in the ED Task Force Report; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22225/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree that a culture of acceptance of trolley waits exists. There have been considerable improvements in the delivery of services in Emergency Departments over the past two years, largely as a consequence of the intensive focus which has been put on this area.  One indicator of improvement is the reduction in the average daily number of patients awaiting admission from 179 in 2005 to 92 in 2007.</P>
        <P>While I acknowledge that there was an increase in the numbers during the early part of 2008, the numbers have since reduced. The average daily number of patients waiting for admission from Emergency Departments in May reduced to 87. However, I fully accept that we need to continue these improvements, particularly in terms of reducing waiting times. I believe that it is important to set clear targets for improvement and to measure performance accordingly.  In <Col N="526"/>line with this approach, the HSE has introduced a target waiting time of no more than 12 hours from decision to admit patients attending Emergency Departments.</P>
        <P>Difficulties are largely confined to a number of major hospitals and the HSE is working closely with these hospitals to bring about further improvements.  One of the particular challenges facing the HSE is the need to address bottlenecks in both the admission and discharge process.  Among the initiatives being taken is the need to ensure that patients have an expected date of discharge within 24 hours of admission and that patients can be discharged in a more proactive manner at weekends. Implementation of a new Code of Practice on Discharge Planning is to commence next month in a number of hospitals, including the Mater, Beaumont, St. James&rsquo;s and Tallaght.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to building on the progress made over the last two years in improving services in Emergency Departments. We will support initiatives which are designed to improve access for patients and allow for more timely admissions and discharges. The objective is to move towards a lower target of 6 hours waiting from decision to admit in line with the recommendation of the Task Force report.</P>

	<P>As part of the Multi-Annual Investment Programme 2006-2009 under the Disability Strategy, the Government provided the Health Service Executive with an additional &euro;75m in both 2006 and 2007.

        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.

	<P>There has been considerable expansion in treatment services under the National Drug Treatment Strategy 2001-2008 and, while improvements are still required in treatment services for drug users, I am satisfied that considerable progress has been made in improving both access and the range of services available. In regard to funding, the HSE currently makes &euro;91 million available for its drugs services overall: this includes an additional &euro;6 million which was allocated for key priorities in Budget 2007. Under the 2001-2008 Strategy the following developments have taken place.  Just over 2,300 methadone treatment places have been created since the beginning of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. Over the same time period there has been an increase in the total number of patients receiving methadone substitution treatment each year, with the number rising from 7107 in 2001 to 9756 in 2007, a rise of 37%. The number of clinic outlets increased from 62 to 66 and the number of outpatient services have increased by 25%.  The number of GPs partici<Col N="528"/>pating in the methadone treatment scheme increased from 195 to 255.  The number of pharmacies participating increased from 268 to 470.</P>
        <P>The involvement of GPs and pharmacists facilitates the delivery of services in a patient centred way in local communities.  The HSE is continuing its efforts to involve more GPs and pharmacists, particularly outside the greater Dublin area. The HSE also provides harm reduction and outreach services as does the voluntary sector: it is acknowledged that there is need to increase the availability of harm reduction services.</P>
        <P>In recent times the HSE has been re-orienting its addiction services to address the needs arising from changing patterns of drug use in the population e.g. poly drug use including cocaine use, alcohol use and abuse of prescribed drugs.  Available evidence indicates that many approaches already in use in general addiction services work well with cocaine misusers.  These approaches are not specific to the treatment of a cocaine using group and are effective for problem use of other substances.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s addiction service prioritises under 18 year olds. As resources permit, the HSE is implementing the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on Treatment for Under 18 year Olds Presenting to Treatment Services with Serious Drug Problems.  This includes the establishment of multi-disciplinary teams.</P>

In Ireland, anyone who is eligible for healthcare (all those who are ordinarily resident as well as EU nationals employed in Ireland) may be issued with an EHIC by the HSE.</P>
        <P>Anyone who already has either a medical card or a Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS) card may apply online at www.ehic.ie.  Applications may also be made at Local Health Offices in person or by post. Cards are issued within approximately 10 working days.  If there is not sufficient time before travelling for an EHIC to be issued, a Provisional Replacement Certificate may be issued at your Local Health Office. This is a paper form that gives the same entitlement as the EHIC, but usually for a shorter period.</P>
        <P>Where an EHIC is lost or stolen, a replacement EHIC may be issued. Applications for a replacement EHIC may only be made through Local Health Offices and may not be made online. The replacement EHIC will be forwarded to the applicant within ten days. Where a replacement is needed more urgently than this, a Provisional Replacement Certificate may be issued.</P>

	<P>National public information and awareness campaigns on drugs are undertaken by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  In planning the public awareness campaign for 2008 it was decided that the focus would be Cocaine.  The aim of the Campaign is to dispel the myths around Cocaine and Cocaine use.  It was seen as imperative that this Campaign would ensure that all National, Regional and Local Stakeholders, would be connected into the National Campaign. The composition of the Campaign Advisory Group established by the HSE was aimed at facilitating this.</P>
        <P>Specific funding of &euro;500,000 is also being provided through the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to the Regional and Local Drugs Task Forces for local campaigns to link into the National Awareness Campaign.  The Social Marketing function of the HSE Population Health Directorate is working with the National Advisory Committee on Drugs to support the roll-out of these local Campaigns.</P>
        <P>It is important to note from a social marketing perspective that the most successful information and awareness campaigns are driven by measurable objectives informed by analysis of the target audience, and guided by proven theories and models of behaviour change and that they should be implemented with creativity. Strengthening the links between National and Local Public Awareness Campaigns on Drugs should assist in this process and bring benefits for all those involved.</P>

	<P>In the context of his most recent Budget Speech, the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Cowen, T.D., announced an Efficiency Review, under which all Departments were required to examine all administrative spending under their, or their State bodies&rsquo;, aegis. The identification of inefficiencies arising from the multiplicity of Boards and Agencies was identified as relevant in this context. The recent OECD Review of the Irish Public Service (&ldquo;Towards an Integrated Public Service&rdquo;) also raises a number of issues around the structure and governance of agencies. Accordingly, my Department has been considering the position of agencies within its aegis.</P>
        <P>Agencies (other than the HSE and HIQA) falling within my Department&rsquo;s aegis have functions ranging across advice, programme implementation and regulation. They are predominantly small in terms of organisational size and expenditure, and a number are self-funding. A comprehensive independent review of health organisations (Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System) was published in 2003. Considerable rationalisation has already taken place under the 2004 and 2007 Health Acts, and other changes are already planned, as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The National Cancer Screening Service Board and the National Cancer Registry are to be subsumed into the HSE as part of the Cancer Control Programme;</P><Col N="530"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The National Council for the Ageing and older People is to be mainstreamed into the newly established Office for Older People;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, provides for the dissolution of the Post Graduate Medical &amp; Dental Board and the streamlining of the Board&rsquo;s functions to the HSE, Medical/Dental Councils, as appropriate;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the functions of the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery are to be subsumed by An Bord Altranais and the HSE once the proposed new Nursing and Midwifery Bill is passed; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the National Social Work Qualification Board is due to be streamlined into the National Council for Health and Social Care Professions in the next year or so.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The potential for further streamlining and/or rationalisation is being considered in the context of the Efficiency Review referred to above, and  will also arise in the context of our response to the OECD Review.</P>
        <P>Efficiencies are already being implemented by agencies within the health sector in the areas of procurement, business processes, and outsourcing. Additional benefits might also accrue from sharing of functions such as payroll, finance, ICT, pensions, legal services, and HR, and my Department is considering how the necessary co-ordination might be applied to allow such possibilities to be exploited.</P>

	<P>A Strategic Review of Neurology services in Ireland has been undertaken by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The Review was overseen by a multidisciplinary Steering Group whose aim was to identify the current level of service provision and future requirements for neurology and neurophysiology services in Ireland. The specific objectives were to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Describe the epidemiology of neurological conditions in Ireland.</P>

The cost of the additional beds is to be met from within the HSE&rsquo;s total financial allocation in respect of long-term residential care services for older people, including the additional &euro;110 million provided for the Fair Deal. </P>
        <P>The &euro;110 million was provided for the specific purpose of the Fair Deal. Any redirection of the funding would have to be considered within the context of the HSE&rsquo;s overall financial position this year and in 2009, particularly its ability to fund the full year cost of the Fair Deal in 2009, and having regard to other competing service priorities.</P>

	<P>The new contract for medical consultants provides for the following contract types:Type A: Will work exclusively for the public hospital and will be remunerated solely by way of salary. Type B: Will work exclusively for the public hospital but may engage in limited  private practice on the public hospital campus (including in a co-located hospital) up to a maximum of 20% of total clinical throughput. Type C: To be created only in exceptional circumstances where there is a demonstrable benefit to the public health system.  Such a consultant will be entitled to treat private patients outside the public hospital campus. </P>
        <P>In addition, as a special transitional arrangement, a Type B contract will be available to existing Category II Consultants and Category I Consultants in Emergency Medicine.  This will permit them to engage in private practice in facilities operated by the employer or in co-located private hospitals on the public hospital campus. Consultants holding this type of contract may also engage in private practice in locations outside the public hospital campus subject to them signing up to all the other terms and conditions of the new contract.</P>
        <P>Other key features of the agreement include:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The working week will be 37 hours;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An extended working day (8am &ndash; 8pm), Monday to Friday;</P><Col N="532"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Consultants may be required to work up to 5 hours structured overtime on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays to expand access for patients/clients to consultant provided services;</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Consultants will work in teams to deliver consultant-provided rather than consultant-led services to patients.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Access to outpatient diagnostic services will be based solely on medical need.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These arrangements will result in the increased availability of senior clinical decision makers to treat and discharge patients as part of the transition to a consultant-delivered service from the present consultant-led service.</P>
        <P>The target date for the implementation of the new contractual arrangements is 1 September 2008.</P>
        <P>In April 2008 the HSE recommenced the recruitment process for new consultants in a range of specialties. In excess of 120 posts were advertised with the prior agreement of both the IHCA and IMO.</P>
        <P>My Department is engaged in discussions with the HSE in relation to the development of a plan for the recruitment of several hundred new medical consultants over the medium term, and for a reduction in the number of non-consultant hospital doctors employed in the public health system, as part of the transition to a consultant-delivered service.</P>

	<P>&rsquo;Reach Out&rsquo; &mdash; A National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, which was launched in September 2005 provides a policy framework for suicide prevention activities in Ireland.  The strategy calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies. </P>
        <P>&rsquo;Reach Out&rsquo; recognises the importance of reaching out to people who work in places and settings that can be isolated and a key component of the strategy is the implementation of measures aimed at high risk groups and vulnerable people.  These include the provision of information and training on suicide prevention to relevant professionals and organisations, research on suicide prevention and the improvement of services which would benefit those at risk of suicide and those who attempt suicide. Implementation of the strategy is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.</P>

	<P>The National Disability Strategy, which was launched in September 2004, provides for a framework of new supports for people with disabilities.  The Strategy builds on a strong equality framework, which is reflected in several pieces of equality legislation. The main elements of the Strategy include: </P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Disability Act 2005;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act (EPSEN) 2004;</P>

       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Citizens Information Act 2007, and</P><Col N="536"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A Multiannual Investment Package, amounting to &euro;900 million over the years 2006 to 2009.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Disability Act 2005 remains the central component of the National Disability Strategy. While the legislation was sponsored by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children, together with the HSE, are charged with specific statutory duties, most notably concerning the implementation of Part 2 of the Act.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, intervention early in life can have a significant impact on the disabling effects of a condition or impairment. In recognition of this, Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 was commenced for children aged under 5 years with effect from 1 June 2007. This provides parents of young children with disabilities an entitlement to an independent assessment of their child&rsquo;s health and education needs and a statement of the services which it is proposed to provide for them. To date over 1,800 applications for an assessment of need have been received and are being processed by the HSE.</P>
        <P>Representatives of the Department of Health &amp; Children, the Department of Education &amp; Science, the Health Service Executive and the National Council for Special Education meet on a regular basis to address a range of issues, including matters arising in relation to the ongoing implementation of the Disability Act 2005. This work includes planning for the roll out of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, in tandem with the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 (EPSEN Act). This legislation, which is the responsibility of the Department of Education &amp; Science, provides for the provision of education services for people with disabilities. The Department of Education &amp; Science has informed my Department that it is envisaged that all sections of the EPSEN Act 2004 will be implemented over a five year timeframe, with the assessment process as provided for in the EPSEN Act 2004 due to commence in 2010.</P>
        <P>The statutory requirements of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 will be extended to adults as soon as possible, but no later than 2011.</P>
        <P>The recently-established Office for Disability and Mental Health will focus in particular on facilitating the delivery of integrated health and education support services for children with special needs, by further developing these existing mechanisms for co-operation and co-ordination between the health and education sectors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 60 together.</P>
        <P>I would like to assure the Deputies that tackling Health care Associated Infections (HCAIs), including Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), continues to be a priority for the Government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>The recommendations referred to by the Deputies are contained in the Guidelines for the Surveillance, Management and Control of C. difficile-associated disease which were published on 22nd May by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  They give national guidance and deal with the isolation of C. difficile ribotype 027 for the first time in Irish hospitals.  They will be a valuable resource in assisting in the prevention, management and control of this infectious disease.  The HSE is considering the report at present to decide on its implementation and I have asked to be kept informed of progress on this matter.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group, chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in health care settings, and, in addition, will focus on reducing antibiotic use in Ireland.  The Steering Group <Col N="538"/>is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.</P>
        <P>C. difficile was not, up to now, a notifiable disease and, as a result, it was difficult to quantify the extent of infection in the health care system.  However, it was examined in the Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) in acute hospitals in 2006.  The survey found that thirty-six patients had C. difficile representing 0.5% of patients studied.   In March 2008, the Chief Medical Officer of my Department instructed the HSE to make C. difficile a notifiable disease and since May 4 all cases are required to be notified to the relevant Department of Public Health.  The number of cases reported to date is within the range identified in the 2006 Survey.  The HSE will continue to monitor the data closely.</P>
        <P>While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

        <Quest> her plans to reconfigure the delivery of hospital services in the north east; if it is true there is not a red cent available to build a new tertiary hospital in the region; the interim plans to deliver hospital services to the people of the north east; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Transformation Programme for the North East region involves widespread and fundamental change and is designed to build a health system that is in line with the model of care emerging internationally.   The international evidence indicates that this can be achieved by centralising acute and complex care so that clinical skill levels can be safeguarded through ensuring sufficient throughput of cases.  This was highlighted in the Teamwork Report &mdash; &ldquo;Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards &mdash; An Action Plan for Health Services in the North East&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Transformation Programme is about the reshaping and integration of community and hospital services so individual members of the public will have access to better quality safe services, which they can have confidence in.  The majority of that care can be provided locally where practical, including within the community or in the home.</P>
        <P>In progressing the Programme the Health Service Executive (HSE) has repeatedly emphasised its commitment that existing services in the region will remain in place until they are replaced with higher quality, safer or more appropriate services.  The overriding aim of the Programme, which I fully support, is the need to improve safety and achieve better standards of care for patients in the region.</P>
        <P>The report of the consultancy firm, which the HSE commissioned to carry out an independent study on a possible location for the new Regional Hospital was noted at the HSE Board meeting in April.  No decisions have been made by the Government or by the HSE on the future location of the new hospital.</P>
        <P>The findings of the recently published OECD Report &ldquo;Ireland Towards an Integrated Public Service&rdquo; will need to be carefully considered in the context of the Transformation Programme for the North East. The Report emphasises the need to deal with the reforms of primary and community care in tandem with the reconfiguration of hospitals if the overall vision is to be realised.  It suggests a broader examination of international systems which would help identify how other countries have met the needs of areas with characteristics similar to the North East.</P><Col N="539"/>
        <P>The OECD took the view that an examination could include the possibility of having two hospitals, one regional and one general, in the North East.   It added that the outcome of such an examination could equally be a reaffirmation of the plan for one acute hospital for the region.</P>
        <P>The immediate focus of the Transformation Programme is to have acute and complex care moved from 5 to 2 hospital sites and to ensure that services in the region are organised to optimise patient safety.  The first step in the development of a fully integrated regional health service is to ensure that the people of the North East have local access to both routine planned care and immediate life saving emergency care.  Over the next few years, in preparation for all acute emergency in-patient care and complex planned care being provided at a regional centre, the existing five hospitals will continue to improve services by further merger of their acute care specialties.</P>
        <P>The reconfiguration of services in the North East in a way which demonstrably delivers safer and more effective services for people in that region will continue to have my full support.</P>

	<P>The Emergency Department Task Force Report was commissioned by the Health Service Executive and published in June 2007.  The Report set out a series of  recommendations for action to improve service delivery and included  a particular emphasis on the introduction of waiting time targets for patients attending emergency departments.  The report also described a range of initiatives which would enable hospitals to comply with these targets.</P>
        <P>I do not accept that overcrowding in Emergency Departments has reached record levels. There have been considerable improvements in the delivery of service in accident and emergency departments in the last two years. One indicator of improvement is the reduction in the average daily number of patients awaiting admission from 179 in 2005 to 92 in 2007.</P>
        <P>The national daily average number of patients awaiting admission in  May (to 30th) was 87, a reduction on the figure of 97 for the same period in May 2007.   The average daily number of patients waiting in excess of 24 hours was 3, compared with 7 for the same period in May 2007.  The average daily number of patients waiting between 12 and 24 hours for admission was 27 compared with 26 in 2007.</P>
        <P>Significant additional resources have been provided  to address the problems which manifest in Emergency Departments.  Among the developments which have taken place in line with the recommendations of the Task Force Report are:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />additional public and private Long Stay Beds,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />additional Home Care Packages and Home Help Hours,</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />rapid assessment clinics to support the catchment population of the Mater hospital,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />expansion of the GP out of hours services in North Dublin.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In terms of waiting times, a revised target of 12 hours waiting from decision to admit was introduced in October 2007.  This built on an initial maximum target waiting time of 24 hours. The HSE is also committed to monitoring and reporting on the total length of time patients spend in Emergency Departments, whether they are admitted or not. A number of hospitals have commenced reporting this information and the HSE expects to be in a position to publish data on up to 18 hospitals in the next few months. The majority of  hospitals are meeting their admission targets and problems are largely confined to a small number of hospitals.  The HSE is working closely with those hospitals with a particular focus on improving and streamlining  processes and patient pathways to ensure that care is provided in a more timely, appropriate and efficient manner. Targeted initiatives include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />setting up consultant led Clinical Decision Units and Acute Short Stay Units with a dedicated number of beds,</P><Col N="541"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />integrated discharge planning implemented on a 7 day basis, including nurse facilitated discharges,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />updating the bed management system and processes with a focus on improved discharge planning,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />implementation of a new Code of Practice on Discharge Planning is to commence in June 2008 in a number of Hospitals, including the Mater, Beaumont, St. James&rsquo;s and Tallaght,</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reducing inappropriate referrals from GPs to Emergency Departments,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reducing admissions with the duty medical registrar deciding on admissions,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />standardising assessment processes,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />enhancing diagnostic capacity.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The initiatives which I have described are designed to free up capacity during 2008, to allow for more timely admissions from Emergency Departments and further movement towards a lower target of 6 hours waiting from decision to admit in line with the recommendation of the Task Force report.</P>

	<P>I identified the need to improve services for persons with cystic fibrosis as a priority in the Estimates process over recent years.  Since 2006, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.78m has been allocated to the HSE to develop services for patients with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that 44 additional staff dealing with cystic fibrosis have been appointed to date across a number of hospitals, including St Vincent&rsquo;s, Beaumont, Temple Street, <Col N="542"/>Crumlin, Tallaght, Cork University Hospital, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  The necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.</P>
        <P>I asked the HSE to place a particular focus on the development of services at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, the National Adult Tertiary Centre for the treatment of persons with cystic fibrosis, where concerns had been raised regarding the need to improve facilities.  A number of capital projects have been completed at the hospital and further developments are in progress.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, a new ward block is to be built at St. Vincent&rsquo;s which will include 120 replacement beds in single en-suite accommodation.  The new facility will accommodate cystic fibrosis patients and will include appropriate isolation facilities.  The HSE advises that planning permission has been obtained, financial provision has been included in the HSE Capital Plan and the contract is to be awarded in 2008.  It will be a condition of the contract that the design build period be no more than 24 months from the date of contract award.</P>
        <P>In the interim, work is under way on the refurbishment of accommodation to provide eight single en-suite rooms for patients with cystic fibrosis.  The HSE expects that these beds will be operational from the end of July.  On completion of this first phase, work will commence to further increase the number of single rooms for patients with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>Beaumont Hospital operates as a regional centre in providing services to adults with cystic fibrosis.  In the 2008 Budget, &euro;2.5m capital funding was provided to enable Beaumont Hospital to provide out patient facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.  Following discussions between hospital management, consultant respiratory physicians and cystic fibrosis patient representative organisations a decision has been taken regarding the site for a purpose built out-patient facility for patients with cystic fibrosis.  A detailed proposal in relation to the development is being prepared for submission to the National Hospitals Office for approval.  My Department understands that patients with cystic fibrosis will also benefit from additional single room capacity in the new medical admissions unit at the hospital which is due to open in December.</P>
        <P>The Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive has been asked by my Department to revert to the Deputy on the operational issue raised.</P>

	<P>The Recommendations contained in the Report mentioned by the Deputy are broadly consistent with the recommendations contained in the reports by the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol (STFA) which guide and inform my Department&rsquo;s alcohol policy.</P>
        <P>In order to tackle alcohol related harm, the Government is taking a twin-track approach, involving, on the one hand, policies and interventions targeted at vulnerable populations and, on the other, policies targeted at the population at large to reduce the overall level of alcohol misuse in society.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has announced changes in the licensing laws with a view to reducing public disorder.  I will shortly be launching further restrictions on alcohol advertising, marketing and sponsorship.  In addition, my Department is <Col N="543"/>to establish a Working Group to consider issues around sport sponsorships by alcohol companies.</P>
        <P>At an operational level the Health Service Executive (HSE) is working closely with the Gaelic Athletic Association in relation to the Alcohol and Substance Abuse Programme (ASAP).  The aim of the ASAP is to reduce the harm that is being caused by the misuse of alcohol and drugs.  The ASAP Programme intends to achieve this aim by developing a structure of people throughout the association with specific roles at club, county and provincial levels.  The HSE has developed guidelines in relation to alcohol and drugs for the Community Games organisation and is also assisting the Football Association of Ireland in developing a drugs and alcohol policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware the subvention scheme is being replaced by an improved system of nursing home support, A Fair Deal.  My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, and I are anxious for the support scheme to come into operation as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In January 2007 the rate of basic subvention was increased substantially, to &euro;300 per week.  This means that many more people should be eligible for subvention than in the past.  Also, additional funding was made available for both subvention and enhanced subvention last year.  The amount of enhanced subvention paid is at the discretion of the HSE and varies according to the cost of care.  Individuals who are in receipt of a subvention may apply for a review if their nursing home increases its fees.  I am aware of the situation regarding nursing home charges and the current rates of subvention and I am actively considering this matter at present.</P>

	<P>The National Disability Strategy was launched by Government in 2004 and underpins the participation of people with disabilities in Irish society by building on existing policy and legislation.  The Strategy comprises five elements:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Disability Act 2005;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004;</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Citizen&rsquo;s Information Act 2007; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A Multi-Annual Investment Programme for disability support services of &euro;900m for the period 2006-2009.</P><Col N="544"/>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">Part 2 of the Disability Act provides people with disabilities with an entitlement to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />an independent assessment of their health and education needs</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a statement of the services it is proposed to provide</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />pursue a complaint through the HSE complaints process if necessary</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Part 2 of the Act commenced for children aged under 5 years with effect from 1st June 2007.  Children under 5 years were chosen as the priority for the introduction of the assessment of need process under the Disability Act  because of the importance of intervention early in life.  This can have a significant impact on the disabling effects of a condition or impairment.</P>
        <P>The commencement of Part 2 in respect of children aged between 5 and 18 will be introduced by 2010, in parallel with the implantation of the EPSEN Act 2004.  The statutory requirements of Part 2 of the Disability Act will be extended to adults as soon as possible but no later than 2011.  The HSE has also appointed Assessment Officers and Liaison Officers in each LHO area.  The Assessment Officer is responsible for the co-ordination of the Assessment Report, while the Liaison Officer has responsibility for the provision of the service statement.  At the end of March 2008, 1,836 applications for assessment of need have been received and are being processed by the HSE.</P>
        <P>The Health Sectoral Plan sets out the actions which the Department of Health and Children, the HSE and 27 statutory bodies will take to meet their obligations under the Disability Act 2005.  It represents a commitment at all levels of the health service to access and equity of service for people with disabilities.  In December 2007, the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive published the first of three annual reviews of progress on the Sectoral Plan.  Further targets have been identified, specifically in relation to planning for the commencement of the Act for 5-18 year olds and adults.  This includes work with the Health Services Executive, the Department of Education and Science and the National Council for Special Education and other relevant stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The Multi-Annual Investment Programme 2006 -2009 was announced as part of the Budget Day package in December 2004.  It outlined the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a programme of revenue and capital expenditure, amounting in total to around &euro;900m, on specific disability support services over that period.  The bulk of this funding is being spent in the health services.</P>
        <P>A key development which will assist in progressing the National Disability Strategy was the Government&rsquo;s decision in January of this year to establish the Office for Disability and Mental Health.  This Office will assist me in exercising my responsibilities across four Government Departments: Health &amp; Children, Education &amp; Science, Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment and Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform.  The new Office brings together responsibility for a range of different policy areas and State services which directly impact on the lives of people with a disability.  The Office will aim to bring about improvements in the manner in which services respond to the needs of people with disabilities by working to develop person-centred services, focussing on the holistic needs of clients and service users and actively involving them in their own care.</P>
        <P>The social partnership agreement Towards 2016 outlines our vision for people with disabilities, the Programme for Government supports the implementation of the National Dis<Col N="545"/>ability Strategy.  This Government will work with the social partners to achieve continued improvements in the quality of life of people with disabilities.  The ultimate aim is to provide people with a disability an opportunity to live a full life and to participate in society.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have previously made it clear that I want to see appropriate staffing structures in place throughout our public health service.  This includes management structures and front line service delivery.  My main aim in relation to management structures is to ensure clarity of roles, responsibilities and reporting relationships in order to improve the overall governance and management of our health services.</P>
        <P>The board and management of the HSE have been considering possible improvements in their existing management structures which would optimise their operational or service delivery capacity.  These proposals are still being finalised and will be considered by me in the near future.  Separately, the HSE has commissioned a review of its administrative staffing.  I understand this review indicates that the HSE is not over-resourced in clerical, administrative and managerial staff compared to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  Between December 2004 and March 2008 direct frontline service staff in both the HSE National Hospitals area and Primary and Community Care have increased by approx. 10% while HSE Corporate staff levels have been reduced by more than 10%.</P>
        <P>I believe that a properly planned and managed voluntary redundancy scheme could have an important role to play in helping to streamline management within the HSE and, as a result, in improving the delivery of health services to patients.  Such a scheme would need to be built upon a clearly delineated organisation structure and the associated human resource requirements.  It would also need to demonstrate that it will deliver value for money, having regard to other options such as natural wastage and the scope for re-deployment.</P>
        <P>Discussions about a possible redundancy scheme are still at an exploratory stage.  In accordance with established practice in the public service, any such scheme would operate on a voluntary basis and would require the approval of the Minister for Finance.  There would also need to be discussions with the relevant staff associations.  Clearly, it is an option that requires further work but it is also one which could help to deliver significant benefits in terms of a much streamlined and integrated management structure within the HSE.</P>

	<P>The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has undertaken a scientific assessment of the public health value of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine following a request from my Department.  NIAC and <Col N="546"/>the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) agreed that this work needed to be complemented by a study of the cost effectiveness of the vaccine in the current Irish context.  Accordingly, both organisations requested the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a study into the cost effectiveness of HPV vaccine.</P>
        <P>HIQA has now completed the study and NIAC and NCSS were requested to evaluate the HIQA report.  The Chief Medical Officer of my Department has received correspondence from the Chairman of NIAC setting out the NIAC&rsquo;s evaluation of the HIQA report and I have recently received a response from the NCSS.</P>
        <P>I will consider all of the advice now available to me to ensure that a policy decision is taken which is coherent as between the introduction of HPV vaccine and the planned national roll out of the cervical screening service, which reflects a fully integrated approach to this problem and which is based on the best national and international evidence available to us.  I intend to make a decision this summer.</P>

	<P>The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) will shortly implement a quality assured national population based screening programme, so that preventable deaths from cervical cancer among women can be avoided.  The NCSS has announced a preferred bidder for the provision of laboratory testing services for the National Cervical Screening Programme.  This is an important milestone which will enable the NCSS to launch the first quality assured, population based National Cervical Screening Programme for women in Ireland aged 25-60 years.</P>
        <P>The Faculty of Pathology, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) has a responsibility for postgraduate medical education and training of pathologists in Ireland.  The NCSS met with the Faculty and agreed to a collaborative working relationship in order to identify solutions to <Col N="547"/>issues raised in relation to proposed provision of cytology services in laboratories abroad.  The RCPI supports the implementation of the National Cervical Screening Programme and the goal of reducing waiting times for smear test results.</P>
        <P>The HSE has undertaken a review of its laboratory medicine services.  I welcome steps that are being taken by certain HSE funded laboratories to secure accreditation.  I believe that if all those involved work together in partnership there is scope to provide high quality and cost effective services within HSE funded laboratories.  The National Hospitals Office (NHO) of the HSE has a commitment to its staff currently employed in cytology services, and has met with their representative.  Any decisions regarding reassignment of employees will be addressed after the National Cancer Screening Service has completed the procurement process for cytology services.</P>

        <P>The Health Service Executive has commissioned a number of reviews of the configuration of acute hospital services including those referred to by the Deputies. In each case, the first priority is patient safety. The challenge in the years ahead will be to organise, manage and deliver high quality services that are focused in the first instance on the safety of patients.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has commissioned Horwath Consultants in association with Teamwork Management Services to work on the strategic reviews of acute hospital services being undertaken by the Executive in the Mid West and Southern regions. The reviews focus on identifying the best configuration of acute hospital services in these regions including arrangements for A&amp;E, critical care, acute medicine and surgery, together with diagnostic services so that the highest quality of care can be delivered to the population of the regions concerned. The Health Service Executive reviews will act as one of the inputs to decisions on how best to reconfigure acute services in the regions concerned. The Government and the Executive are committed to ensuring that the approach to re-organisation of services is carried out in consultation with the key stakeholders, and that each element is progressed incrementally. I believe that it is important to work with health professionals and other interested parties to secure an increasing set of improvements over time. This approach will, I am confident, produce the best outcome for patients.</P>

	<P>A core function of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is to set standards on safety and quality of health services and to monitor enforcement of those standards in an open and transparent way.  The Health Act 2007 currently gives HIQA strong powers in this area in relation to services provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and bodies funded by the HSE to provide services on their behalf.  The process by which such a regulatory regime is introduced first in the public sector is a feature of similar developments in other jurisdictions.  The extension of this type of monitoring and control to the private sector involves further legislation of a complex nature.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance was established last year to develop proposals for a health service wide system of governance based on corporate accountability for the quality and safety of all health services.  One of its terms of reference is to specifically examine and make recommendations in relation to a statutory system of licensing for public and private health care providers and services.  The Commission is due to report by the end of July this year.  There is already in existence extensive legislation governing the activities of healthcare professionals which includes those operating in the private sector.  I will consider what additional appropriate regulatory framework should be applied to public and private healthcare providers and services when I receive the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance.</P>

        <Quest> his views on setting a ceiling on the <Col N="552"/>price of diesel fuel after which no extra Government excise duty would be imposed in order to alleviate the problems being encountered by individuals and companies who, because of the recent increases in the cost of fuel, are unable to recoup this cost increase from their customers; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The increase in fuel prices generally, and the increase in the price of diesel, is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty, supply disruptions and strong economic growth in countries such as China.  Excise duty rates in Ireland for both auto-diesel and petrol are &euro;368.05 and &euro;442.68 per 1,000 litres of fuel respectively. These rates are lower than the EU 15 average, and our main trading partners particularly our nearest neighbour, the UK.  I would also like to point out that excise rates for both diesel and petrol have not been increased in the last four Budgets.</P>
        <P>The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>In relation to the rate of VAT applicable to auto-diesel, the position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Auto-diesel is subject to the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%. It would not be possible to reduce the VAT rate applicable to auto-diesel without reducing the rate for all goods and services subject to the standard VAT rate. A decrease of 1 percentage point in the standard VAT rate would cost the Exchequer &euro;483 million per annum. Such a reduction would have little or no impact on the price of fuel.  It should also be noted that the VAT content of purchases of auto-diesel, kerosene, marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) and fuel oil used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the impact high oil prices can have on growth rates, the Informal ECOFIN in September 2005 discussed the issue of an appropriate policy response to the then price increases.  The Ministers agreed that distortionary fiscal and other policy interventions that prevent the necessary adjustments should be avoided. This continues to be the appropriate policy response, as was confirmed during an exchange of views on the subject at the most recent ECOFIN meeting earlier this week.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the Health Repayment Scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.  The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care including contract beds in private homes. Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.</P><Col N="556"/>
        <P>The HSE has advised my Department that a very high number of deficiencies have appeared on claim forms which must each be rectified before they can be processed.  The Scheme Administrator has taken a proactive role in addressing this issue. In many cases, the Scheme Administrator contacted the claimant to explain the deficiency on the form. This is particularly effective where either a letter has been sent seeking additional information and a response has not been received or where the deficiency is complicated. As a result of this proactive approach there are now less than 800 claim forms with deficiencies.</P>
        <P>The HSE has indicated that the Scheme Administrator has not requested any claimant to withdraw an appeal unless they have submitted an appeal form and then subsequently contacted the Scheme Administrator to inform them that they changed their mind. Where this occurs and the claimant contacts the Scheme Administrator to inform them that they now wish to accept the offer then, in that instance, they will be told that the repayment cannot be processed until the appeal is withdrawn.</P>

	<P>Persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services qualify for a medical card, which entitles them to a range of health services free of charge.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>In general, eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings). The main exception is persons aged 70 and over, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card. The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

        <P FLI="0">Nevertheless, it is important to note that the methodology under which employment figures are compiled changed during the course of 2007 with the addition of personnel not previously included in subsumed agencies such as the Health Service Executive-EA (HSEA), the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (GMSPB), Health Boards Executive (HeBe) and the Office for Health Management (now part of the HR function) together with many other posts in projects or posts previously excluded such as Health Research Board funded posts, PPARS and Value-for-Money posts (all of which are largely in the Management/Administrative stream) together with the inclusion of student nurses and chaplains. This change was undertaken to represent health service employment on a like-for-like basis with employment ceilings and to more accurately represent a reconfigured health service&rsquo;s employment information.

        <P FLI="0">In interpreting this information, it is necessary to take account of the fact that a substantial programme of work has been undertaken in recent years to improve data quality in the General Medical Services (GMS) client database.  For example, in 2003 and 2004, work carried out by the health boards led to a deletion of approximately 104,000 inappropriate entries, where, for example, there were duplicate entries for the same person, the expiry date on the card had passed, the person had moved away or was deceased.  This exercise did not involve any reduction in the actual number of persons who held medical cards but rather resulted in a more accurate picture of the number of individuals in receipt of GP services under the GMS Scheme.</P>

These discussions commenced in the week beginning 5 May 2008, and are ongoing. With goodwill on all sides I am hopeful that these discussions can bring about an agreed resolution on these issues in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Following the withdrawal of injunction applications by the HSE against individual pharmacists for threatened breach of contract, both sides agreed that there will be no disruption of pharmacy services pending the completion of the work of the Independent Pricing Body &mdash; chaired by  Mr. Sean Dorgan.  In addition, a process of mediation requested by the High (Commercial) Court is due to begin on 5 June next under the chairmanship of Mr. Eoin McCullough S.C.</P>

	<P>It is important to note that the transfer of services from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to new facilities at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital is not due to take place for a number of years.  In the meantime, two additional linear accelerators were commissioned at St. Luke&rsquo;s earlier this year and two replacement linear accelerators will be commissioned later this year.  These will provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.</P>
        <P>The decision to transfer services from St. Luke&rsquo;s was taken by the Government in the context of its consideration of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology Services.  The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology is integrated with all other aspects of cancer care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology.</P>
        <P>No decisions have yet been taken in relation to the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke&rsquo;s.  However, I am anxious to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interest of the health services.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to provide an additional 1,500 public acute hospital beds. About 1,000 of these will be provided through the co-location  initiative and the balance through the HSE&rsquo;s capital plan.  The co-location initiative aims to make available additional acute beds for public patients through the transfer of private activity from  public hospitals to colocated private hospitals.</P>
        <P>Co-location was seen as the quickest and least expensive means of providing significant additional capacity for public patients. No capital outlay was required as the beds in the public hospitals were already in place, having been funded by the Exchequer.

	<P>In December 2004, the Department of Health and Children, through the Health Research Board, approved expenditure of  &euro;5 million on autism research to help improve international understanding of the genetic causes of autism. This &euro;5 million is the Irish contribution to a new major international research initiative called the Autism Genome Project which  will receive a total investment of &euro;12 million from a variety of international organisations over the next three years. The other co-funders in the international consortium include Autism Speaks (US), the British Medical Research Council (MRC), Genome Canada and Partners, Canadian Institutes <Col N="566"/>for Health Research (CIHR), Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center (SARRC), and the Hilibrand Foundation. This unique combination of international, public and private partners funding a consortium of clinicians and scientists is a new and welcome departure in the field of autism research.</P>
        <P>The Health Research Board has informed my Department that this funding was awarded as follows:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;2.8 million: Professor Michael Gill, Department of Psychiatry, Trinity College, Dublin</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;2.2 million: Professor Andrew Green, Director National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin (affiliated to UCD).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This figure represents the largest tranche of funding to be awarded by any of the four funders within the international consortium. The Irish researchers are at the forefront in unravelling the genetic determinants of autism and related disorders. They are using novel state-of-the-art genetic sequencing technology to analyse DNA samples taken from autistic patients to identify candidate genetic markers for autism. They will collaborate with their international colleagues to then link these genetic markers with clinical outcomes. This unique international research effort will greatly improve not only our understanding of the causes of autism, but its diagnosis and treatment.</P>
        <P>The remaining issues in the Deputy&rsquo;s question are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services qualify for a medical card, which entitles them to a range of health services free of charge.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>In general, eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings). The main exception is persons aged 70 and over, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card. The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 to 117, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In February 2008 I launched a public consultation process on a proposed Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan.  The cost of advertisements in the printed media amounted to &euro;155,974.  The consultation process ended on 13 May 2008.</P>
        <P>Recent market research undertaken on behalf of my Department indicated that awareness levels of Transport 21 among the general public are low. Therefore, as part of a wider information and communications strategy and following a public procurement process, my Department engaged the services of consultants to undertake a media advertising campaign to raise public awareness of Transport 21.</P>
        <P>The campaign involves television, radio, press and outdoor advertising and I envisage that it will be necessary to continue to provide information and awareness to the public and all interested parties for the duration of Transport 21.  The budget allocated for the advertising campaign for 2008 is &euro;2.9 million. To date, &euro;244,345.50 of this has been paid by the Department. The consultants have been engaged for a three-year period and further campaigns are planned <Col N="568"/>for 2009 and 2010.  The overall objective of the campaign is to make the general public aware of the projects and programmes contained in Transport 21 and the benefits that will accrue from their implementation.</P>
        <P>My Department has over-arching responsibility as &ldquo;Managing Authority&rdquo; under EU rules for the effective management of the EU-assisted infrastructure elements (national roads, public transport, waste water, sustainable energy) of the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme (ESIOP) 2000-2006.  The end date for incurring expenditure on the EU-assisted elements is 31st December, 2008.</P>
        <P>While the management of this Programme includes responsibility for ensuring compliance with EU regulations on publicity requirements in relation to projects in receipt of EU Structural Fund assistance under the Programme, the implementation and funding of the EU publicity requirements is a matter for the agencies and bodies which have responsibility for delivery of the infrastructure projects concerned. No such advertising or publicity costs are borne by or attributable to the Department of Transport.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Advertising required under Section 8 of the Roads Act 2007 to redesignate dual carriageways to motorways in order to facilitate faster journey times, protection of investment in roads infrastructure, improvements in road safety and rationalisation of speed limits, has amounted to &euro;37,704 so far this year and is estimated to cost &euro;95,000 by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Advertising by the Irish Coast Guard in relation to the &ldquo;Safety on the water&rdquo; campaign has cost &euro;75,000 so far this year and is estimated to cost &euro;230,000 by the end of the year. An advertising campaign by the Marine Survey Office publicising a Safety Regulations Seminar in the printed media cost &euro;968.</P>
        <P>Advertising or promotional programmes undertaken by agencies or bodies under the aegis of my Department are undertaken by them in the exercise of their statutory functions. This is a day to day matter for those bodies.</P>

        <Quest> if his Department has in the year to date or intends by year end to carry out any advertising campaigns to promote policies or programmes being implemented by his Department; the details of those campaigns; the costs of advertising in publications, broadcast advertising, outdoor advertising and any consultancy or production costs incurred in the year to date, the costs that are expected to be incurred by year&rsquo;s end; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 to 123, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Advertising undertaken by my Department in Ireland typically includes advisory notices on public opening hours over holiday periods and public information notices relating to changes in passport application procedures and fees.  While much of this material is now placed on the Department&rsquo;s website, advertising continues to be necessary in order to reach all of our customers, particularly in relation to important passport and consular services.</P>
        <P>In addition to this routine advertising, this year the Department is undertaking a significant public information campaign in relation to the Lisbon Treaty, as well as a number of smaller campaigns in relation to the Irish Aid programme.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s total budget for the Lisbon Reform Treaty Information Campaign is &euro;800,000. The bulk of expenditure to date relates to the design, translation, printing and distribution of information material including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An explanatory pamphlet;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A guide to the Treaty which was published on 13 February and distributed to households in April;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The White Paper, which was published in April.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Other areas of expenditure in this campaign include maintenance of the dedicated website www.reformtreaty.ie , newspaper advertisements relating to the availability of information and the production of Braille and audio versions of the explanatory pamphlet.</P>
        <P>In 2008, the advertising budget for Irish Aid, the Division of my Department responsible for managing the official development assistance programme, is &euro;500,000. &euro;300,000 of this has been allocated for use in routine advertising such as recruitment to Irish Aid and volunteer positions, the placement of tender notices and information relating to grant application procedures.  The remaining &euro;200,000 has been allocated for use in public information campaigns, such as those around the opening of the Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre, World AIDS Day (1 December) and Africa Day (25 May).</P>
        <P>The information campaign in January and February 2008 relating to the opening of the Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre cost &euro;59,941. The advertising campaign for Africa Day, which was largely newspaper based, informed the public of free events taking place across the country. While final costs are still being assembled, the cost of newspaper advertising for the campaign was &euro;45,584. Public information campaigns, such as those around World AIDS Day and the opening of the Centre, raise awareness of overseas development challenges and highlight the Government&rsquo;s commitment to overseas development.</P>
        <P>With regard to the four bodies under the aegis of my Department, three of these have a research and advisory function, namely; the Advisory Board for Irish Aid, the Hunger Task <Col N="571"/>Force and the Development Education Advisory Committee, and have no budget for advertising.</P>
        <P>While the Fulbright Commission comes under the aegis of my Department and, as Minister, I have certain specific statutory responsibilities towards it, the Fulbright Commission enjoys &lsquo;autonomy of management and administration&rsquo;, under the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America), Act, 1991.</P>

	<P>On the 12th April, 2008, liquidators were appointed to Iralco Ltd, Collinstown, County Westmeath.  I understand that the liquidators are currently working through a list of potential investors and assessing their interest in investing in the plant. This process requires an assessment of the commercial viability of the business, the customer base, the financial investment and the changes required by any potential investor.  </P>
        <P>The efforts of the State development agencies have, and will continue to be, geared towards saving as many jobs as possible, including any possible assistance in the event of any takeover or management buyout options.</P>
        <P>The State development agencies are not party to discussions between the liquidators and the UNITE trade union group.  However, IDA Ireland is in regular contact with the liquidators with a view to securing an investor for the plant.</P>
        <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland and the other State development agencies, under the auspices of my Department will continue to work very closely with the liquidators and assist in any way they can during this challenging period.</P>

        <P>The expenditure by the Department on advertising for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 is published in the Department&rsquo;s annual reports. The bulk of the expenditure incurred is in respect of newspaper advertisements and advertisements in other publications such as the Phone Book and <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.</P>
        <P>In the three year period, promotion, media and advertising expenditure also formed a small element of the programme costs of the Rejoyce Festival, Beckett Centenary Festival, Dublin Theatre 50th Anniversary, Flight of the Earls Commemoration and Viking Longboat event. <Col N="577"/>The Department does not retain separate data in relation to the advertising expenditure which is included in grant aided initiatives.</P>
        <P>The advertising budget for 2008 is set out in the Book of Estimates. Expenditure to the end of April amounted to &euro;39,000. In line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government to continue with the scheme for National Awards to Volunteers in Irish Sport, it is intended that relevant advertising of this scheme will take place later in the year.</P>
        <P>In addition &euro;72,000 has been allocated by the Department to fund a National Cultural Institutions advertising and marketing campaign in 2008 to increase public awareness of collections, events and exhibitions.</P>

	<P>Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by the Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Applications for funding under the 2008 Programme were invited through advertisements in the Press on 13th and 14th of January and the deadline for receipt of applications was 29th February for paper-based applications and 7th March for on-line applications.

	<P>The Department aims to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their rights and entitlements and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur. The provision of information in a clear and accessible manner is an essential element in the achievement of this objective.  The Department uses a mix of advertising media including national and provincial newspapers, radio and television, information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots to ensure that people are aware of their social welfare entitlements and are notified about improvements and changes affecting their payments and services. The amount spent on advertising in any one year is determined by the number of specific advertising campaigns undertaken and the media used.</P>
        <P>In 2008 to-date advertisements have been placed in the newspapers inviting submissions and input from the public in relation to the Green Paper on Pensions, on the development of a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy and on the development of the Department&rsquo;s Customer Action Plan and Customer Charter. The full costs associated with these advertisements are outlined in the following table.  Two further campaigns are planned for later in the year in relation to the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and Budget 2009.  The estimated cost of each campaign is also given in the table.</P>

	<P>Where a payment to a supplier is not made promptly when due, the interest paid to the supplier effectively ensures that no significant financial advantage or disadvantage accrues to the Exchequer or the supplier respectively.  Since no significant net financial benefit arises in practice for either party there are no beneficiaries as such.</P>

	<P>My Department has not engaged, nor does it intend to engage, in any campaigns of the nature referred to by the Deputy in 2008.  For the sake of completeness, however, I should add that my Department is currently providing support of &euro;171,500 in total over three years to an international marketing programme entitled &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Islands&rdquo;, which is being managed and delivered by F&aacute;ilte Ireland. The objective of this programme is to enhance the awareness of the islands of Ireland as attractive locations to visit and to increase the number of visitors to the islands from abroad. While not an advertising campaign, per se, it includes certain elements in relation to which some advertising costs may arise.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>As the amount of legal fees and costs can vary from year to year depending on the number of cases and other variables, my Department does not retain a fixed budgetary allocation for such fees.  While indicative amounts may be set aside within particular expenditure subheads of my Department once a particular action is underway, it would not be prudent to ring-fence significant amounts as a general contingency, particularly when the length of the proceedings cannot be determined.</P>
        <P>My Department must also have regard to the fact that it is within the jurisdiction of the Courts to determine the outcome of litigation and to issue rulings in relation to the award of costs.</P>
        <P>The amount actually spent in the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 on legal fees and related costs (including settlements and payments awarded by the Courts) is as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2005 &mdash; &euro;2,916,000.00</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2006 &mdash; &euro;3,182,000.00</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2007 &mdash; &euro;1,474,000.00</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">It should be noted that these figures include legal costs relating to Community and Comprehensive Schools, as the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in respect of actions or claims made against them by visitors, parents or other members of the public in respect of accidents etc. occurring on school premises.  Also included is the cost of actions pursued by the State Claims Agency.</P>
        <P>Since 1st September 2005, all personal injury claims against the Minister for Education and Science have been delegated by the Government to the State Claims Agency.  A consequence of this is that the State Claims Agency has sole responsibility for deciding the approach to be <Col N="586"/>adopted in litigation and for determining how individual cases are conducted.  Payment of all State costs in these actions is made directly by the Department.</P>
        <P>Finally, it might also be noted that the bulk of the legal costs incurred by the State in defending those cases which are brought to court, are not met directly by my Department.  In accordance with financial procedures in cases involving damages or compensation against the State, costs are generally charged to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office Vote as sanctioned by the Attorney General.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware from my letter to him of 30 May, my Department is currently compiling a database on the schools that are using temporary rented accommodation.  As the Deputy will recall, approximately 900 schools were contacted by my Department and asked to complete a questionnaire regarding the stock of temporary accommodation in their schools.  As indicated in my letter, 803 schools from all counties returned the questionnaire and confirmed that they are occupying temporary accommodation.  My Department is currently pursuing the outstanding returns through its regional offices, with a view to completing the database.  As soon as the database is complete, I will write to the Deputy with a more complete picture of the situation.     </P>

	<P>The Department is continuing in its efforts to press for compliance with legislation in this area in consultation with the relevant agencies. The Companies Registration Office has already put in place a procedure whereby any business name applied for which features the term &ldquo;university&rdquo; will not be accepted without the express approval of my Department and the Irish Domain Registry has also agreed not to register web addresses containing the term &ldquo;university&rdquo; without reference to the Department.</P>
        <P>The existence of organisations of the type referred to by the Deputy is contrary to the interests of Ireland&rsquo;s higher education institutions, which have sought to preserve the high international standing and quality reputation of higher education in Ireland. The use of the National Framework of Qualifications to clearly and effectively communicate nationally and internationally the awarding bodies and qualifications (as well as associated lists of qualifications and institutions with programmes leading to them) that are recognised in Ireland is important.  Another important development will be the establishment of Education Ireland, which will take the lead role in promoting Irish education institutions overseas. It is proposed to establish this body later this year.</P>

	<P>In general, individual school authorities are responsible, in the first instance, under Safety, Health and Welfare at Work legislation for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care. It is the responsibility of individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. The Statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils. The Safety Statement should be reviewed on a regular basis. In practical terms, individual school authorities are best placed to assess the detail of their own health and safety requirements. </P>
        <P>In December 2007, (in conjunction with the changeover of primary school boards of management), all new boards were issued with an Information Manual which provides advice on matters relating to the governance of schools, including the obligations on boards of management in the context of Health and Safety Legislation.  A copy of this Information Manual is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>With regard to school building works, school managements are advised that renovation and improvement work of any kind, whether of a minor or major nature, must be undertaken in accordance with all relevant Health, Welfare and Safety at Work Regulations. Contractors appointed to carry out work in a school must be made aware of and requested to review the school&rsquo;s safety file to establish the position relating to any health and safety issues.</P>

        <Quest> the number of primary school principal teacher posts that are vacant; his views on whether there is a reluctance among deputy principals to apply for the principal post because of the increase in the level of responsibilities and duties with the poor compensatory allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The number of vacancies in primary schools including those at principal teacher level varies throughout the school year and are managed at local level by individual school Boards of Management. </P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Education Act, 1998, the Board of Management of a primary school is responsible for the recruitment, selection and appointment of all teachers to a school, including principal teachers. Appointments are notified to my Department by the Board of Management. My Department has no role in the selection and appointment process however I am aware of anecdotal evidence that workload issues of principal teachers can impact on the decision of teachers to apply for such posts.</P><Col N="590"/>
        <P>School principals play a key role in the successful operation of schools throughout the country and specific initiatives have been introduced over recent years that give more time for school principals to concentrate on the management aspects of their role.</P>
        <P>As part of the Programme for Government we are committed to supporting the role of principals through the provision of improved training options for principals, middle management and aspiring school leaders, to increase the number of release days for teaching principals, review the role of middle management in primary schools, to reduce the threshold for the appointment of deputy principals in primary schools, to substantially increase the ancillary services grant so that principals have better administrative support and to maximise the use of IT to cut down on administration and put a database in place to track primary pupils. The Programme for Government also provides that we will seek agreement through partnership for a facility to allow those who have served as principals for more than a certain number of years to return to full-time teaching duties, while maintaining some benefits.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Primary Administration Section of my Department has received correspondence from about 13 primary schools in relation to the water charges issue and the additional cost pressure that this puts on them. </P>
        <P>General cost pressures on all schools, including those arising from water charges, are being dealt with in the context of the Government commitment to improve funding for the day-to-day running costs of schools. Specific commitments in relation to improving school funding form a central part of the education provisions of the Programme for Government. These commitments are a direct follow on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of schools and primary schools in particular by doubling the capitation grant.</P>
        <P>In the context of reducing water costs for schools, it has been demonstrated that fitting simple water saving devices to toilets and sinks can reduce water consumption considerably at very little cost, as can other small works such as fixing easily identifiable leaks. Primary school authorities may use their annual minor works grant to fund such measures. The minor works grant has increased by nearly 50% over the past two years and some &euro;27m issued to primary schools at the end of last year for that purpose.</P>
        <P>The Government agreed a transition period to full water charges in the case of non-fee charging recognised schools and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has advised local authorities of the detailed arrangements regarding the implementation of this decision.</P>
        <P>The transitional arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place water conservation arrangements and practices and to undertake works that can help reduce water usage significantly before full water charges are introduced. By virtue of good water conservation schools can be in a much stronger position to reduce the impact of water charges on their overall budgets. Guidance was also recently issued to schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists. In addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of <Col N="591"/>routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme. Furthermore those schools with very high water consumption will be identified and contacted with a view to introducing measures to help them reduce water usage.</P>
        <P>My Department remains in close liaison with the Department of Environment and Local Government regarding water conservation and is supportive of any initiatives by it and local authorities that will help reduce water costs for schools.</P>

	<P>I am aware that there are more females than males entering the teaching profession and believe that it is important to attract more men into teaching for a number of reasons, not least of which is the positive role models that teachers provide in children&rsquo;s lives and the desirability of having both male and female role models in our schools.</P>
        <P>I believe that teaching is an attractive profession for both men and women. Teaching is fulfilling work which makes a huge social contribution.  This Government wants to attract and reward the best teachers and has undertaken a number of initiatives to enhance the status of the profession. Not least of these is the establishment of the Teaching Council as a professional regulatory body.</P>
        <P>In November 2005 the Report of the Primary Education Committee, &lsquo;Males into Primary Teaching&rsquo; was launched.   The Primary Education Committee was established in order to examine a range of issues in relation to males entering primary teaching, and to make recommendations on short-term and long-term strategies to increase the numbers in this regard. The Report draws on the professional insight of key experts in this area as well as drawing on a number of relevant research studies.</P>
        <P>One of the key recommendations in this report was that a coordinated promotion campaign, which would encourage boys as well as girls to enter primary teaching should be undertaken. This promotion campaign commenced in 2006 and promoted the rewards of being a teacher such as the value to society, work/life balance, career satisfaction, diversity of skills, professional development, conditions of employment and job security.</P>
        <P>Since the launch of the campaign the number of male student teachers has risen slightly from 124 in 2005 to 185 in 2007.</P>

	<P>The cost of advertising, which includes, for example, expenditure on the following significant categories, invitations to tender for school building projects, staff appointments in the education sector, invitations to attend local hearings, invitations to forward submissions on education related schemes/projects, and promotional campaigns, is not a separate sub-head, with a specified annual allocation, in the Department&rsquo;s Vote.</P>
        <P>These advertising costs, as they arise on various programmes and schemes, are ultimately charged to an appropriate subhead of the Vote generally dealing with the particular programme or scheme. Accordingly, to gauge the likely advertising cost at year end would entail an inordinate amount of work, in collating costs across many programmes, for what would still be an estimated figure.</P>
        <P>My Department is able however to track the level of actual spending on advertising and has spent approximately &euro;168,000 to the end of May this year in this regard.</P>
        <P>As the placing of advertising is generally contingent on the progress of programmes/schemes and policies the scheduling of advertising campaigns needs to be flexible and therefore the Department cannot easily identify the advertising campaigns it may require from one year to the next.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy has a particular advertising campaign in mind I would be happy to have my officials obtain the relevant details and communicate them to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The vast majority of the Department&rsquo;s advertising is placed in the print media.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The State's advertising is subject to a tender process through the Government Supplies Agency. I understand from the Office of Public Works that the current State advertising contract, which came into effect in December 2007 stipulates that the costs of the advertisements are inclusive of all production costs associated with the insertion of the advertisements into the print media.</P>

        <Quest> if the IBEC-sponsored programme which resulted in funding of over &euro;5 million a year since 2005 for the provision of broadband in schools will not be continued under the schools broadband access programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Schools Broadband Access Programme is being undertaken in partnership with industry in the context of a Government &mdash; IBEC/TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) Agreement to provide local broadband connectivity to schools. This voluntary Agreement provides for the establishment of a three year &euro;18m joint Government-IBEC/TIF Fund, with industry contributing &euro;5m per annum and the Government contributing &euro;1m per annum.  To date the receipts to the Fund comprise the State&rsquo;s contributions of &euro;3m and &euro;8.03m from IBEC/TIF contributing members.</P>
        <P>The Programme has three elements &mdash; local connectivity to schools, a national broadband network and a broadband support service desk. Schools connectivity is being routed to the Internet through a national broadband network, which is supported by HEAnet and provides centrally managed services for schools such as security, anti-spam/ anti-virus and content filtering. The broadband support service desk has been established to interface between the network, the local broadband service Access Providers and schools. It is managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE).  The total costs of the Programme for the first three years, including the initial set-up costs, are some &euro;30m.</P><Col N="594"/>
        <P>The funding Agreement with TIF, which provides for the &euro;18m Fund, is to meet the local connectivity element of the Programme costs.</P>
        <P>The Agreement with TIF provides for the appointment of a Programme Evaluator to independently evaluate progress on the deployment of broadband access to schools and the impact of such deployment in schools over the period of the Schools Broadband Access Programme.  The Terms of Reference for the Programme Evaluator were agreed with TIF in February 2008 and following a public procurement process, Norcontel (Ireland) Ltd has been selected to undertake the evaluation.  The final evaluation report is expected to be completed by August, 2008.</P>
        <P>My Department will shortly issue a Request for Tenders for the next round of service. The priority for the new procurement process will be to ensure that the broadband services to schools keep in line with national infrastructure improvements. The RFT will seek tenders which at least maintain the existing service (in terms of speed and reliability) that schools currently receive.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the general developments in broadband availability nationally, improved service offerings are expected to be received under the new tender process.</P>
        <P>I would like to acknowledge the co-operation and contribution of the TIF to the initiative to date and I look forward to developing the partnership into the future.</P>

	<P>The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) is an independent statutory agency under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children and it is not open to me to intervene in its affairs or decisions. I understand that the NCSS has announced a preferred bidder for the provision of laboratory testing services for the National Cervical Screening Programme. Pending completion of the procurement process and clarification of future staffing requirements in cytology services it is not possible to assess fully the implications of the decision by the NCSS for the future employment opportunities of graduates of the Bachelor of Science (Medical and Molecular Cytology) at Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
        <P>The employment of graduates from the programme is a matter for the HSE, and private employers in this area and other related fields.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 178 together.</P>
        <P>It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0010/2008, available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The first meeting of the Appeal Board to consider applications for the 2008/09 school year took place on 20th May, 2008. Further meetings will be held in June and October, 2008. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 20 June and 10 October respectively.</P>
        <P>Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>At its meeting of 20 May 2008, the Board considered 25 appeals in relation to the 2008/09 school year. Three appeals were deferred until the October meeting of the Appeal Board when the school enrolments projected for 30 September 2008 will be available. The Appeal Board deferred a decision on 6 appeal applications pending receipt of further information and 16 appeals were refused.</P>
        <P>The members of the Appeal Board are: Dr. Tom McCarthy, Chairperson, Mr. Frank Davis, Ms. Monica Healy, Ms. Mairead McGowan and Mr. Sean Nolan.  Staff from the Primary Payments Section of my Department provide administrative assistance to the Appeal Board but are not members of the Board.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> the reason an institution (details supplied) in Dublin 6 was not included in the schedule of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 despite the institution being subject to a regulatory or inspection function, a fact recognised by the Department of Health and Children; and if he will include the institutions in a revised schedule. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22411/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board was established under Statute in 2002 and is governed by the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002. The Board was established to make fair and reasonable payments to persons who, as children, were abused while residents in Industrial Schools, Reformatories and other institutions subject to State regulation or inspection and who were placed in such institutions by the State.  The Board is independent in the performance of its functions.</P>
        <P>When the Act was initially established, the Schedule to the Act contained a total of 128 institutions. In compiling the list, the Department of Education &amp; Science had cause to make enquiries from the Department of Health &amp; Children, under whose jurisdiction some of the institutions operated, as to whether certain institutions could be considered for inclusion having regard to the criteria for eligibility. The intention was that all institutions which were brought to the attention of my Department would be considered and a decision made as to their eligibility for inclusion prior to the closing date for receipt of applications to the Board which was the 15th December 2005.</P><Col N="598"/>
        <P>Since the enactment of the legislation, my Department received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of other institutions which may warrant consideration for inclusion. Following consideration of the matter, an Order was signed on 9th November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule. A further Order was made on 1st July 2005 adding 3 institutions to the Schedule.</P>
        <P>The question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered by my Department and it is not proposed to add any further institutions to the Schedule.</P>
        <P>In making its initial enquiries in relation to the institution in question, my Department consulted with the Department of Health &amp; Children to establish if it could be considered for inclusion on the Schedule to the Act. The response to my Department was that, following a review of papers available in the Department of Health &amp; Children, they were unable to locate any documentation which would indicate that a public body had an inspection or regulatory function in relation to the institution. At that time, the Department of Health &amp; Children was not in a position to recommend its inclusion in the Schedule. Given that we were not in a position to confirm whether there was a state inspection or regulatory role, the institution could not be considered to be eligible for inclusion.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the Department of Health advised this Department in May 2007 that certain papers had come to light which indicated a state regulatory and inspection role and that this Department may now wish to consider its inclusion on the Schedule to the Redress Act.</P>
        <P>However, further enquiries made by this Department with the Department of Health &amp; Children revealed that one of the papers in relation to the institution which prompted them to recognise a regulatory or inspection function was the report of an inspection conducted under the Registration of Maternity Homes Act, 1934. The expression &ldquo;maternity home&rdquo; means &ldquo;any premises which are, either wholly or partly, used or intended to be used for the reception of pregnant women or women immediately after childbirth&rdquo;. There are several references on the papers held by the Department of Health &amp; Children describing this institution as a Mother and Baby Home. It would seem that persons in this facility attended on a voluntary basis as opposed to having been placed there by the State.</P>
        <P>Section 4(1) of the Act states that the Minister for Education &amp; Science, may, by Order, provide for the insertion of any industrial school, reformatory, orphanage, children&rsquo;s home, special school which was established for the purpose of providing education services to children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or illness.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the information available to this Department that the institution to which the Deputy refers operated as a Mother and Baby Home and is therefore not eligible to be considered for inclusion on the Schedule to the Redress Act on the basis that it does not satisfy the criteria as set out in the aforementioned Section.</P>
        <P>I should of course point out that ineligibility to be considered for redress under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002, does not affect a person&rsquo;s statutory right to pursue other legal avenues which may be open to them.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Office of Public Works (OPW), which acts on behalf of my Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, has been asked to source a suitable site for the school in question. My Department is advised that the Health Service Executive (HSE) have formally conveyed its approval to dispose of lands either to South Tipperary County Council or directly to the OPW. The OPW are currently awaiting written confirmation from the HSE that they are prepared to sell a site to them.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that the school referred to by the Deputy applied for works under the 2008 Summer Works Scheme.</P>
        <P>Since the Summer Works Scheme was introduced in 2004, over 3,000 projects costing in excess of &euro;300 million have been completed. With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also showing the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. Accordingly my Department is focusing on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and there is no Summer Works Scheme this year. However, it is intended to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware the July Education Programme is available to all special schools and mainstream primary schools with special classes catering for children with autism who choose to extend their education services through the month of July.

There has been a steady increase in the number of schools offering the programme since it was introduced in 2001 when relevant schools were circulated with details.</P>
        <P>Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The new female prison forms part of the overall prison development at Thornton Hall and it is not, for practical, commercial and procurement reasons, possible to provide details as to the likely cost of individual components of it.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to move away from the basic architectural design principles of the Dochas Centre.  The design has proved to be a successful model and the design of the women&rsquo;s prison at Thornton seeks to build on the experience and lessons of the Dochas model, whilst expanding the regime options and fostering the ethos of Dochas, i.e., a domestic scale courtyard development consisting of a number of house units of single occupancy en-suite accommodation.  However a major problem with the existing Dochas centre is a lack of capacity &mdash; it is currently the most overcrowded prison institution in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>When the Thornton Hall development is completed the Dochas Centre along with the other facilities on the Mountjoy campus will be closed.  It would be neither operationally nor financially viable to maintain the Dochas Centre as a stand alone institution and construct a second female prison in the Dublin area.</P>

        <Quest> the arrangements in place for the follow-up on the implementation of community services orders <Col N="605"/>that were given out through the courts in the years 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007; and if an efficiency review has been undertaken. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, provides that a Court may make a Community Service Order as an alternative to a sentence of imprisonment or detention in respect of any individual over the age of 16 years who has been convicted of a criminal offence and who consents to the Order being made.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Community Service Order requires an offender to perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours, usually to be completed within 12 months.  The aim of a Community Service Order is to rehabilitate the offender and make meaningful reparation to the community for his or her crime.  Community Service Supervisors work alongside offenders undergoing their community service work.  However, the Probation Service of my Department has overall responsibility for the supervision and management of Community Service Orders.</P>
        <P>The range of work generally carried out by offenders on Community Service Orders, including painting, decorating, landscaping, clearing/maintenance of community facilities (indoor and outdoor), restoration or enhancement of existing facilities such as community centres, youth clubs, grass cutting, cleaning graveyards and work with community groups in groups.</P>
        <P>The express purpose of Community Service is to provide benefit at no cost to communities, and indirectly to victims through the work of offenders as reparation.  Community Service is widely recognised as a practical and visible embodiment of Restorative Justice principles and offender reparation, in particular.</P>
        <P>Community Service projects are identified and established with the assistance and support of local community organisations and interests.  There is ongoing communication and consultation by the Probation Service with local communities to maximise the benefits of Community Service.</P>
        <P>A key action within the Probation Service Strategy and Workplan is to maximise the benefit of Community Service to local communities by reforming, revitalising and restructuring its delivery.  An independent review of the operation of Community Service is currently being completed by consultants to advise on the most appropriate model and structure of the operation of Community Service.  Having regards to the commitment in the Programme for Government, I await the findings of that review.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that all prisoners are advised of the services available to them on committal to prison and have access to these services through a number of channels, including requests to prison officers on their landings.  Prison staff are proactive in referring prisoners to services where they have concerns about their well-being.  Longer term prisoners have their cases reviewed on an ongoing basis by multi-disciplinary teams which include prison management and the professional services.  In addition, reviews are carried out in respect of prisoners who are engaged with the Parole Board, which relates to prisoners serving sentences of eight years or more.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that appropriate regimes programmes, such as meaningful activities and contact with the outside world, are important in preventing potential institutionalisation. Considerable effort goes into ensuring that prisoners have and make use of opportunities for structured activity such as education, work and training, and programmes to address their offending behaviour and personal needs, as well as opportunities for regular exercise and contacts with family and friends.</P>
        <P>While every effort is made to address areas of need for prisoners, the Deputy will appreciate that this also requires the active co-operation of the prisoner involved.</P>

	<P>Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) on 17 May, 2005 and was extended nationwide in 2006.  It is an intelligence led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static check points by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.</P>
        <P>The estimated cost of Operation Anvil from June 2005 to the end of May 2008 was &euro;98.9 million.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has publicly re-affirmed his commitment to the objectives of Operation Anvil.  The Operation is augmented by other initiatives, both locally and nationally, and will continue to be undertaken by all units and sections of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The following table shows the outcomes from Operation Anvil up to 1 June, 2008 in the DMR.  Operation Anvil outside the DMR differs from the DMR, in that operations have a short time-focus and are designed to address, in a flexible fashion, the particular needs of specific areas.  Outside the DMR up to 4 May, 2008 734 firearms were seized, and 18,295 arrests were made.</P>

	<P>Delivery of units under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006 is necessarily subject to a number of variables.  These include the volume of housing development for which planning permission is granted, the finalisation of individual agreements between local authorities and developers, the timing of commencement and phasing of individual developments, and the general level of activity within the sector itself.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have been advised to conclude Part V agreements with developers at the earliest possible stage to ensure the successful delivery of social and affordable housing.  Where agreement is reached between the authority and developer on the Part V requirement, it is included as a condition of the granting of planning permission and remains enforceable for the lifetime of the permission which is normally 5 years.  My Department will continue to keep the position in relation of Part V agreements under review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The revised suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for older people and people with a disability introduced in November 2007 provide a more targeted and integrated response to the housing needs of older people and people with a disability, while ensuring that those households in greatest need benefit from the available funding.  Under the new schemes eligibility for grant aid is determined on the basis of household means.  Under the previous grant aid framework, some local authorities applied a means test, while others did not.  My Department has developed a standardised means test to be used by all local authorities in order to provide a fair and uniform approach to the new schemes across the country, while also ensuring that those households in greatest need benefit from the available funding.</P>
        <P>The conditions applying to the grants schemes, including means-testing, are contained in the Housing (Adaptation Grants for Older People and People With a Disability), Regulations 2007.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the high cost of oil and the affect that this continuing hike in prices is having on the Irish economy; his views on whether the application of the improved rate of exchange namely the differential between the US Dollar and the Euro is being passed on to the Irish consumer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The price of oil is set on international markets, and is outside Ireland&rsquo;s direct control.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  There is free entry into the market.  Prices at the pump reflect global market price, transportation costs, Euro/Dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.  Crude oil prices have recently reached record levels and this is reflected in the prices of oil products.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority is a statutory independent body with a specific role in the enforcement of competition law.  The National Consumer Agency has specific responsibilities for protecting the rights of consumers.  Their function is to ensure that competition works optimally for the benefit of consumers throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s high dependence on imported oil makes us price takers, sensitive to the volatility of the markets and reflecting a range of market factors.</P>
        <P>The increase in the price of petrol and diesel is affecting all of Europe.  EU price figure comparisons, published on 26th May 2008, show that the average price of petrol in April in Ireland was &euro;1.21 per litre and this ranks as the seventh cheapest of 27 Member States.  The average price of petrol in the UK in the same report was &euro;1.42 per litre and the EU average price was &euro;1.41 per litre.  The average price of diesel in Ireland in April as reported by the EU on 26th May was &euro;1.25 per litre.  This price ranks as the seventh cheapest price out of the 27 EU Member States reported by the EU on that date.  The average price of diesel in the UK in the same report was &euro;1.56 per litre and the average EU price for diesel was &euro;1.42 per litre.  These comparisons show that Ireland is by no means the worst affected country in Europe in relation to the prices of petrol and diesel.</P>
        <P>It is also the case that the increase in the price of oil generally, for both petrol and diesel, would be even higher for the consumer if the effect had not been moderated to date by the sharp depreciation of the dollar against the Euro.  This is particularly clear when recent price increases for a barrel of oil are compared with relative increases in diesel and petrol prices.</P>
        <P>Government policy on prices, including the price of commodities such as petrol and diesel, is concentrated on the promotion of competition, consumer choice and awareness.  Petrol stations are required to display their prices in a clear manner, so that consumers can make an informed choice when purchasing fuel.  Consumer protection is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and consumers can report any infringements of the law to the National Consumer Agency.</P>
        <P>The upward global trend in oil prices reinforces the imperative for Ireland to reduce its oil dependency and to use energy wisely and efficiently.  The actions we are taking to accelerate delivery of our targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency are essential to ensure a sustainable energy future for the economy and for consumers.</P>

	<P>I am confident that we will meet the Government&rsquo;s targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency as set out in the Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government.  We have put in place a range of actions to ensure progressive delivery on these targets, which will contribute to our overall emissions reductions targets.</P><Col N="615"/>
        <P>In the electricity market we will increase the contribution by renewable energy sources to at least 15% by 2010 and 33% by 2020 of electricity consumed and work towards the higher levels of renewables indicated as being possible in our all island grid study.  Between 2003 and 2006 the contribution doubled from 4.3% to 8.6% and is expected to have increased to around 9.5% when data is available for 2007.</P>
        <P>In Biofuels for transport we have committed to sustainable delivery of a target of 5.75% by 2010 and to a further target of 10% by 2020.  Delivery of these targets will be underpinned by the Biofuels Obligation, which will be introduced in 2009, which will take full account of the sustainability criteria we are working on in the Council working group.</P>
        <P>In the heat sector, targets of 5% and 12% market penetration by 2010 and 2020 respectively are being delivered through the Greener Homes, ReHeat and Combined Heat and Power grants programmes.</P>
        <P>We have set a National energy efficiency target of 20% by 2020, which includes a higher 30% target for the public sector.  Measures to achieve this were signalled in the Draft Energy Efficiency Action Plan, which my Department published in late 2007.</P>
        <P>A revised National Energy Efficiency Action Plan will be published shortly.</P>
