	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>From time to time, there have been requests to my Department for files and information from various tribunals.  My Department has co-operated fully with all such requests and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
        <P>Normally requests from tribunals are received by the Secretary General of my Department and assigned to the appropriate departmental officials by him.  Appropriate replies subsequently issue when the requests have been considered and any relevant information or files have been identified.</P>
        <P>All inquiries to my Department from tribunals and all replies that are issued by my Department to tribunals are dealt with on a highly confidential basis, as required by the tribunals themselves.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the substance or the number of requests received in my Department from tribunals.  It is a matter for the tribunals themselves to consider if and when to disclose such information in the interests of ensuring that the work of the tribunals is not encroached upon.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="704"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach a number of questions on this matter.  How many files have been supplied to the various tribunals by his Department? How many files have been requested and transferred to the various tribunals by his Department?  Can he confirm that the file dealing with the State&rsquo;s purchase of the Battle of the Boyne commemorative site is one such file?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said in my reply, I am not in a position to discuss, with regard to any of these matters, issues which the tribunals themselves have stated are highly confidential.  It is a matter for the tribunals to disclose if they so wish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow Deputy Kenny to ask one supplementary question as we must move on to other Deputies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a few, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Deputy does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I wished to know the number of files transferred from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department to the tribunals, but the Taoiseach has not confirmed this.  He is reluctant to say whether the file on the purchase of the Battle of the Boyne site was requested.  He did say that his Department co-operates fully in supplying the relevant information, which is gathered on a confidential basis, to the tribunals.  However, there is a great deal of public information available on the file to which I refer because of one person who was associated with the group that bought the site in 1997 for &pound;2.7 million.  The site was sold for &pound;7.8 million two years later.  Despite the fact that the Department of Foreign Affairs was opposed to the holding of such a commemoration, it was taken to a point at which the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor requested that a meeting take place between the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, former Deputy S&iacute;le de Valera, and Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan to investigate whether it could be included in the millennium projects.</P>
        <P>The former Taoiseach did answer one question on this matter but subsequently refused to answer any other questions.  I do not know what the Taoiseach has in front of him but perhaps he would comment on what was actually going on between the Department of Foreign Affairs and his Department and whether the person associated with the group that originally purchased the site was directly involved.  It is a matter of public interest.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that if questions are asked about the Battle of the Boyne site he will answer them, unlike his predecessor who shoved them off somewhere else?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a question of shoving anything off anywhere else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is, because the former Taoiseach would not answer the questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a question of appropriateness.  We have set up tribunals of inquiry to look into various matters.  The requests for information from the tribunal were made on a confidential basis and it would be improper for me to divulge the content of that correspondence.  That is the situation as far as the tribunals are concerned.  It is they who make the requests.  People must understand that it would be totally inappropriate for me to divulge any information about the correspondence received in my Department from the various tribunals.  All such queries comprise the private phases of the tribunals&rsquo; work.  For reasons of confidentiality required by the tribunals I am prohibited from going into any more detail.  We must respect the tribunals in the conduct of their work.  That is the reason I must give the answer I am giving.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="705"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must move across to Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Ceann Comhairle come back to me?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Are there any requests for files that are still outstanding?  In addition, was any request for files by any of the tribunals declined by his Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  In the body of my reply I confirmed that the Department has co-operated fully with all such requests and will continue to do so in the future.  As I said, from time to time my Department has been requested by various tribunals to supply files and information, which has been forwarded to them.  I cannot add to that.  There is nothing outstanding as far as I know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Why is the Taoiseach not more forthcoming on the questions asked by Deputy Kenny?  What is preventing him from providing the information about a specific file that would confirm or deny what Deputy Kenny asked?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised &mdash; it is a requirement of the tribunal &mdash; that, for reasons of confidentiality during the private phase of the tribunal&rsquo;s work, I am prohibited from going into further detail.  If the tribunal wishes to pursue an issue, it will be put in the public domain in accordance with the tribunal&rsquo;s procedures.  As far as the tribunals are concerned, I am not in a position to discuss this matter further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the Taoiseach quoted accurately when it was reported that he stated there was merit in the view expressed by his predecessor that the tribunals of inquiry should be scrapped?  The former Taoiseach has called for a review of the Tribunals of Inquiry Act.  In what I have read of his comments, he called for future tribunals under new legislation to be under the supervision of an Oireachtas committee.  Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s opinion that there is a proposition for a hybrid?  Surely it is either a case of tribunals of inquiry under new legislation and procedures or what could be described as an investigation by an Oireachtas committee.  To what was the former Taoiseach referring and does it reflect the Taoiseach&rsquo;s opinion on how these matters should proceed?  Will there be further legislation in respect of tribunals of inquiry or will a mechanism be found?  I suggest the merit of and seek the Taoiseach&rsquo;s opinion on the usefulness of engaging in a public consultation process as to the means that should be employed for addressing matters of such import as those referred to tribunals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot refer to the quote.  I do not recall making that comment.  I stated that there was merit in considering future procedures for investigating matters of public interest given that these proceedings have been ongoing for a considerable length of time, far beyond the contemplation of those who proposed establishing them originally.</P>
        <P>The Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 provides for comprehensive reform and consolidation of current legislation to put in place a modern and comprehensive statutory framework governing all aspects of the operation of a tribunal from the time of its establishment to publication of its reports.  In large part, the Bill implements the recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s final report on public inquiries, including tribunals of inquiry, published in May 2005, particularly those relating to the more efficient management and operation of inquiries.  The Bill contains a number of significant provisions to ensure greater control of legal costs at tribunals.  Section 25 provides that a tribunal can only grant representation where it is satisfied <Col N="706"/>that the person&rsquo;s constitutional or legal rights are likely to be affected by the proceedings before the tribunal or where there are exceptional circumstances for granting representation.</P>
        <P>The Bill comprises a number of improvements.  While a tribunal of inquiry can be established by a resolution of the Houses, there is no statutory basis whereby the Oireachtas, should it so wish, can suspend or dissolve a tribunal.  In line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on this point, the Bill provides at sections 9 and 10 that the Government may, for stated reasons and on foot of an order approved by each House, suspend an inquiry in whole or in part to allow for the completion of any other inquiry or the determination of any civil or criminal proceedings relating to matters to which the inquiry relates or to dissolve a tribunal for stated reasons.  Before the Government makes an order under either section, the responsible Minister must consult with the tribunal.</P>
        <P>Ensuring a clear statutory basis for a suspension or dissolution of a tribunal represents a sensible approach to a sensitive issue and closes a gap in existing legislation.  It is self-evident that, if the Oireachtas has the power to establish a tribunal, it should have the power to dissolve one.  The requirement for consultation with the tribunal and the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas prior to a suspension or dissolution will ensure these powers are exercised appropriately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Having given that lengthy reply, will the Taoiseach indicate his position on the raft of inquiries currently sitting and his intent in regard to legislation in this area?  Does he accept that the critical concern of the vast majority of the public is the exorbitant cost and the inordinate length of time that these inquiries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is straying into the whole question of tribunals generally and that is not related to the questions under discussion, which deal with requests for files.  We must stay within the parameters of the questions or we will be all over the place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The questions under discussion relate to tribunals of inquiry.  The key issues of concern are exorbitant cost and inordinate delay.  Does the Taoiseach agree with that and does he intend to address it?  Does he also agree the public has no issue with the process of probing for the truth that is under way?  The critical issues are exorbitant cost and inordinate delay.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach was cited as indicating there was merit in the view expressed by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in regard to the tribunals.  If he is not familiar with the particular reference, I will send it to him.  Does the Taoiseach agree with his predecessor when the latter referred to himself in an interview in last week&rsquo;s <i>Sunday Independent</i> as somebody who was being victimised and compared himself with Parnell and the former United States President, Bill Clinton?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant.  I will not allow that question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach see his predecessor in that light?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not matter how the Taoiseach sees his predecessor.  There will be no light cast on that today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle is having no more of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not allowing the question because it is not relevant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked several questions.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="707"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>None of them is relevant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>At least Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is consistent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entitled to an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is not entitled to an answer if his question is not relevant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not write the piece in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not write Standing Orders.  Nor did I write the piece in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, I assure the Deputy of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Taoiseach for a simple reply to a number of questions that are pertinent to the tribunals and which relate to the issues raised in this series of questions.  I am entitled to a reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is entitled to a reply to his first question but not to the question about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s views on his predecessor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My views on tribunals of inquiry are clear.  They must deal with issues far more speedily, comprehensively and efficiently than we have seen.  That is my honest view.</P>
        <P>I understand the members of the tribunals currently sitting have indicated they will conclude their public sessions at the end of the summer.  I look forward to receiving their reports and to getting on with our business here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In his reply, the Taoiseach said the information in question was collected and forwarded to the tribunals on the basis of confidentiality and that it would not be appropriate to comment on that here.  Answering questions on the Battle of the Boyne site on 1 May last year, his predecessor said he had made no recommendation to the Department of Foreign Affairs on the acquisition of the site.  Notwithstanding the confidentiality requirements under the Freedom of Information Act, restricted though it is, letters were produced which clearly showed that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, arranged for a meeting between the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and the then Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Brennan, to see whether this could be accommodated as part of the millennium projects.  Was it the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of the Taoiseach which drove this project?</P>
        <P>Given that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor answered one question on this site, in respect of which an acquaintance of his made a substantial finder&rsquo;s fee when it was sold to the State for more than &euro;7 million, is the Taoiseach prepared to answer questions on it if they are put to him?  In other words, does it concern the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Foreign Affairs?  The former Taoiseach answered one question and then said he would not answer any more.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to answer questions as they come under his remit?</P>
        <P>Further to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s question and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s belief that his predecessor was telling the truth to the Mahon tribunal, does the Taoiseach have a view on Deputy Bertie Ahern&rsquo;s comment that the workings of the Mahon tribunal are &ldquo;low-life stuff&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>These questions are very clear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>So was the question I asked.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="708"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>They relate to the procedures and the number of requests since 2002.  We cannot stray into other areas.  If the Deputy wishes to put down a question about other matters, he is entitled to do so, but I have to stay within Standing Orders because otherwise we will be all over the countryside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When I put questions to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor, he answered one of them and refused to answer any more.  My questions to the Taoiseach are clear.  If I put down questions about this site, will the Taoiseach answer them?  Is the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of the Taoiseach in charge of this?  I am entitled to ask him, as Taoiseach and leader of the country politically, whether he shares the view that the workings of the Mahon tribunal are low-life stuff.  I have one further question to ask him when he answers these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the matters raised by Deputy Kenny, any question put to my Department can be answered if the information is available as appropriate in the Department.  I cannot anticipate whether a specific question about any matter is under my aegis since it predated my appearance in this office.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no objection in principle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will certainly be available to assist in whatever way I can. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We will try and see.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not to be taken as a prior commitment on what the answer will be.</P>
        <P>The former Taoiseach is entitled to the same presumptions as any other citizen going before that tribunal.  On Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question about the particular phrase used, Deputy Bertie Ahern went to court and was fully vindicated in respect of some of the issues put to him which were not regarded as complying with fair procedures.  Let the record speak for itself in respect of that comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree with Deputy Bertie Ahern about low-life stuff?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a further question for the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I answered the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will return to Deputy Kenny.  I call Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I have three questions arising from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s responses.  With regard to the file on the Battle of the Boyne site, I do not understand how the Taoiseach is prohibited from telling the House whether it has been requested by the tribunal by virtue of confidentiality of correspondence between the tribunal and the Department of the Taoiseach.  We are not asking what was in the file or what was supplied to the tribunal.  We simply want an answer regarding whether the file was sought by the tribunal.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach referred to the Tribunals of Inquiries Bill 2005, Second Stage of which began in this House in November 2007, although we have not seen it since then.  Is the Government still proceeding with that Bill and where is it?  Is it being withheld?</P><Col N="709"/>
        <P>With regard to the costs of the tribunals, the then Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, announced in 2004 a new scale of fees which was supposed to come into effect in September 2006.  That scale of fees was confirmed in February 2006 but was subsequently withdrawn by the Government in July 2006.  A new deadline of March 2007 was set for the implementation of new fees.  None of these have been met.  Why has the Government not implemented the revised scale of fees for lawyers at the tribunal, which was set and announced four years ago, in 2004?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the first matter, as I said previously, the questions I was asked pertained to various matters and I had to answer in the way I did based on the requirements of the tribunal itself.  I am not suggesting whether a particular file was sent there, I am simply making the point that whatever requests come to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office in regard to its private business, I am required to observe the confidentiality it insists upon.  All I can say is that whatever information was sought, it was provided. I am not indicating whether a particular file was sent to the tribunal.  That is a matter that is confidential between the tribunal and the Department.  Requests do not come to me, as political head of the Department; they come to the Secretary General, who sends them on to the relevant officer.  That is the position and, unfortunately, I cannot be any more specific.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It was at the request of the chairperson of the tribunal that we were asked to defer the implementation of the new fee structure.  This was on the basis of commitments that were received regarding the tribunal finalising its work.  As the Deputy stated, that work has extended beyond the period originally envisaged.  We understand, however, that it will be completed.  If we had proceeded with the new fee structure against the chairperson&rsquo;s wishes, we could have been accused of interfering with the tribunal&rsquo;s work.  In conjunction with the chairpersons of the tribunals, the Government is acting in good faith in the interests of having the matters being investigated finalised as quickly as possible and ensuring that there will be no necessity to replace personnel or whatever in the event of the arrangements relating to fees being altered.  That is what we are trying to achieve.</P>
        <P>As far as I recall, we received a commitment that the public hearings should end some time early in the second half of the year.  We hope the preparation of reports will commence at that stage and that these reports will be forthcoming.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>The Moriarty tribunal has missed a series of deadlines and it appears to be holding very few meetings at present.  In view of the fact that this tribunal is sponsored by his Department, has the Taoiseach been provided with a timescale regarding the completion of its work?  Would it be possible to encourage the Moriarty tribunal to produce its report as expeditiously as possible in order that there might be finality in respect of at least one of the tribunals?</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>These questions relate to the findings of the Quigley report, which was published in 2005.  That report highlighted the need for special care in cases where a proposed consultancy comprises an element of direct service to a Minister or Minister of State, particularly in the public relations or communications areas, and-or where a Minister or a Minister of State suggests the name of a person or enterprise as being suitable.</P>
        <P>As my predecessor previously outlined, following publication of the Quigley report, additional procurement guidelines were approved by the Government and are published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The guidelines were brought to the attention of all Secretaries General, who were asked to implement them and to bring them in future to the attention of all newly-appointed Ministers and Ministers of State, where relevant, in their Departments or offices.</P>
        <P>The guidelines give the Secretary General to the Government and the Government secretariat a role in examining certain procurements.  However, there is neither a special unit in my Department nor an interdepartmental group chaired by it to oversee the awarding of public relations contracts by Ministers.  Any workload arising from the application of these additional procedures is handled, within existing resources, by the Government secretariat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">An inquiry previously took place into the current Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, and allegations regarding the awarding of contracts within one of the Departments in which he formerly served.  Following this inquiry, a new system was put in place for new Ministers and Ministers of State that any public relations or other contracts would have to be approved by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach recently appointed some new Ministers and Ministers of State.  Have any changes been introduced in respect of public relations contracts since those appointments were made?  Have new Ministers or Ministers of State made inquiries about this matter with the Taoiseach in line with the recommendations of the inquiry to which I refer regarding how any new contracts might be awarded?</P>
        <P>It appears the Government will be spending &euro;35 million in two areas over a period.  Some &euro;15 million will be spent on matters relating to climate change, while a further &euro;20 million &mdash; &euro;3 million of it this year &mdash; will be spent during the period of Transport 21.</P>
    
        <P>I do not know how the Taoiseach feels but for me there are very few things as frustrating as sitting at traffic lights which turn green three times without the traffic moving, yet there are 40 ft. by 80 ft. billboards indicating the Government is spending &euro;34 billion on Transport 21.  That &euro;20 million on public relations about Transport 21 will not build one extra school where people <Col N="711"/>have been waiting 15 years in some cases.  It will not provide an extra bed or ameliorate any traffic jam at street corners.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is now in charge of the country, having previously been in charge of the Department of Finance, and he must tighten up on this.  Is there a need to spend &euro;20 million telling the people that the Government expects to spend &euro;34 billion on Transport 21 when people are sitting in traffic, frustrated and giving out?  It would be far better to use that money on the relief of blockages in the health or education systems.</P>
        <P>There is little point in having 40 ft. by 80 ft. billboards indicating spending of &euro;34 billion when a person is stuck at the Red Cow roundabout, or elsewhere, with the traffic lights going green three times without traffic moving.  There would be a strong measure of cross-party support for cutting down seriously on what is an obscene waste of money in many respects.  Telling the people about spending &euro;34 billion through huge billboards and other media campaigns while they are not moving in traffic does not seem to be good value for the taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Were that true, it might be a point, but only &euro;3 million has been allocated this year in assisting to bring to people&rsquo;s attention Transport 21, what it means and what it will do for people.  It is not a question of &euro;20 million being spent.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It is over the period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No allocations whatever are agreed for 2009 to 2011, inclusive, and these matters must be reviewed on a constant basis.  I have indicated to colleagues that this is an area in which I will expect a report.  I will make the point before everybody goes off thinking &euro;20 million is being spent, that it is not.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a plan to spend it.</P>

	<P>I am trying to include everybody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Quigley report, there was a recommendation that where public relations or communications consultancy work was to be obtained by a Minister, and where that was of either direct service to the Minister or where the Minister was recommending a particular consultant to be appointed, the matter was to be notified to the Secretary General of the Government, who would then set in motion a certain procedure.</P><Col N="712"/>
        <P>On how many occasions has the Secretary General to the Government been notified by a Minister in the circumstances I have described arising from the Quigley report?  How often has the Secretary General been notified of such appointments?</P>
        <P>In respect of the two public relations campaigns referred to by Deputy Kenny, Transport 21 and climate change, both of these are of no value whatever in terms of public information.  Their only value is the benefit of self promotion to the Ministers concerned.  Were those campaigns notified to the Secretaries General of the Departments before they were engaged in?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, they would not be because they do not involve direct service to the Minister in the way the Quigley report sets out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course they would.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was asked how many cases have been referred to the Government secretariat under the additional procedures.  Six cases coming within the terms of the guidelines have been processed so far.  Two of the cases related to the appointment of an arts adviser in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  My predecessor approved an appointment in 2005, following appropriate prior consideration by the Secretary General to the Government.  When the original post holder resigned, my predecessor approved the appointment of a successor to the post in 2006.</P>
        <P>In 2007, a case was noted by my predecessor following consideration by the Secretary General to the Government.  It related to an invitation to tender for consultancy work in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The work involved an examination of the possibility of developing a project that would lead to the establishment of an independent electoral commission.  I understand that the candidate concerned was subsequently unsuccessful in the tender competition.</P>
        <P>The three other cases which were referred to the Secretary General to the Government were, on consideration by him, found not to fall within the scope of the guidelines and so did not require consideration and approval.  The three cases related to the appointment of information technology, public relations and communications consultants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the last time the House discussed this matter on Question Time, approximately a year ago, his predecessor said the Quigley report, which was published in 2005, highlighted the need for additional care?  The then Taoiseach said that such attention is particularly needed in cases in which there may be a suggestion that a Minister or Minister of State might have an element of direct service through procurement arrangements in areas like public relations and communications.  Does the Taoiseach recall his predecessor&rsquo;s comment on that occasion that additional procurement procedures had been approved by the Government?  Are all such procedures now in place?  Are they being strictly adhered to?  Can the Taoiseach confirm that &euro;60 million was spent on public relations and consultancy services by the Departments in 2004, which is the last year for which I was able to dig out figures?  The Quigley report was published a year later, in 2005.  Does the Taoiseach have figures for the Government&rsquo;s expenditure on consultancy services in 2005, 2006 and 2007?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that this process was initiated on foot of concerns which were expressed about the close association between the Government parties, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il, and those involved in public relations and consultancy firms.  The House will recall that &euro;3.315 million was spent on such aspects of the launch of the electronic voting system, even though the roll-out of that system was later abandoned by the Government.  The companies <Col N="713"/>that benefited from those arrangements were Q4 Public Relations and McCann Erickson.  Is the Taoiseach aware that a former general secretary of Fianna F&aacute;il, Martin Mackin, and a former adviser to the Taoiseach, Jackie Gallagher, are directors of Q4 Public Relations?  Such details comprise the background to all of this matter.</P>
        <P>Can the Taoiseach give the House a clear indication that, since the publication of the Quigley report, there has been a stricter adherence to the rules set out in that report?  Has an effort been made to curtail the extent of the Government&rsquo;s engagement with external private consultancy firms?  Is there now a greater concentration on the Government press office and the individual press entities within Departments?  Is the Government less dependent on external agencies?  What is the intent of the new Taoiseach in this area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s questions relate to the implementation of the Quigley report.  I assure him that it is being implemented.  The report&rsquo;s recommendations were adopted by the Government and the Secretaries General of the various Departments were informed.  I explained the procedure in my initial reply.  That is that; that is the way it is.  It is a matter of ministerial choice.  I have observed people in successive Governments working with people within Departments and with people outside Departments.  It is a matter of personal choice.  Obviously it must be in line with approval of the Department of Finance regarding salary levels etc.  That is a transparent process.  I do not understand the reference to individuals who are engaged in business now.  They are subject to the same procurement arrangements as everyone else.  If they get the tender, they get it and if they do not get it, they do not get it.  I do not see the purpose of that intervention.  Anyway I do not question the professionalism of any of those people who may be employed from time to time by Departments to do specific jobs.  They have been employed by various Ministers of all parties from time to time where circumstances require them.  As the Deputy has said there are also skill sets within the public service which I, personally, have always utilised.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I return to the &euro;20 million being spent on public relations for Transport 21.  The Taoiseach tried to portray it as if &euro;20 million is not being spent on it.  My understanding is that over the period of that plan it is proposed to spend &euro;20 million on telling the people about the great plans for Transport 21.  I welcome what appears to be a reversal of policy here or a climb down, if one likes, when he said that no expenditure is allocated for the years from 2009 onwards.  I would welcome him taking the money back from the public relations and putting it into the 20 school buildings that have fallen off the back end of the waiting list.  I heard Deputy Quinn say here one night that the Department of Education and Science did not know how many prefabricated buildings were being used in schools in the country.  Instead of telling people who are stuck in traffic about the &euro;34 billion being spent on Transport 21, that money would be very welcome for school buildings.  If that is what he is saying, I welcome it and I will support him in transferring money from public relations about Transport 21 into much needed school buildings, where children in some places are going to schools in converted toilets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to come back to the reply the Taoiseach gave me that the Transport 21 and climate change advertisements did not come under the Quigley report, because he said they were not a service to the Ministers concerned.  What are they for?  Both those advertisements basically suggest we are marvellous to spend all this money on transport and to do all we are doing for climate change.  They are clearly political advertisements dressed up as some kind of public information.  What is the benefit of those advertisements to the public?  As the public are paying for them, what are they getting from the Transport 21 advertisements?  They add nothing to the value of public information and do not provide material information the public would want to have.  These advertisements are purely about promoting the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Taoiseach had indicated that special care needed to be exercised.  That was part of the intent of the Quigley report.  That is why I made the particular reference to individuals in public relations consultancy roles.  Special care needs to be exercised where they have strong associations &mdash; past or present &mdash; with the current Government parties.  In his reply the Taoiseach stated to me that it is up to the personal choice of individual Ministers and Departments.  Surely that is not what it should be.  Surely there should be a clear policy position of intent.  The Taoiseach should be indicating across the board that, in the first instance, there should be a dependency on each of the respective publicity offices, PROs, or whatever phraseology applies in the Departments, and on the Government press secretary, before any consideration is given to outside professional, paid PR consultancy firms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am simply making the point that the choice of press officer is a matter for the Minister and procedures and processes are in place by which that appointment is made.  The appointment can be internal or external.  I do not know what the Deputy&rsquo;s point is, but procurement rules and procedures are observed in all cases.  That is the way it is.  I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in would agree that past association should not be a disqualification for anybody.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 is an important infrastructural investment programme.  We are communicating to the public the progress of the projects.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that; it is public information.  We are reporting on the managing of impact during construction.  I am sure Members would decry in this House the fact that public information was not being made available about where construction was taking place at various interchanges.  A lot of good work has been done on the M50 and at other interchanges.  A proactive approach is being taken to let people know what is happening and how it will impact on them getting to work every morning.  I presume that is a public benefit.  We inform the public about possible disruption and the impacts of individual projects before they occur.</P>
        <P>We also have campaigns to increase awareness of public transport modes as we make the investments to make sure people are aware of them and will use them.  We have seen the benefit of that approach with the development of the Luas lines and the numbers who use public transport.  An extension of the Luas network is envisaged in Cherrywood and, I hope, in the docklands next year or the following year.  Important information needs to be provided to citizens on an ongoing basis about the impact of Transport 21 in terms of their own convenience, their ability to get to work and how those projects impact on their locality.  People are entitled to be made aware that the money is being well spent and that many of the projects are coming in within budget and on time or even before time.</P>
        <P>That is the thrust of what is being worked on, so that the public is made aware of the &euro;34 billion process and how it will interact in their daily lives.  That is the purpose of the ongoing campaigns.  In many respects they have been very good at that, especially, for example, in terms of the inconvenience to transport users coming to Dublin when major works were taking place at the Red Cow.  All of that work has to be communicated to the public and done in a professional way that is to their benefit.</P>

	<P>I had a constructive meeting on Friday, 9 May with my French counterpart, Michel Barnier.  We exchanged views on the ongoing WTO negotiations and it was clear that we had similar concerns about the lack of balance in the current situation and about the push for an early agreement, even though many important issues had yet to be resolved.  Both of us had serious misgivings about the negative impact of the current proposals on EU agriculture.  We agreed that it was important to communicate those concerns forcefully to the Commission and to build alliances with like-minded member states in support of our position.</P>
        <P>The meeting is one of a series of contacts concerning the WTO arranged with the Commission and my counterparts in other member states.  At yesterday&rsquo;s Agriculture Council of Ministers meeting I met the Agriculture Commissioner, Mrs. Fischer Boel, and I reiterated and highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s concerns to the Commission and to other member states, insisting that any WTO agreement must not place a disproportionate burden on EU and Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>I will continue also to ensure that Ireland plays a leading role in the group of 14-plus like-minded member states that have come together to express concerns on the direction of the WTO agriculture negotiations.  I am travelling to Slovenia next week where I will have bilateral discussions on the WTO with my colleagues from other member states.</P>
        <P>As to the veto, I remind Deputy Creed that the WTO negotiations are still in progress and there is no clarity as yet regarding either the eventual outcome or the timing of any deal.  In those circumstances, it is premature to speak in terms of a veto at this point.  Many aspects of the negotiations are still outstanding and we should not rush our fences.  The important point is to continue to fight strongly for a balanced deal that does not sacrifice agriculture.</P>
        <P>The House can rest assured that everything possible is being done, and at every political level, to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s interests are best protected in these negotiations.  I intend to spare no effort and to continue to work with other member states in the days and weeks ahead on the matter.</P>

	<P>At the outset I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Smith, on his appointment.  I look forward to working with him in the best interests of Irish agriculture and the agri-business sector.  I am sure I speak for my colleagues in that respect.  I also congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, on his appointment in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>I do not mean these comments to be personal but I read the press statement issued subsequent to the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting yesterday and regret the continuing clap-trap regarding the need for a balanced deal.  Farmers do not know what the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food means when it refers to a balanced deal.  What they want to hear, almost exclusively now in the context of the Lisbon treaty, is that if what is on the table now regarding tariff cuts of up to 70% in beef and high tariff cuts across other sectors also is the final deal presented by Commissioner Mandelson, first, that the veto is available as a political option for the Department to use and, second, that if what is on the table now is what will be put before the Minister and the Government to approve they will use the veto option.</P>

        <P>The Falconer paper was published last night but I had to attend a Government meeting and did not have an opportunity to read it yet but my officials will work on that immediately.  We will be involved in the consultative group as well in an early meeting regarding the most recent paper that has just been published.  We have major concerns about where we are in these negotiations.  Some of the proposals that originated from Geneva would have serious consequences for European Union agriculture.  For Ireland, the consequences of a bad deal would be particularly severe for the beef industry but other sectors such as dairy, sheepmeat and pigmeat will feel the impact also.  That is the reason we are so determined to fight this measure.</P>
        <P>As a trading country we are committed to the growth of international trade.  That is for the benefit of both the urban and the rural economies but we do not want a deal that will sacrifice agriculture.</P>
        <P>Deputy Creed, in the second part of his question and also in his supplementary, asked about the status of the veto.  Deputy Creed may not have had the opportunity to hear the Taoiseach confirm recently in the House, in answering a question from the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Enda Kenny, that we have the option on a veto but we are not at that stage.  We share the concerns of Members and the agricultural community in general.  The reality is the Commission is working to a mandate from the European Council and as Deputy Creed is aware, the Commissioner must work to that mandate on the agriculture side in line with the Council mandate.  That is the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>The unfortunate reality is that the Minister operates to a mandate from the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  The political failing of that Council of Ministers, the Minister and, more pointedly, his predecessor, was that they did not ensure the Commissioner did not stray beyond that brief, which he has done.  I am not aware if the Department or the Council of Ministers have a plan B which considers side deals or compensation measures for sectors within the agriculture industry, perhaps a &euro;300 suckler cow grant to compensate for it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s confirmation that the veto exists as a policy option, and I accept the Falconer paper published today, but if the options that were on the table up to now, which was the 70% cut in beef tariffs, the similar cuts in the dairy sector and across other sectors in the industry, are the ultimate proposals that will be put before the Irish Government to accept or reject, will the Government use the veto to reject them?</P>

        <Quest>  the steps he is taking to address growing food shortages; if he will convene a meeting with food and farming representative bodies to chart a plan going forward; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Increasing food prices and concerns regarding availability of food is a global situation, which is most severely affecting those people living in developing countries.  This complex issue has many causes, including recurrent bad weather and changing and increasing food requirements among countries caused in particular by economic and population growth.</P>
        <P>There is also an increasing global awareness that food security should not be taken for granted.  Agriculture has a vital role to play, both in meeting food requirements and renewable energy, and in managing scarce water and soil resources.  The critical role that agriculture plays highlights the continuing importance of the Common Agricultural Policy, which has all these concerns at its core.  I spoke on this very point at the Agriculture Council meeting yesterday.</P>
        <P>This underlines the role of Ireland as a major food exporting nation.  The 2003 reforms of the CAP, with the introduction of the full decoupling of direct payments under the single payment scheme, allows farmers to respond to the demands of the market and effectively meet consumers&rsquo; needs.  The issue of security of food supply will play an important role in discussions about the future shape of the CAP both in the health check and in the proposed discussions about the CAP after 2013.  Ireland will participate fully in those deliberations.  At a global level we will also be participating in a high level FAO conference on the subject of global food security next month.</P>
        <P>Although imports of certain commodities into the European Community may have increased, Ireland is a net exporter and is therefore not affected to the same extent as food deficit countries by global food shortages.  Bord Bia produces annual estimates for the export performance of the Irish food and drink sector and has indicated that the agri-food sector increased its level of exports by 5% in 2007 to over &euro;8.6 billion.  There was marked growth in the exports of dairy products, food ingredients, prepared foods, beverages, horticulture and cereals.</P>
        <P>It should be emphasised that there are in place a number of strategic plans operated by my Department which have the overall objective of developing and enhancing the capacity and competitiveness of the agriculture, food, forestry and fishing sectors.</P>
     
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
<P el="0">These include the Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan, the relevant commitments in Towards 2016, the national development plan and the rural development programme for the 2007-13 period, Steering a New Course, the seafood industry strategy, and the agriculture and marine research and development programmes in the national strategy for science, technology and innovation.  These plans were compiled taking into account the views of the industry, farming organisations and other major stakeholders and are regularly monitored to ensure the relevant commitments are met on an ongoing basis.</P><Col N="719"/>

	<P>On behalf of my party I join in congratulating the Minister on his appointment and also the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reason for the question is the degree of uncertainty which is having a marked result in this country in that we are now paying more for food.  Families are paying much more for staple items and that gives rise to the question.  If the WTO deal goes through as it is constituted, that will have a further uncertainty for food production throughout the European Union into the future.  Many people are asking whether the Government has a coherent policy.  Irish farmers and food producers will be asking whether that &euro;8.6 billion in exports will be compromised in any way if global trends continue as they are.  We are trying to elicit whether, notwithstanding the CAP health check and the FAO agenda on a global basis, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has a coherent strategy on the way forward for Irish producers to attain some degree of self-sufficiency &mdash; and ensure we take a long-term view on food production in Ireland.  That is the premise of the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Sherlock for his good wishes and look forward to working with him and our colleagues on all sides of the House. </P>
        <P>We export 80% of the food we produce in Ireland.  I was very glad that this particular issue was down for discussion yesterday at the Council of Ministers.  It reinforces once again the particular issues raised by Deputy Sherlock as regards the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We all recall that the second article of the Treaty of Rome was to ensure a secure supply of safe food for the citizens of Europe &mdash; and the CAP has provided that stability.  We are seeking additional milk quota from the health check, and we want simplification.  In the recent past, set-aside has literally been set aside.  There has been an increase in milk quota this year, and decoupling has been eased as well.  These are important concerns.  As regards the difficulties that emerged to date in the WTO negotiations, the reality is that this clearly demonstrates the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The health check is important now, and subsequently the CAP post-2013 will also be of extreme importance.  Of course, the world food shortage has hit the least well off worst in this scenario.  Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister acknowledge that if the WTO deal goes through as it is constituted at present, this will have a further adverse effect for producers in developing countries &mdash; as well as for Irish producers?  Ultimately, and this harks back to what the Fine Gael spokesman is saying as regards the current WTO deal, there are political considerations, both domestically and internationally.  Irish farmers want to hear that there will be no dismantling of the long-term achievements of CAP into the future.  It is clearly the case that the WTO deal, as it stands, will compromise those gains and indeed, diminish and destroy them.  They want to hear a firm voice from the Government as to its intentions on the WTO deal. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>We have been very strong supporters of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We want it strengthened and improved because we realise its value to Europe and for the Irish economy, farming and the agri-food industry.  We shall continue to highlight the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Perhaps we should also reflect on the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development aid has increased dramatically in recent years.  I believe we will contribute &euro;914 million this year.  Within the overseas development programme, it is very important that there is long-term development policy as regards agriculture &mdash; where the ben<Col N="720"/>eficiary countries are given the capacity, know-how and expertise to ensure they can grow basic foodstuffs for themselves.  That is the long-term solution to many of the terrible problems that exist in developing countries. </P>

        <Quest>  if in view of time constraints surrounding planning permission, the availability of contractors and health and safety concerns, he will extend the deadline for the completion of the farm waste management and farm improvement scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Creed and Sherlock for their good wishes. </P>
        <P>The revised farm waste management scheme was introduced by my Department in March 2006 in order to assist farmers meet the additional requirements of the nitrates directive.  Under the scheme, a standard grant-rate of 60% &mdash; 70% in the four zone C counties &mdash; is available to farmers who complete the required investment works.  The importance of this scheme for rural Ireland generally and for the protection of the environment cannot be overestimated and provides concrete evidence of the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to the agricultural sector in Ireland.  Some &euro;114 million was spent on the scheme in 2007 and payment claims substantially in excess of this figure are expected in 2008.</P>
        <P>The success of the scheme is evidenced by the fact that 48,580 applications were received from farmers before the closing date of end December 2006.  To date, more than 41,000 approvals have issued to farmers to commence work under the scheme.  The remaining applications have either been withdrawn, are awaiting the receipt of full planning permission or are explained by the receipt of multiple applications from a single farmer.  My Department is continuing to issue approvals on an ongoing basis as confirmation of the receipt of full planning permission is received from applicants and has already written to local authorities acknowledging the major contribution which they have made to this process and reminding them of the importance of the end-2008 deadline for completion of works under the scheme.</P>
        <P>The end-2008 deadline is a condition of the EU state aid approval governing the scheme, and I would urge farmers to complete the works and submit a payment claim to my Department by end-2008 so that they can qualify for the generous grants available.  The end-December 2008 deadline does not apply in the case of the farm improvement scheme, and farmers who are granted approval to commence work under that scheme are normally given a period of two years to complete the relevant investments.  I do not propose to alter these arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>I invite the Minister to take a look at his response in his spare time because he spends five minutes praising the scheme and gives the information requested in the question in the last 30 seconds. </P>
        <P>The highly-geared construction industry, in 2006, achieved something like 80,000 house units and we are expecting the agricultural construction sector to meet 40,000 applications under the farm waste management scheme in something like an 18 month period.  There is no way that deadline can be met.  Either thousands of farmers will lose out in terms of their financial entitlements under the scheme, or shortcuts will be taken.  As the former Minister of State with responsibility for health and safety, I am sure Deputy Killeen is aware of the dangers from on-farm accidents as well as accidents in the construction industry.</P><Col N="721"/>
        <P>I do not want to see, at the end of this year, farmers being exposed to dangers because of deadlines that are beyond their capacity and that of their agricultural contractors.  I implore the Minister of State to revisit this deadline before it is too late.  This sector simply does not have the capacity to deliver on that deadline &mdash; in terms of the ordering of galvanise, cubicles, slatted units, shuttering etc.  It simply is not possible to achieve the deadline at the end of this year.  I implore the Minister of State to recognise the problem at this early date and negotiate a realistic extension of the deadline.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Creed made the point that much of the information was contained in the last paragraph of my reply.  In fact, all the information about the numbers involved in the scheme is in the prior elements.  Two schemes, in fact, were mentioned in the question, the farm waste management and the farm improvement schemes.  The latter is not affected by the end of year deadline in this instance. </P>
        <P>The Deputy also makes the point about the health and safety element of the construction industry and this is obviously a requirement that needs to be adhered to, and in my view it can be, quite comfortably.  As regards the construction industry, the Deputy is right that in excess of 80,000 units were built in 2006 and the outturn for this year will probably be somewhere less than half that.  There has been considerable speculation as regards the numbers being made unemployed in the construction sector by spokesmen from his and other parties.  I do not have a concern therefore as regards manpower&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>In this instance, it is an enormously important scheme from an environmental viewpoint.  It is contributing hugely to the improvement of investment on farms and the environment.  I am satisfied that farmers who have their approvals will be in a position to complete the works. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State saying that at this stage he and his Department have no intention of seeking an extension?  I accept it is not entirely within his hands, for a concession to be granted.  However, does he expect that all of the applications on hand under the farm waste management scheme can be completed safely, to the appropriate standard, within that timeframe? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>All the evidence currently available to the Department suggests the works can be completed within the timescale.  It would be extraordinarily unhelpful to give any signal at this stage that the timescale was being reviewed, in view of the facts as outlined by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The national strategic plan for the Irish fisheries sector for the period 2007 to 2013 was prepared and approved by the Minister on 26 November 2007 and was subsequently submitted to the Commission on 28 November 2007.  The plan sets out a programme of support for fisheries in line with the seafood sector review group report, the Cawley report, Steering a New Course &mdash; Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish <Col N="722"/>Seafood Industry 2007-2013, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 28 January 2007.  The funding provisions for the strategy were set down in the National Development Plan 2007&ndash;2013.</P>
        <P>The Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara drew up an operational programme for fisheries for Ireland to implement the policies and priorities to be co-financed by the European Fisheries Fund.  This operational programme, submitted to the Commission on 6 March 2008, envisages the use of EU funds under the European Fisheries Fund to support the decommissioning of fishing vessels, aquaculture development and environmental and inshore fisheries support.  This only forms part of the commitment to support the sector as set down in the national development plan.</P>
        <P>As part of the normal consultative process for approval, the Commission adopts a negotiating position whereby it sets out its observations and recommendations with regard to improving the operational programme.  This negotiating position was received on 22 April 2008.  Officials from the Department met the Commission on 24 April as part of the formal process in the consideration of Ireland&rsquo;s operational programme.  The issues raised by the Commission were mainly procedural or editorial in nature.  Disappointment was expressed at the exclusion of measures under the Axis 4 pillar of the European Fisheries Fund in respect of &ldquo;sustainable development of fisheries areas&rdquo;.  At a meeting between the Commission and officials of the Department on 24 April, acknowledgement was given to our commitment for implementing these measures through State-aided funds, as outlined in the national strategic plan.  Notwithstanding this, the Commission continued to press for its inclusion under the operational programme.  The Commission also expressed concerns over Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of certain EU directives on the environment in the context of providing EU funding under the operational programme for aquaculture development.</P>
        <P>These issues are being dealt with interdepartmentally by officials from this Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Officials are fully engaged with the Commission with a view to bringing the consultation process to a successful conclusion and getting the operational programme approved as soon as possible.  The Commission&rsquo;s observations in that regard will be considered fully.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>On 22 April the Department was made aware that the operational programme was rejected.  I tabled a parliamentary question recently and the response suggested it was not so aware.  The former Minister stated that we face a bigger problem in that the operational programme for the fishing industry was rejected by the Commission.  It was rejected on 22 April, a month ago.  The Minister of State referred to meetings that have been held in the four weeks since the rejection.  What progress has been made since?  The former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food quite squarely laid the blame on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, yet the operational programme for fisheries falls within the remit of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, referred to the report on the habitats directive, the shellfish waters directive and the water framework directive.  I ascertain from this that considerable work must be done in this regard such that it will be acceptable to the Commission.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, referred to an interdepartmental group.  What progress has it made?  Ireland is the only country in Europe that does not have an operational programme for fisheries.  The Minister of State spoke about the Cawley report.  How can we possibly implement its recommendations?  It is almost June and half the year is nearly gone, yet no operational programme has been agreed and there is no money to be drawn from Europe.  This has implications, in respect of which I will quote the former Minister.</P>

It is not helpful to blame the Commission, Departments or various directorates general at Commission level.  The position is that Ireland is committed to delivering on the operational programme.  It is consulting the Commission and we intend to bring the discussions to a constructive conclusion as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The mixed grazing supplementary measure is available to farmers joining REPS 4.  Ultimately REPS is a voluntary, demand-led scheme and it is open to farmers to decide whether they want to take on the measure.  It is still too early to judge how popular it is.  On the basis of 3,800 applications for REPS 4 that were received and analysed by the end of last month, 240 applicants were opting for the mixed grazing measure.  Last Thursday, 15 May 2008, was the closing date for REPS 4 applications for this year.  When all applications have been processed, the position will become clearer.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>That was concise.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>All the more time for the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>All the more time for me.  It is safe to say that when all the information is gathered on the &euro;28 million promised in 2007, it will be found that only &euro;900,000 had been drawn down by May 2008.  It is safe to say there will be a sizeable surplus.  Given that the only other measure applicable to sheep farmers was contained in the farm improvement scheme, which has been closed prematurely, there is surely room for manoeuvre.</P>
        <P>In many ways, the mixed grazing initiative has been unworkable for many sheep farmers, not least because of the mixed grazing requirement <i>per se</i>.  Many affected farmers have no conduit of funding other than through sheep farming because of the nature of the landscape on which they work.  To have mixed grazing, they would have to have bovines and provide wintering facilities, which they were not enabled to do, to comply with their REPS 4 obligations and meet the environmental concerns.  I ask that there be a little lateral thinking.  There is probably at least &euro;27 million remaining of the &euro;28 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>That is if it ever existed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The initiative was announced on 16 May 2007, as were some others.  We must be a little circumspect in this regard.  I am sure there is at least &euro;27 million left and a little lateral thinking would allow it to be ring-fenced for the target group for which it was said to be intended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Considerable lateral thinking has informed the background to the scheme.  The Deputy will be aware that it was made very clear in the discussions with the Commission that the scheme is an environmental scheme, not a production scheme.  We tried to include the sheep-only option but it was a step too far from the Commission&rsquo;s point of view because it wanted to ensure the measure was clearly environmental.</P>
        <P>The scheme is demand-led and it is therefore a question of ensuring take-up on the basis of demand.  The Deputy probably read the front page of the farming supplement of the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning, as I did, and, if so, he will have noted that the reduction in sheep numbers is part of a bigger picture associated with the move from dry stock to tillage.  There are also other factors, despite the ironic fact that stock prices have increased.  This is perhaps because of supply and demand as much as any other factor.  Consumption is reducing in our greatest export market, France.</P>
        <P>There are broader questions to be answered with which it is not possible to deal in respect of REPS 4.</P>
        <P>The timing of the question is greatly ahead of the Department&rsquo;s ability to evaluate the exact position.  While one may speculate on the number of applications, the reason the answer was so short is it is not possible to provide much information at present until the information has been analysed in greater detail.  At present, the Department is obliged to take account of the Commission&rsquo;s assertion this must be an environmental scheme, rather than a production assistance scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>When the scheme was announced, it was stated that &euro;28 million was available.  I accept some lateral thinking took place.  Incidentally, I contend that aid to stock-proofing, which is contained in the farm improvement scheme pertains to health security, especially in respect of disease transmission etc.  It also has environmental issues.  However, when arriving at the figure of &euro;28 million, some background studies must have been done to establish this was the amount of money required and that the target group could draw it down.</P><Col N="725"/>
        <P>For various reasons, the schedule of payments for REPS 4 was a major issue at the outset and delayed uptake of the scheme.  It certainly delayed the transfer of people from REPS 3 to REPS 4.  Considerable research must have been done to establish that &euro;28 million was needed.  No matter how many people enter the scheme, the estimate was off the mark and the final figures, whenever they are collated, will differ greatly from it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of &euro;9,000 has been paid out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>

        <Quest>  the number of privately owned hectares of forestry in each of the past 20 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of privately owned hectares of forestry planted in each of the past 20 years has been set out in tabular format and will be included in the Official Report.  It ranges from 2,954 hectares in 1987 to 6,947 hectares last year.  I fully acknowledge the contribution made to the forestry sector to date by private landowners and farmers with the vision to adopt forestry as a viable land use option.  I am eager to ensure that even greater numbers will continue to do so in the future.</P><Col N="726"/>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to forestry as evidenced by the allocation of &euro;126 million this year to further the national afforestation programme.  At present, approximately 15,000 farmers and landowners are enjoying the financial and other benefits brought about by their involvement in the afforestation programme.  For example, in March the Department paid out &euro;52 million to private farm foresters in respect of their annual forestry premiums.  This represents a significant cash injection into the rural economy.</P>
        <P>Since the significant State and EU supported afforestation schemes came into operation in the early 1980s, more than 226,000 hectares of privately owned forest has been established.  I am committed to building on this significant achievement and encouraging further private landowner participation in forestry.</P>

	<P>Although the target is 10,000 hectares per annum, the Minister of State has stated the planting programme has declined in recent years, falling as low as 6,000 hectares last year.  While the current planning obligation certainly is deterring farmer planting, I will return to this point in the next question to be taken.  The planting threshold of eight hectares is too high.  I understand it is clear, from the applications in hand in the forestry service, the present scheme simply is not attractive to farmers in the west of Ireland or in other areas in which farm sizes tend to be smaller.  On the other end of the scale&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the tiered structure makes the forest environment protection scheme, FEPS, less attractive on larger REPS farms.  The fact that unenclosed land cannot be planted also is restricting the scheme from large areas in the country.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sheehan will be aware of the Malone report, which examined all of the issues mentioned by him, as well as a number of other issues that affect the acreage being afforested each year.  The report contains 18 principal recommendations, some of which are being implemented at present and some of which refer to the FEPS programme.  One recommendation, which specifically proposed the reduction of the minimum area to be planted from eight to five hectares, is being implemented at present.  In addition, a working group is to be established in fulfilment of one of the main recommendations and the Department looks forward to working closely with it to deal with the issues raised by Deputy Sheehan and others to try to ensure the target rate of planting can be achieved.</P>

	<P>The legislation will examine this issue, as well as a considerable number of other issues.

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>

	<P>Following a comprehensive review of the Forestry Act 1946, the heads of a proposed forestry Bill have been drafted and submitted to me for consideration.  I am studying the implications of the Bill and hope to be in a position to present it to the Government shortly.  I hope to publish the forestry Bill in the autumn.</P>
        <P>The main objective in proposing a new forestry Bill is to introduce one principal Act, which will consolidate and update existing forestry legislation in the light of modern forestry knowledge and practice.  The comprehensive legislative framework provided by the forestry Bill will support the development of a modern, multifunctional high-quality forestry sector.</P>
        <P>Among the principal features of the Bill will be the introduction of a simpler and more streamlined felling licence system, the provision of a statutory basis for forestry guidelines and forest management plans, as well as provisions to enhance the protection of forests and plant health.  It also is proposed to take a more flexible approach regarding the question of replanting after harvesting.  However, the general principle of replanting after felling will remain to ensure that the national forest estate is maintained.  The Bill will address many of the issues raised during the consultation process undertaken by the Department over the last number of years.</P>
        <P>The overall thrust of the Bill is to provide for the development of forestry in a manner which maximises the economic, environmental and social value of forests within the principles of sustainable forest management.  It will ensure that the best structures are in place for the development and efficient operation of the forest industry, the proper management of forests after planting and the protection and enhancement of the environment.</P>

I look forward to working with them and have known both of them for some time.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As for the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, is he stating there has been no progress since the former Minister answered a similar question tabled by me in November 2007?  This Bill has been in gestation since May 1998.  I wish it a happy tenth anniversary, as ten years have passed since this Bill was first focused upon in 1998.  While an elephant only takes 22 months to gestate and deliver her baby, ink has not been put to paper in respect of this Bill after ten years.  This constitutes another fine example of paralysis by analysis.  Is it not time this Bill was published?  Will it be out of date by the time it is published?  This measure seeks to update the Act of 1946, which is over 60 years old.</P>
      
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s party used the phrase &ldquo;a lot done, more to do&rdquo; in 2002.  That was six years ago and this Bill is a case of &ldquo;we have not seen a lot and we do not know how much more there is to do&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>

	<P>As with any regime change, one would hope there are plans for <i>force majeure</i> events.  This has been ten years in the making.</P>
        <P>I welcome the clear statement and, frankly, I hope it is true.  This legislation was on the Order Paper when I came into this House, then it was taken off and it has appeared again.  The confusion relating to this is genuine and, from the point of view of a spokesperson on agriculture, there has been no legislation on agriculture, fisheries, forestry or food in the past 12 months.  For this reason I hope the statement is genuine and I look forward to the legislation.</P>

	<P>The farm improvement scheme, FIS, was introduced by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in July 2007 with funding of &euro;79 million, as agreed under the partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  The scheme was suspended on 31 October 2007 as applications received had reached this level of funding.  It was specifically made clear, at the time of its launch, that the scheme would be terminated when this financial ceiling had been reached and this was also specifically provided for in the terms and conditions of the scheme.  Some 12,675 applications were received from farmers prior to the closing date of the scheme. </P>
        <P>These applications are being processed within the Department up to the level of funding made available for the scheme in the above-mentioned partnership agreement.</P>

	<P>I congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, on his elevation to the office of Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I wish him the best and assure him that I will give all the positive and constructive help I can.  I also congratulate Deputy Killeen on his appointment as Minister of State at that Department.</P>
        <P>This scheme is very important, as the Minister, who comes from a county with a similar structure to mine, knows.  The problem here arises due to applications that were lodged in departmental offices that do not use the computer system.  Those applications are not, as yet, recognised.  What is the legal situation of a person who has lodged an application in an office but has not been assured whether it will be taken?  This is a major problem facing many farmers who do not know whether to proceed with projects of various sizes under their own steam or wait to see what will happen.  Will the Minister advise when this group will know if the scheme is to be reopened?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Crawford for his good wishes.  He took the opportunity in other fora, in the constituency and elsewhere, to convey them to me.  </P><Col N="730"/>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, 12,675 applications were received from farmers under the FIS by the closing date, 31 October 2007.  These applications are being processed up to the level of funding available.  Applications received up to 31 October 2007 are being processed first and any funding that remains after they have been processed will be applied to the remaining applications.</P>
        <P>As I said in my initial reply, it was outlined in the scheme and the press release accompanying its launch that &euro;79 million was available for it.  Some &euro;6 million was available for the sow housing scheme at the time.  In the partnership agreement, Towards 2016, a commitment was made to provide &euro;85 million for this investment sector.  It also provides for a review of its terms during 2008; this will provide an opportunity to reassess the financial terms of the agreement.  It was made clear previously that the farm improvement scheme will not be reopened prior to a review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to this matter and Deputy Creed&rsquo;s point on processing, the faults may lie with a lack of staff in local offices.  Deputy Crawford has outlined a case where the computer system was inactive.  I know of a specific case in the local office in my constituency where there is a lack of staff.  Responses from the Minister and the Department indicate that people have been recruited to update matters and attempt to catch up with FIS and the farm waste management scheme.  These delays will put pressure on finality dates to comply with the terms and conditions of grant aid.  Construction cannot take place if approval is not granted.  There is planning permission but departmental approval has not been given due to staff constraints in offices and computer problems.</P>

	<P>In light of the fact that in recent years the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has underspent by millions and sent money back, will the Minister examine the possibility of adding extra funds to this scheme?

        <QRef>[19544/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland holds a very important position as custodian of some of the largest and richest fishing waters within the EU and in our location on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.  Ireland continues to maintain high standards in the enforcement of regulations within the exclusive fisheries zone using the resources of the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority. </P>
        <P>Systems for dealing with infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy vary greatly among member states and useful comparisons are not easily drawn.  Many continental legal systems are different from that of Ireland and lend themselves to a structure of administrative fines and penalties.  Previous advice from the Attorney General indicated that under the Irish legal system the types of penalty Ireland is obliged to apply under the Common Fisheries Policy would be viewed as criminal in nature and, therefore, could only be administered by the courts by virtue of Articles 34, 37 and 38 of the Constitution.  Administrative fines for fisheries offences could be introduced in Ireland if this were a requirement under European law.  I am supportive of any positive proposals from the Commission in this regard.</P>
        <P>Under the current legislation, the Sea-fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, all sanctions are purely financial in nature.  The Act simply sets down the maximum fines that may be applied.  No minimum fine is set and it is a matter for a judge, taking into account the specific case, to determine the actual fine levied.  The Act also applies for the first time a scaled approach to setting maximum fines, whereby the maximum fines set for smaller vessels are less than those for larger vessels.  In that respect, the 2006 Act sought to guarantee a degree of proportionality for fines based on vessel size, a factor which did not exist in previous legislation.</P>
        <P>The Department is currently reviewing the operation of sanctions under the Act in light of experience since its enactment.  Officials of the Department will be consulting with, among <Col N="732"/>others, industry representatives, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the Office of the Attorney General in the course of this review.  The recent changes introduced by the UK authorities, whereby administrative sanctions have been introduced for a small number of minor offences, will also be considered as part of this review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I make a strong plea to the new Minister on this issue.  He will possibly recall the rather bruising debate we had a couple of years ago on the Sea-fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill.  There are two aspects of this issue that I ask the Minister to bear in mind.  The fishing community genuinely feels its members are being tagged as criminals for committing very minor offences.  In addition, major costs were imposed on them due to the locking up of their boats in port while they attended court, as well as other costs and expenses.  Does the Minister accept the opinion of the EU Commissioners, who recorded a view that administrative sanctions can be an effective way of increasing compliance?</P>
        <P>Over the past 12 months there have been regular meetings on this issue among the UK Administrations in Whitehall, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Earlier this year, the Scottish authorities introduced a new regime, under the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Act 2007 (Fixed Penalty Notices) Order 2008, which allows for administrative sanctions.  Leaving aside the bruising battles of the past, would the Minister accept there is a way around the Attorney General&rsquo;s concerns on the basis of consent?  Will the Minister keep an open mind and talk to the fishing community and interested parties with a view to finding a decent solution to this problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend to meet all interests in this sector as soon as possible.  The first meeting, which will be attended by me and the Minister, Deputy Smith, takes place on Thursday.  The Deputy and others in the House will accept that penalties must be a deterrent and must be dissuasive.  To this end, they must involve depriving the wrongdoer, at a minimum, of the benefits of his or her action.  Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, more than most, will be aware of the provisions and implications of Articles 34, 37 and 38 of the Constitution in this regard.  As I said, all options are being considered.  It is not necessarily the case, in this instance, that administrative fines would be better for people who are guilty of minor offences.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>We seem to be the best Europeans in the Union.  Not only are we implementing the EU regulations, but we are penalising our fishermen more severely than any other member state.  No other member state imposes criminal sanctions on its fishermen for these offences.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I am sure there is a question coming.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was no stipulation from the European Union to criminalise Irish fishermen.  Why did the Government implement such a rash measure on our fishing skippers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct that there was no such stipulation from the EU, but there was a stipulation regarding the level of fine to be imposed which, because of the implications of Articles 34, 37 and 38, had the effect to which the Deputy refers.  All of this is <Col N="733"/>being considered.  The Minister and I will engage with the industry and we will try to address these issues to the greatest extent possible.</P>

At that stage, according to staff at University College Hospital, Galway, plans were immediately put in place for her treatment.  Why has she not received this treatment to date?

	<P>Last year, we witnessed the scandal of misdiagnoses of cancer in women in Portlaoise.  Following the unearthing of that scandal we had the usual reports from the Minister for chaos in health that this matter would be rectified and that lessons had been learned.  We were told management and governance would be improved and that communications failures would be ended.  We were promised that new protocols and rapid responses <Col N="734"/>would be put in place and that there would be no more miscommunications of information.  Let us consider what happened recently in the north east.</P>
        <P>The HSE became aware of misdiagnoses in the north east last November, at the height of the scandal in Portlaoise.  In March 2008, when this matter was brought to the notice of the public by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd and others, the HSE played it down and said that CT scans were not part of the review.  Last week, six months after the misdiagnoses were first uncovered, a bombshell was dropped on the people of the north east.  We were told that 6,000 X-rays and 70 CT scans were being reviewed.  Not only that, but the communications were completely and utterly botched.  Despite the fact that there are more than 100,000 people working in the HSE, this matter was outsourced to a company.  Some patients received part of their correspondence, while some received their own correspondence and correspondence for other people.  Letters were sent to persons who were deceased, which is absolutely scandalous and upsetting for their families.</P>
        <P>For example, there is the case of Anne Kealy.  In March 2007 she went for a CT scan and was told she had pneumonia.  She went to hospital and contracted MRSA.  When she was still unwell five weeks later, her family demanded a new scan.  That scan showed that Anne Kealy had cancer in her kidney, lungs and brain.  Anne Kealy got two letters last week.  The letter she received on 14 May stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The x-rays and scans [. . .] will be carefully re-examined by an expert team of radiologists who are carrying out this look back review. . . . [B]ased upon expert medical advice it is our expectation that in the vast majority of cases there will be no cause for concern.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It went on to say:</P>
        <P LI="1">[I]f you are reading this letter and are not the addressee, we very much regret any distress this letter may cause you and your family.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Anne Kealy died in August 2007.  She received two letters this week.</P>
        <P>Does this not amount to a cluster bomb of offences?  It is a cluster bomb of incidents of mismanagement and further mismanagement over which the Minister for Health and Children, who was re-appointed last week by the Taoiseach, presides.  Is the Taoiseach, as a long-standing Deputy and Minister, not ashamed of this situation?  We were told last year that lessons had been learned, that new protocols would be put in place and that such a situation would never recur.  Why has it taken six months to act in this matter?  Why was the family of Ms Anne Kealy subjected to this type of treatment?  How many more Anne Kealys have passed away in the meantime due to misdiagnoses and misinformation presided over by the Government and the re-appointed Minister for Health and Children?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the question of 4,500 cases, it can unfortunately be the case that, through human error, an issue such as this can arise.  It is to be regretted and responsibility for it must be taken by the company concerned.  The review of 4,500 cases and more than 6,000 <Col N="735"/>X-rays is a precautionary measure in line with best practice based on the advice received by the HSE from people in this area.  The total review of the locum&rsquo;s work was necessary.</P>
        <P>It is important to ensure that people&rsquo;s anxieties are dealt with as quickly and professionally as possible.  It will take approximately eight weeks before the last of the X-rays and CAT scans are reviewed and confirmed as being in order based on the previous understanding of the situation.  It is important that, where errors occurred under the locum, matters such as the one that arose in 2006 and 2007 be dealt with and that the precautionary principle be applied.  That 6,000 X-rays are being examined is not to suggest that the same level of danger applies in each case.  Rather, a precautionary principle is being applied in 4,500 cases.  It is important we recognise this and allow the HSE to conduct its work as quickly and professionally as possible in a way that seeks to minimise people&rsquo;s anxieties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate the new Taoiseach must be required to continue where his predecessor finished in apologising continually for a litany of mismanagement affecting people&rsquo;s lives and the sensitivities of their families.  The Government accepted the Harding Clark findings to the effect that a new system should be put in place to deal with this issue.  While the Taoiseach states it is a question of human error, the company selected by the hospital sent second letters claiming the problem was due to an internal process.</P>
        <P>The late Anne Kealy&rsquo;s case highlights what has gone wrong.  We were told one thing by the absent Minister for chaos and health &mdash; that new systems would be put in place and that such miscommunications would never recur &mdash; but Ms Kealy, who went to hospital, had a scan and was told she had pneumonia, was told after another scan five weeks later that she had lung, kidney and brain cancer.  She received two letters before dying.  In 2008, &euro;15 billion is being spent on a system that carries on in this way and experiences a litany of incidents every day of the week.</P>
        <P>The review to which the Taoiseach referred states that eight weeks will pass before the final scans will be determined.  The process will be completed eight months after the first patient was known to have been misdiagnosed.  The House is aware that, after the bombshell in Portlaoise, the Minister for Health and Children appeared in the Chamber because her head was on the line and arranged for clinics that weekend.  We saw them on television.  What happens to the people in the north east?  They are expected to wait eight weeks for the assessment of scans and X-rays.</P>

While the people in the north east must wait eight weeks, the people in the midlands had clinics that weekend because the Minister&rsquo;s political head was on the line.  Those in the north east are not waiting eight weeks.  Rather, they are attending their general practitioners and presenting at accident and emergency units to have scans and X-rays done.  I agree with this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday, a major developer, the McNamara-Castlethorn consortium, withdrew from five public private partnerships with Dublin City Council for the regeneration of several areas of the city, including St. Michael&rsquo;s estate in Inchicore, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Dominick Street, Infirmary Road and Se&aacute;n McDermott Street.  These projects involved the provision of more than 1,000 social and affordable housing units, along with community and neighbourhood facilities, in an effort to regenerate and revitalise areas which are among the most disadvantaged not only in Dublin city, but in the State.  Much work was done over a seven-year period in bringing forward these regeneration schemes.  This involved consulting with the communities themselves and with the wider neighbourhoods to agree the schemes that were eventually devised.  In anticipation of the work, a considerable amount of detenanting has taken place within those areas.  In O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, for example, four of the 14 blocks have been detenanted.  Similar levels of detenanting have taken place in the other estates.</P><Col N="739"/>
        <P>The people living in these estates are absolutely devastated that their hopes for the regeneration of their homes and neighbourhoods are now dashed.  Several questions arise.  What can the Taoiseach say to the people living on these estates and whose hopes have been so badly damaged by yesterday&rsquo;s announcement?  What hope can he offer them that the regeneration will proceed as planned?  What alternative arrangements will be put in place to ensure this is so?  Why was the same developer awarded the contract for all these schemes?</P>
        <P>What penalty clauses, if any, were attached to the contract which allow the developer to withdraw at this late stage?  As we said last week during an exchange of opinions on this area, public private partnership should not only exist when times are good.  The concept includes the idea that the partnership should also be there when times are tightening.  It should not be the case that the Exchequer takes all the risk and the developer pulls out when the situation gets trickier.  Are we likely to see the plug being pulled in coming weeks or months on any other public private partnerships in which either this or other developers are engaged?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide me with a report on this matter arising from yesterday&rsquo;s developments.  I will answer Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s questions to the best of my ability.  I acknowledge that this is a setback for those communities who have been working hard in conjunction with the city council to devise regeneration plans for their areas.  These are areas where we would like to see improvements and regeneration take place.</P>
        <P>Following the withdrawal of the developer from the public private partnership projects in question, I understand members of the regeneration board had a meeting with city council officials yesterday.  Despite this setback, there is a continuing commitment on the part of the council to prioritise the prospect of regeneration for these communities.  This may involve approaching other developers who have indicated an interest in participating in public private partnership.  The public private partnership contracts with the developer are not available to me and I am not in a position to answer questions about the details of those contracts.  However, I will seek to find some information on this for the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to the detenanting that has taken place in these areas.  The need to provide housing for these people as quickly as possible, whether through a reactivation of the public private partnership process in conjunction with a different developer or via a phased development based on a more traditional procurement method, is a priority for the city council.  That is a matter for consideration by Dublin City Council officials as they seek to assess where they go from here and decide the next steps in dealing with this setback.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The difficulty is that the physical conditions in the estates in question are probably worse as a consequence of the detenanting that has taken place.  We do not want a situation where people must continue living in poor physical conditions and in circumstances where the hopes they had for the regeneration of their homes and neighbourhoods are entirely dashed.  I hope arrangements will be put in place quickly to ensure these schemes proceed without delay.</P>
        <P>Are we likely to hear other news about public partnership projects in conjunction with the same or other developers?  For example, will the Finglas village project, in which I understand the same developer is involved, proceed as planned or will the plug be pulled on that also?  I notice a proposal has been withdrawn from the D&aacute;il Order Paper in respect of the building of the prison at Thornton Hall.  I understand the same developer is the proposed builder of Thornton Hall prison.  That proposal was to have been brought before the D&aacute;il today and tomorrow for approval but I note it has been withdrawn.  Is the developer proceeding with the Thornton Hall prison or has there been a change in that regard?  Does yesterday&rsquo;s announce<Col N="740"/>ment regarding projects in Dublin city have implications for the developer&rsquo;s involvement with that project?  More generally, what are the implications for the public private partnership method of providing social and public infrastructure?  Yesterday&rsquo;s events will certainly dent the confidence of public authorities engaging with developers on projects of this kind if the plug is so easily pulled at the last minute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Since this arose yesterday, no further suggestion has been made beyond those which are in the public domain.  At this stage, I await a report from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on his assessment of the full situation as best he can gauge it.  It is only fair to say that PPP models differ.  These projects involved Dublin City Council leveraging the grounds it owned by means of a PPP so that residential social and affordable housing could be built in addition to other mixed developments which would be sold on by the developer to help finance the construction of social and affordable housing to meet the requirements of existing tenants and occupiers.  The intention is to bring about regeneration and a greater community spirit not only in terms of residential housing but also by developing other much needed facilities for the area.  That model was applied in Fatima Mansions and other successful projects which have been seen to bring a lot of added value and helped to restore and support the communities in these areas.</P>
        <P>The Thornton Hall project involves a different PPP model based on the construction of the prison and staged annualised payments thereafter.  I have received no indication from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the project has stalled.  We are at an advanced stage of the process, although I understand it has not yet been finalised.  An additional purpose of that proposal is to facilitate the development of prison complexes in the inner city which will greatly enhance the quality of life for people living there.</P>
        <P>To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question as best I can, as of today, I am not aware that any further issues have arisen but that will become clearer when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has an opportunity to assess the situation.  The Thornton Hall project involves a different model and is not complete at this stage in respect of the PPP issue.  Specific issues arise in respect of the residential aspect, market conditions etc., which are impinging upon the viability of this project as it stands.  The issue now for tenants and Dublin City Council is to take the next step by working with the local regeneration boards on determining whether other developers can become interested in completing the project as envisaged and the extent to which traditional procurement of housing by local authorities in those areas can be part of the solution.</P>
        <P>In regard to those who may wish to be de-tenanted to live in better conditions pending the development of their areas, I am sure that process can continue.  As Deputy Gilmore noted, not all the areas have been de-tenanted and that varies from estate to estate.  These are issues which Dublin City Council will consider.  I note the council continues to contend this is a priority for it.  We are spending just less than &euro;1.5 billion annually on social housing, over &euro;200 million of which has been allocated to Dublin City Council.  The council&rsquo;s housing programme contains a multi-annual commitment to housing which is very considerable, and rightly so.  We will have to determine what this setback means for the projects and whether they can be reconfigured or if traditional procurement will have to play some part in the rehousing process.</P>

	<P>When will the Bill relating to long-stay institutions be forthcoming?  Is it still on track for production in the near future?  If I recall correctly the comments of the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the sale of alcohol Bill, which has been promised for some time, was to have been introduced by the end of March.  When is the Bill likely to be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The sale of alcohol Bill is due later this year.  The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated that he expected the intoxicating liquor Bill, which is a <Col N="744"/>shorter item of legislation, to appear before the end of the summer.  The Bill relating to long-stay institutions is still expected to be published this session.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The shorter Bill to which the Taoiseach refers is that which the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated would be introduced by the end of March.  Is the Taoiseach stating that it will be introduced before the end of the summer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated he was to receive a report from the relevant committee, which is chaired by Mr. Holmes, by the end of March.  The report was duly received.  The former Minister then indicated that rather than incorporating it into the longer Bill he would perhaps devise a shorter one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When will that be forthcoming?</P>

	<P>The Order of Business announced by the Taoiseach represents the fourth draft of the business which was to be conducted today.  Since Thursday last, we have been supplied with four different schedules of business for this week.  It is extremely difficult to keep up with the Government, which appears to be changing its mind to such an extent regarding the business to be conducted in the House.  This type of behaviour is unfair to Opposition spokespersons who are not quite as well resourced as Ministers.</P>
        <P>A motion regarding the prison at Thornton Hall was due to be taken tomorrow.  I understand it was withdrawn because it was realised, belatedly, that Opposition justice spokespersons and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform were to be engaged in other business at the relevant committee.  When will the motion to which I refer be brought before the House?</P>
        <P>The second schedule of business with which we were supplied indicated that the Second Stage debate on the Ethics in Public Office Bill was to resume.  This legislation caused some difficulties to the Green Party previously as a result of the its containing provision to increase the thresholds for disclosure by Members of the Oireachtas for gifts they receive and the shares etc. they hold.  Is the Government proceeding with the Ethics in Public Office Bill?  If so, when will it come before the House?</P>
        <P>When will the civil partnership Bill be introduced?  The heads of the Bill were to have been received by the end of March.  However, the Bill has not appeared.  Will the Taoiseach indicate which Minister will be introducing the Bill when it is eventually brought forward?</P>

	<P>As I stated last week to the Deputy&rsquo;s leader on the matter, they are not suitable in every case.  They are suitable and appropriate in some cases.  With the level of direct Exchequer provision being finite by definition, however great it is, the public private partnership provides another prospect of increasing the level of activity and work than would otherwise be the case if we constrained ourselves to direct Exchequer provision.  That is also a fact.</P>

        <P>I welcome the opportunity to commence this debate on the OECD&rsquo;s report on its review of the public service.  The report, Towards an Integrated Public Service, marks the culmination of 16 months of work by the OECD, which involved intensive analysis and extensive consultation.  Members of the Oireachtas were consulted in their roles as chairs of a number of committees, members of such committees and party spokespersons.  This substantive report is widely recognised as an authoritative assessment of the current state of the public service.  It has been accepted as such by the Government.  The OECD has outlined in depth the strengths of our current system.  More importantly, it has outlined the disconnects and challenges that must be addressed if the public service is to meet the needs and expectations of our citizens.  The OECD acknowledges that the public service is on a sound path of modernisation.  It believes that our relatively small public sector has contributed to our competitive advantage.  However, it acknowledges that there is an insufficient focus on performance that delivers outcomes in line with the needs of citizens.  It correctly categorises our public service reform process as being inward-facing and overly focused on processes and procedures, without sufficiently demonstrat<Col N="753"/>ing that it is driven by the complex and diverse needs of citizens or focused on making a difference to the quality of their lives.</P>
        <P>The OECD&rsquo;s main recommendation is that we should think about the public service as a more integrated system.  An integrated public service means getting people in the various parts of the system to work in a more consistent, co-ordinated and networked way across traditional sectoral and organisational boundaries.  It does not necessarily mean changing the structure of the public service or changing the existing number of offices or agencies.  It involves ensuring that Departments, offices and agencies interact with each other in new ways and providing for integrated action in policy making, delivery and implementation.  It will require greater pooling and sharing of information, data and resources, a common pursuit of objectives and greater governance of State agencies, offices and bodies under the aegis of Departments.</P>
        <P>The report recognises the value of the extensive reform efforts which have been undertaken to date in areas like customer service, e-Government, human resources, financial management and better regulation.  The positive results of the change and reform programme in the quality customer service area can be seen by citizens.  Management and organisational reforms introduced via the performance management development system have resulted in better functioning individual organisations.  The OECD recognises that the dividend from many of these reforms will be fully harvested as they become increasingly embedded.  Having said that, the OECD clearly believes we can and should do better.  Despite the significant improvements and reforms which have been introduced, many challenges remain.  The past decade has seen increases in public service expenditure and employee numbers.  Expectations for improved service delivery, greater efficiency and better performance from our public service have increased.  The OECD has indicated that if we can sequence future reforms in a better way, we can improve performance and service delivery and achieve greater efficiencies.  Many of the reform initiatives which have been introduced to date have focused largely on the Civil Service, which comprises just one tenth of the public sector, as opposed to the broader public service.</P>
        <P>The public sector is required to review its systems, processes and procedures continuously to ensure they are responsive and efficient.  The public service needs to provide high quality services which represent value for money.  Citizens need to be sure the public service will deliver the services they expect when needed, where needed and as needed.  The OECD has clearly highlighted the need to put the public at the centre of our public services.  The public service modernisation process needs to deliver results that are clear, useful and verifiable to the user.  A number of initiatives which are in place are addressing many of the challenges identified in the OECD report.  I intend to pursue a comprehensive programme of renewal which integrates these initiatives and moves us towards a world-class public service that is equipped to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform this House that today I am appointing a task force to develop an action plan for the public service to report to Government before the end of the summer.  This task force will be chaired by the Secretary General to the Government.  Its membership will include four external members: Mark Ryan, country managing director, Accenture; John Moloney, group managing director, Glanbia plc; Breege O&rsquo;Donoghue, director, Penneys Primark; and Paul Haran, principal, College of Business and Law, UCD; as well as four Secretaries General, the Secretary General responsible for public service management at the Department of Finance and the Secretaries General of the Departments of Health and Children, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the task force are to prepare for consideration by Government a comprehensive framework for renewal of the public service, which takes into account the analysis and conclusions of the OECD report, Towards an Integrated Public Service, as well as <Col N="754"/>the lessons to be drawn from the strategic management initiative, the organisational review programme, and the efficiency review process, and to recommend in particular how best to secure an overarching policy for an integrated public service that enables increased flexibility mobility and staff development, supports the competencies and practices necessary for new network ways of working within and across the broad public service; and how to secure the basis for determining the contribution which a senior public service could make to an integrated and cohesive public service.</P>
        <P>The task force is also being asked to outline a set of criteria to inform the way in which the business of Government is structured and organised, with a strategy to enable necessary changes to be planned and implemented successfully; and the benefits of greater use of shared services across all sectors of the public service.  One example of successful shared services currently in operation is the Killarney financial shared services centre.  It provides financial services for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and eight other client organisations, including my Department.  The task force is also being asked to outline an appropriate framework for the establishment and operation and governance of State agencies.  In this regard, the OECD recommends putting in place a formal performance dialogue between Departments and agencies and the Department of Finance.  This would entail a process of setting different types of targets and evaluation, and making links between inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the task force is being asked to develop a strategy by which e-Government delivers coherent and citizen-focused services and more closely supports greater efficiency in administrative processes; and an implementation plan, specifying the tasks and responsibilities necessary for the successful implementation of the renewal agenda, including the ways in which the principle of partnership with public servants and their representatives will be applied.  The task force will complete its work by the end of the summer and I look forward to its report.</P>
        <P>Change and transformation has become a way of life in the private and public sector.  The key skill is no longer managing a steady state, it is about managing and sustaining change.  These skills need to be embedded into the service at all levels.  A key principle is that leadership is needed at all levels, not just at the top.  Any change programme must be clearly articulated in simple language and must be explainable in a clear road map with identified programme outcomes, objectives, priorities, timeline and responsibilities.  The plan should be accompanied by a narrative that explains any proposed changes in plain language with the benefits &mdash; that is the value to the citizen &mdash; and the plan to make it happen.  A transformation programme will only be successful if it is led and supported by strong senior leadership.  It must also address all the required enablers to deliver sustainable change &mdash; policy, processes, people and technology.  The change associated with such a programme must address the impacts on key stakeholders within the public service, NGOs and citizens in a structured and planned manner.</P>
        <P>I am ambitious for the public service and I know that the public service is ambitious for itself.  I want the public service to be an exemplar of success by being fit for purpose, performance focused, integrated and citizen centred.  On my election as Taoiseach, I made it clear that I am determined to take decisive action to improve public services.  My ambition is for a renewed and flexible public service which can continue to command the respect and confidence of our citizens and taxpayers.  With the appointment of the task force today, I am taking the first of many steps to deliver on that commitment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a bit like the drainage in the Shannon &mdash; there is nothing new in this and there has been talk about public service reform for a very long time.  This did not begin with the publication of the OECD report on the public service.  It has been a constant revolving issue from the 1960s and the landmark Devlin report followed by many reports, reviews, recommendations and strategies since.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has always been fond of referring to the need to develop better outcomes for our citizens, a concept everybody shares.  In reviewing this matter he would do well to read of the Delivering Better Government report which was produced by the rainbow Government in 1996.  The then Taoiseach, former Deputy John Bruton, said that &ldquo;a more results and performance oriented civil service is essential&rdquo;.  There are some brilliant people in the public service.  There is considerable frustration in the service because of structures that have been established, which block many people and prevent them from giving of their best.  Under the heading, Achieving the Vision, the document made the point that &ldquo;in order to deliver the greater professionalism, the openness and flexibility, the quality and customer orientation and the results and outcome focus required, a significant change must take place&rdquo;, which is self-explanatory.</P>
        <P>I welcome the OECD report and its focus on outcomes, increasing the pace of reform, a more integrated public service, better networking, greater flexibility and mobility.  Many of these concepts are not new and have been around for some time.  Many of them were flagged in that report in 1996.  If one were to characterise or summarise the conclusions of the OECD report, it would be as &ldquo;significant room for improvement&rdquo;.  The main flaws identified by the OECD was the paradox of a small country with a highly fragmented public service, with barriers to the movement of people, skills and experience, which make it difficult to reallocate resources from declining to emerging priorities.  There are dead-end units in many Departments where people cannot transfer and there is not the flexibility one would normally require.</P>
        <P>Without significant reform, the OECD warned that decentralisation would lead to further fragmentation.  Deputy Bruton has carried out an extensive analysis of this issue over the years.  There is a weak management and performance culture, from Ministers down, whereas performance should be key.  When we had the privilege of being appointed as Ministers I remember the then Taoiseach recommending that we should decide on three or four priorities in our Departments and go after them because if we did not do so we would get buried in the trenches of the Department and never be seen again.  It was good advice and I am sure the Taoiseach has given similar advice to his newly appointed Ministers.</P>
        <P>The OECD also criticised the habit of creating new agencies.  Deputy Varadkar pointed out almost 1,000 quangos nationally for every problem.  Some 200 new quangos have been created since 1997, which is one for every D&aacute;il sitting week.  Some of them have gone into production and we have sons of quangos.  The really frustrating thing is that this is not the first time these weaknesses were made self-evident.  The PA Consulting report in 2002 came to the same conclusion.   Since 2004, when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, he has been responsible for solving these problems and ensuring taxpayers&rsquo; money was well spent, but that has not happened.</P>
        <P>In the ten years since the publication of Delivering Better Government the pace of public sector reform, which quickened appreciably during the early to mid-1990s, has slackened off.  At a time of abundant resources, the drive to link reform to additional spending was not maintained.  Too often soft options were taken &mdash; throwing money at a problem, setting up an agency or commission, or asking for another report.</P>
        <P>The public service faces many challenges.  Our economic success and population growth means that many issues are more complex.  Expectations from the public, used to cut-throat competition in certain private sector areas, is higher than ever.  Ireland has growing responsibil<Col N="756"/>ities and obligations from international bodies such as the EU, the WTO etc.  In the past ten years, there has been a significant tendency at Government level to plan for the next election instead of the next generation.  Too often, Government focused on immediate and short-term political needs instead of the requirements for the bigger picture and long-term sustainable development.</P>
        <P>The OECD report contains many worthwhile and forward-looking recommendations.  The dilemma facing the Government, however, is that the opportunity, which the first benchmarking award presented for linking reform to increased remuneration, was missed.  The challenge the Government must now face is convincing public servants that reform is not only in the interest of the citizen but also in their own interest.  Public servants need to be persuaded that an efficient, effective, well run public service will be a better place to work in, will provide a more rewarding career and will give infinitely greater job satisfaction.  Later in the debate, some of my colleagues will touch on specific areas of reform, which we believe are necessary.</P>
        <P>I do not want to let the opportunity pass without returning to the importance of citizen-centred or patient-centred services.  When an organisation is supposed to be citizen-centred and patient-centred and does not turn out to be that way, it causes a deep-rooted anxiety and negative feeling about &ldquo;the public service&rdquo;.  Ministers are in Government to drive through reform of efficiency where reward for performance is evident and, as a consequence, where there is better efficiency in the public service and much better job satisfaction.  The Health Service Executive has in excess of 100,000 employees.  It is difficult to unscramble the egg of the HSE.  From my experience of dealing with relatively small numbers of HSE staff, I am aware that there are concerned individuals with a vision working in the system but the structures within which they operate create the inability to deliver the service.  Public service reform is about giving citizens what they need; response to telephone calls and access to people.  Whatever the service, it is important to have a clear agenda and decisiveness of delivery.  That is what we all aspire to have.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is in charge now.  I hope when the report comes back before the end of the summer it is realistic and practical and that he will implement it in a realistic way so that there is a return for the taxes people pay in terms of an efficient public service.  That is in everybody&rsquo;s interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach&rsquo;s initiative today deserves at best one cheer.  After 11 years in Government, with responsibility for public services for four years, he has set up a task force to examine public service reform.  Not a single initiative has been announced today.  That does not indicate a Taoiseach who has thought about the direction of change we must undertake.</P>
        <P>I remind the Taoiseach that many of the proposals we now see from the OECD run directly contrary to what he has done as Minister for Finance.  Benchmarking provided an opportunity to link public service pay and performance but it was ignored.  Again, under the Taoiseach&rsquo;s stewardship of the Department of Finance, top level pay for senior public servants and Ministers came up for review.  That was another opportunity to link public sector pay with performance but that opportunity was not seized either.  Under the Taoiseach&rsquo;s watch the serious scrutiny that was to emerge from the value for money system established through legislation in 1997 was melted down.  That was to involve a three-year rolling programme through which everything would be scrutinised and lessons were to be applied in the way budgets were set.  Senior civil servants had to admit that even where that was done, it had no impact on the budget.</P><Col N="757"/>
        <P>Likewise, when the Taoiseach had the opportunity to introduce serious reform of the way the budget was debated in the House he did not do so, he did the exact opposite.  He decided to introduce public spending proposals and tax proposals to the House at the one time and without scrutiny, and to have a debate at the end of the process.  That is not the way a modern Government committed to public service reform should spend its money.  The budget system must hunt down waste and reward performance and when money gets tight it must not hurt the weak and the vulnerable.  Even in the past four months, under pressure on public spending, the Government has made the weak and the vulnerable hurt.  The Taoiseach is not hunting down waste in public spending.  At every hand&rsquo;s turn we see cutbacks in respite care, beds are being closed and small schemes are being economised on as money runs out for people who need support.  The process is only starting because there has been no serious effort to find economies in public spending.</P>
        <P>Much of what has occurred has been on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s watch.  For example, decentralisation was pushed ahead on his watch.  We know from the annual conferences of public servants and from the OECD report that that has been a wasteful use of scarce public servant management time, which has not allowed managers to do the job the Taoiseach says is the priority, to deliver at the front line to the customers and the users of public services.  Instead, managers&rsquo; time has been absorbed in what amounts to famine work in many cases, of lining up and trying to decide which agencies will move when we know in our heart of hearts that State agencies are not going to move.  That is the reality.  After four years the Government has delivered 20% of the decentralisation promised.  If that is an omen for how much the Taoiseach will do in terms of public service reform, it is not a good one.</P>
        <P>It is worth reminding the Taoiseach to bear in mind some recommendations.  We need to develop managerial and leadership capacity.  We need a five-year vision for the public service.  We need an imaginative service-wide performance system.  We need to review the structures to reposition e-Government as a core strategic area delivering services to consumers of public services.  We need robust measures of consumer satisfaction and greater input by citizens.  Does the Taoiseach recognise those recommendations?  They are drawn from a report issued to him before he became Minister for Finance in 2002.  That was the tone and direction of the recommendations he had on his desk when he took up office in the Department of Finance as Minister with responsibility for forming budgets and delivering public services.  What happened to the recommendations?  Six years later the same issues are being presented as the new challenges.  A task force has been set up to examine those challenges that the Taoiseach knew about six years ago because they were included in a report he had on his desk when he took office.</P>
        <P>That is not good enough.  I would have some belief in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment in the area if he intended to introduce initiatives as and from this year&rsquo;s Estimates &mdash; for example, that agencies would have to compete for their money and that there would be scrutiny in the Oireachtas before we vote on money; that alternative uses of money would be considered; that we would look for efficiencies in administration in this year&rsquo;s Estimates process to save frontline services; and that quangos and the appointments to State boards would be scrutinised by the Oireachtas so that properly qualified persons would be appointed to those positions.</P>
        <P>I would welcome such proposals on a change of direction, but we do not see any such proposals, which is why I am disheartened and fear that what is behind the proposed public sector reform is not a well thought-out strategy based on four years&rsquo; experience of running the public service.  Neither is it apparent that the Taoiseach intends to move in a new direction but that the fragmentation of agencies, which is evident, will combine with the rigidity of the HR management that he drove from the Department of Finance.  The report stated the Department of Finance was driving rigidity into a highly fragmented system so they have neither devolution <Col N="758"/>nor delegation with the flexibility to act.  It is the worst of all worlds.  If I thought a momentum for change was coming I would give the Taoiseach three cheers.  I do not have great faith in the proposal to set up a task force with worthies on it.  The Taoiseach has 11 years ministerial experience, four of which were in the public service sector.  We should see initiatives that would make a difference to the Estimates being formed as we speak.  As we come to next year&rsquo;s budget we should see a different type of Estimate, namely, Ministers committing in advance to targets they will achieve with the money we give them, that we will have scrutinised that in advance and will be confident the Ministers can deliver and will be accountable for them.  We have got used to not expecting that.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline a few examples of big initiatives that were announced by the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the past.  We were to deliver complete transformation of the way we dealt with climate change.  At least the Minister for Transport had the good grace to announce it was a total failure and that we did not deliver anything.  We only delivered 20% of the decentralisation that was promised.  At best, only 20% of the 2001 health reform strategy was delivered in terms of primary care centres and the issues the Taoiseach said are so important.  I could go on.  The spatial strategy is another example of strategies being announced with great commitment by the new time, but there has not been a system for making people accountable and delivering change at political level.  That corrodes the system as it filters down.  There cannot be performance down the line if people in authority do not take responsibility.  I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s rhetorical commitment in this area but I want to see more before I am convinced it will mean something.</P>

	<P>Talking about public service reform is a little like attempting to peel a grape; one wonders if the pleasure of eating the grape is worth the effort and time taken to peel it.</P>
        <P>Broadly speaking, large elements of our public service function well and the majority of our public servants do very good work.  The OECD recognises that a vibrant, functioning public sector underpins economic growth.  It also recognises the key role our public service played in Ireland&rsquo;s drive for economic prosperity.  The Industrial Development Authority, and latterly the National Treasury Management Agency, are good case studies in that respect.</P>
        <P>It is important that we do not forget the significant achievements of the public service and concentrate on planning for more achievements in the future.</P>
        <P>We see many people jumping on the bandwagon and looking for any stick with which to beat the public sector.  This OECD report is not a stick with which to beat the public sector.  It is something of a fillip in terms of the great work part of the public service does and is in many ways a manifesto, even if the language is somewhat difficult to grasp, for the comprehensive renewal the public service needs to go that extra mile for the new Ireland of today after the years of economic expansion and now facing an uncertain period of containment and even faltering growth.</P>
        <P>We want a modern, responsive and citizen focused public service.  Reform must not be a euphemism for cutbacks or a Trojan horse for a neo-liberal agenda where the only way to deal with the public service is to privatise it, outsource it or get rid of it.  We need a fundamental renewal of our public service that puts the citizen first.  We must renew our public service to make it fit for purpose and fit to serve Ireland in the 21st century.</P>
        <P>Many people are taken with the idea of contracting out all public services but it must be borne in mind that regarding services such as security, education and health it is difficult to envisage the quantum of needs of the citizen being fulfilled purely by private sector profit-<Col N="759"/>driven corporations on their own.  We do not have a model of that available anywhere in the world.  It can happen in rather narrow areas for a period of time but it tends not to happen in a comprehensive way.  For example, if all the babies in a country are to be vaccinated, a properly organised and funded public agency will be required to do it.  That is the case if we are talking about Ireland, the United States, Scandinavia or the developing world.  Public services are and should be an essential feature of any civilised society.</P>
        <P>The truth about the Irish public service is that some elements of it are excellent while others cry out for serious change, renewal and reform.  Any consideration of public services must restate the obvious &mdash; the public service exists to serve the citizens who, having paid their taxes, are entitled as a right to expect reasonable levels of service in key areas such as health, education, security, transport and the environment.</P>
        <P>There is no reason public services and public servants here should not welcome the challenge of renewal this report, and a legion of other reports, puts forward as being central.  The public service must move on.  It must meet the needs of the citizen effectively, efficiently and at a reasonable price.</P>
        <P>The private sector has changed a great deal.  There was a time when banks did not open at lunch time.  It is taken for granted now that not only can one go to one&rsquo;s bank at lunch time but one can avail of banking services on-line.  The public service must parallel and follow what is happening in the world of private commerce and industry and also deal with the fact that public services are now judged against a global benchmark.</P>
        <P>Some of our young people travel to Australia for a year out and experience a quality public transport system.  Older people travel to Lisbon and are amazed at the type of public transport system there.  When they return here they wonder why such systems are available in comparable countries, some of which do not have our income levels, but not here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we want to be a knowledge-based society, with high level jobs and high earners who are attracted to live here, our country must function well in terms of the services it provides.  We do not want some form of gated community where people are gated in their employment and at home because they do not want to be in the ordinary part of that society.  If we want to be at the top in terms of economic performance in the private sector, we also need a vibrant, functioning public service.</P>
        <P>Much of the public service has responded well to the challenge of modern Ireland.  A good example is the Revenue Commissioners, who collect vastly more taxation, upgraded their computer services under a great deal of pressure and, for the past 20 years, engaged in a real and effective form of decentralisation.  They did not simply send functions to isolated locations but decentralised large elements of their services and decision making to areas such as the mid-west region.  They show that the public service can do that.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the country owes a debt to the Trojan work done by teachers and principals in developing areas who have faced not only the challenges of major growths in population and the need to build and manage extra schools but also the huge new immigrant population that must be catered for.  In that respect, I read the last case study at the end of the book about school planning.  It defeated the authors of the report in that they failed to understand the full dimensions of the challenge.  They pulled their punches when it came to the sad lack of performance of the previous Minister for Education and Science and a number of the officials involved in the debacle of school provision.  We have ended up with segregated schools which may be the ghettos of the future unless the public service can recognise that from a policy point of view it is counter to our future economic success, and it must be dealt with.  The report is useful but it is not perfect.</P><Col N="760"/>
        <P Just="Left">Decentralisation was a political stroke.  It had operated on a much smaller scale but very successfully in the previous ten to 15 year period and was partly initiated when Labour and Fianna F&aacute;il were in Government together.  It was a slow and rather expensive process but at that time offering local temporary vacancies in places like Donegal, Sligo and even in Wexford was an enormous economic boost to those areas because the unemployment rate in some areas was well over 20%.  It was a tremendous economic fit as well as being innovative.</P>
        <P>The problem with the McCreevy report, which the Government must revisit and it is not just a decision for the Civil Service, is that it was a political stroke.  Everything was to decentralise all over the place and the consequences of it were that it is incoherent and very destructive, as the OECD report points out, to the collective corporate memory in various Departments.  It has resulted in a 90% turnover in some sections.  Had the Civil Service been involved in the management of a more modest programme of decentralisation from the beginning, it is quite possible that much more progress would have been made by now, at far less cost than the political stroke undertaken by the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy.  Civil servants will be aware that people are being decentralised under what is known as the &ldquo;hot bedding&rdquo; system.  They are going to various locations to work for two or three days.  People are hiring apartments and some use them for the first two or three days of the week and then go back to Dublin or wherever while others take over the flat.  It is incredibly costly and certainly not constructive in terms of people&rsquo;s job satisfaction.  The Labour Party has said that this needs to be re-audited and reconsidered and an agreed framework arrived at which is not destructive of the Departments and services involved.</P>
        <P>I welcome, too, in this report the proposal by the OECD that the charges introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il for applications under the Freedom of Information Act be scrapped.  The sole purpose of those charges was to limit applications for information to which the public and the media should be entitled.  They should be in a position to analyse what has gone on in terms of Government performance.  The suggestion in the report of greater staff mobility and integration between State agencies, local authorities and the public service would be welcomed in principle, I believe, by the majority of public servants, not least some of those interested in decentralisation &mdash; or not, as is the case with more than half of them.  However, it will be extraordinarily challenging to deliver that type of change, particularly now when finances are tighter.  How does someone who has worked in F&Aacute;S, for example, for 20 or 30 years transfer to the general public service system and <i>vice versa</i>?  I do not know whether consideration has been given to that.</P>
        <P>There is also a suggestion about a two-tiered structure of public service &mdash; introducing a type of upper management tier that presumably will have its own pay structure &mdash; which needs to be watched very carefully.  We have seen an extraordinary gulf arising between the pay of the highest and lowest grades in the public service in recent years, including the pension entitlements of the top bosses, which are estimated to be between 10% and 30% of their salary value.</P>
        <P>We have had a unified public service in Ireland since the foundation of the State, one that has largely been free of corruption and unified in purpose.  If we are to introduce a segregated two-tier system of the generals on the top on super-pay pensions and conditions, with the ordinary foot soldiers at the bottom, on or close to minimum wages, that will have massive implications for the public service.  It may be attractive in the short term from a cost-cutting viewpoint, but as with the Garda structure, because this is such a small country there is value in a unified service to which the people working in it owe a duty of loyalty to the citizens and institutions of the State, as opposed to one in which the lower ranks in particular, perceiving themselves to be abused, are dissociated from such a commitment.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="761"/>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate.  Discussion of public service reform cannot be used as a euphemism for cuts in the public sector.  Past experience has made people justifiably concerned that this is what the Government is really getting at when it speaks of public service reform.  A discussion on public service reform is needed, but it must be about how the State can deliver better public services in a more efficient manner and how it is to meet the needs of a growing population at a time when Exchequer revenues are in decline.  We need to focus on how wastage and inefficiency can be eliminated and to discuss the type of public services we want.  Many people are deeply unhappy with the low tax-low public services model that has been implemented in the past decade in particular.  Is this model good for citizens or for the economy or competitiveness?  Will it not end up costing us more in the long term? </P>
        <P>The OECD report points out that while public expenditure has risen by 5% a year, &ldquo;much of these increases have reflected a need to play catch-up from historically low levels&rdquo;.  Public spending in Ireland is the third lowest in the OECD as a percentage of GDP.  Significantly, the OECD report recognises the important role of the public sector in our economic achievements to date.  However, we need to look at the best model of public service delivery internationally and learn from this.  It is widely recognised that the Nordic countries deliver the most advanced public services.  We should see what lessons we can learn from them.  A wide-ranging debate is needed because any decision we take now will have implications long into the future.  Will the task force the Taoiseach has spoken about look at these issues?  A key priority that Sinn F&eacute;in and, I believe, the majority of people in the State want is increased quality and capacity within public services.</P>
        <P>The population of the State has grown considerably in recent years from just over 3.6 million in 1996 to in excess of 4.2 million by 2006.  In some areas, such as the greater Dublin area and the commuter belt, the population growth has been dramatic.  Quite simply, public services have not been adequately expanded to meet this increased demand and the pressure is being felt in schools and hospitals in particular.  As a result, we continue to have patients on trolleys in our hospitals and pupils taught in overcrowded pre-fabs.  Public transport is full to capacity, particularly in urban centres, while rural areas lack proper public transport infrastructure.  Social housing output has not been sufficient to meet demands and there are still approximately 43,600 families on housing waiting lists.</P>
        <P>Public services such as health and education are not meeting people&rsquo;s needs or expectations.  Obviously, achieving increased quality and capacity in public services has to involve getting better value for money in public spending.  However, value for money cannot be equated simply with spending less.  Well managed short to medium-term social investment will often yield medium to long-term savings to the Exchequer as other direct and indirect costs are reduced.  We need to ensure that public money is used effectively to deliver improvements in public services, to deliver better and more efficient public services to meet the needs of all our citizens.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The OECD talks about the need for the public to be at the centre of the service.  I do not believe that this is the case at present. Services and how they are delivered are not people centred and for many people this is less than satisfactory.  For example, the recruitment ban in the HSE is the type of arbitrary action that takes little account of the impact on the public, which is trying to access the service.  It is the kind of action that has long-term implications.  The OECD states: &ldquo;The development of longer term, more strategic budgetary mechanisms covering spending programmes, could contribute to greater certainty for senior management and more efficiency in programme deliver.&rdquo;  I believe this is particularly true in respect of the health service.  It is the absence of this type of approach that leads to decisions such as the recruitment ban in the HSE and the annual phenomenon of <Col N="762"/>hospitals cancelling procedures and appointments in the last months of the year in order to meet budgetary constraints.</P>
      
        <P>While Sinn F&eacute;in by no means agrees with all its recommendations, the OECD in its report on integrated public services has made interesting observations, some of which will not please the Government.  It raises serious questions about the implications of the so-called decentralisation process, referred to more accurately by the OECD as administrative relocation.  It makes clear that it has the potential to undermine the ability of the State to deliver integrated public services because it makes cross-departmental work more difficult.  The reality is that the decentralisation process originated in short-term populist thinking.  After all, decentralisation was introduced at the whim of a former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, without any debate or discussion with the stakeholders, such as trade union representatives, and without consideration of the implications for the future of governance and the public service.</P>
        <P>This report highlights the need for the Government to consider again the decentralisation process.  For example, we must ask whether we have ever had an accurate assessment of the cost of the process to enable us to determine whether it delivers value for money.  With regard to many State agencies, decentralisation simply has not worked and will not work, and should be abandoned before any more money is wasted thereon.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in strongly agrees with the suggestion that devolution of greater powers to local government is required.  Many services would be delivered better and more efficiently by local government, as is the practice in many other European states, which have well developed local government systems.</P>
        <P>The report touches on the need to empower those who work in management positions within the public service to make decisions and take the initiative.  That is important.  There is a lot of media hysteria that creates a very negative impression of public sector workers, characterising them as lazy and over-paid.  That suggestion is very unfair.  Anyone who has interaction with those delivering health care and education can testify how untrue such assertions are.  Employees in the public sector, as taxpayers like the rest of us, want to be part of a process that delivers a better and more efficient public service.  Improving management practices must be part of this process.</P>
        <P>When I began dealing with public servants, particularly after my election to Louth County Council in 1999, the efficiency and competence of some of the senior management staff of the local authority came as an unbelievably pleasant surprise.  Like many other members of the public, I had perceived negativity in respect of many public sector workers but one of my first impressions on becoming elected was their competence and ability.</P>
        <P>The report is rightly critical of the explosion in Government agencies, the number of which it estimates at 800.  As a consequence, it notes &ldquo;the Public Service remains segmented overall, leading to sub-optimal coherence in policy development, implementation and service delivery&rdquo;.  The setting up of so many new agencies concerns many Members of the D&aacute;il.  These agencies are, in many cases, not accountable.  We cannot obtain answers from the line Minister on the basis that this or that matter falls under the remit of a particular agency.  This includes one of the most important agencies, the HSE.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate opportunities exist for Oireachtas Members to meet HSE staff, as happened yesterday in my constituency where the four Oireachtas Members attended such a meeting, this is insufficient.  While the staff are pleasant people and answer questions occasionally, their doing so is not the same as their being held to account in this House.  That is a perfect example of a lack of accountability.</P><Col N="763"/>
        <P>The sooner the HSE is disbanded or replaced, the better.  Bad as the former health boards were, they allowed for some political accountability.  At least members of local authorities or Members of the Oireachtas had a direct input into them.  Unfortunately, that is no longer the case.  While one could argue there is a regional forum in place, it does not have anything like the level of accountability that existed when the health boards were in operation.  I do not say this with a hankering to return to the health board system &mdash; many who had to reflect on and deal with them had a bad experience &mdash; but the HSE serves as a good example of how State agencies can get out of hand entirely.</P>
        <P>I look forward to further discussion on this matter in the near future and hope the Government will listen to some of the contributions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of effective, customer-focused, value for money public services is a central aim of the Government.  The OECD report we are discussing provides us with a platform for the modernisation of the manner in which we deliver public services to citizens.</P>
        <P>By any analysis, our public service has made enormous progress in the past decade.  The efficiency and customer service focus of the Revenue Commissioners is one example and the increased integration of special needs education into mainstream education is another.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in the internal organisation of Departments and public bodies.  Basic changes have been made in the way in which public service pay is determined and staff have accepted real changes in terms and working conditions.  The recent introduction of annual output statements, initially in Departments, by my predecessor means that attention can now be focused on the level of delivery provided for citizens by each organisation.  The OECD acknowledges the very important contribution the public service has made to our economic success.</P>
        <P>In spite of the foregoing, there is now a clear need to intensify the modernisation process.  Consequently the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, commissioned this report just over a year ago.  Shortly after my appointment to Government last June, I put on record my dissatisfaction with the proliferation of Government bodies and agencies.  We have gone too far right across government in handing over specific functions to agencies.  In doing so, we are abdicating our responsibilities as the elected Government of the people.  I, therefore, welcome the OECD&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the need to improve governance and I regard its recommendations in this area as among the most important in the entire report.</P>
        <P>When the Government asked the OECD to carry out this work, it was provided with clear terms of reference.  It was asked, first, to benchmark the public service in Ireland against other comparable countries and, second, to make recommendations as to the future directions for public service reform that will support the Government&rsquo;s drive for the delivery of world-class services to the citizen.</P>
        <P>The review team conducted a series of over 100 interviews with Ministers and Oireachtas members, Government officials, social partners and other stakeholders from relevant bodies, the private sector and academia.  In addition, following an advertising campaign in the media, a total of 834 submissions were received from private individuals and a further 102 submissions were received from various organisations.</P>
        <P>The main recommendations of the report cover a wide range of issues relating to the formulation of policy and the delivery of services.  The first of these relates to the need to focus on delivering the best services to citizens.  This prioritisation on the part of the OECD must be correct.  The citizen must be at the core of public services as it is the citizen who funds them.  This must be borne in mind by all public servants in their dealings with citizens.  Given the <Col N="764"/>unprecedented resources invested by the Government in the past 11 years, it is only right that the public should demand improved levels of service delivery in its dealings with the public sector.</P>
        <P>I welcome the OECD report&rsquo;s call for a more integrated public service.  There is clearly a need for better interaction between stakeholders at local, national and international levels, and across these levels.  The average citizen expects that Government services will operate in an integrated way and does not expect that he or she will have to commute between a range of public service bodies to avail of services that may be integrated.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that moving towards such an integrated public service needs to be achieved in a carefully structured way so we will retain the benefits of initiatives already commenced.  Staff should not feel threatened by this approach as the Government has a track record of advancing initiatives through a process of consultation with staff interests, and it will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>In the past decade or so, Ireland has experienced unparalleled levels of economic success and prosperity.  However, the economic environment has clearly become more challenging in recent months and the outlook is less benign and more uncertain.  The risks that were identified in the last budget have materialised &mdash; recent developments in the international financial markets have led to a squeeze on liquidity; further appreciation of the euro against the dollar and sterling has made us the possessor of a strong currency, thereby weakening our international competitiveness; lower international growth; and, domestically, a sharper slowdown in housing construction.  Therefore, we must all accept that the short-term prospects are more challenging and we must ensure that we respond appropriately.  One way in which we can respond is to ensure that our public services are as efficient and effective as possible.</P>
        <P>I agree fully with the report&rsquo;s suggestion that there must be a move towards a performance focus with more information being gathered and made available on the outputs and outcomes that have been achieved.  My predecessor already has set in train the first steps in this process with the introduction of annual output statements for Departments.  The OECD has acknowledged the success of these statements and has recommended that they be extended to agencies.</P>
        <P>One timely proposal from the OECD relates to the need for greater prioritisation within budgetary frameworks.  This means that, as a community, we will not be able to pursue all of our goals at the same time.  The Government must focus on the priority areas of protecting the weaker in society by maintaining a high level of social spending, delivering better and more effective public services, seeking value for money at all levels of public spending and continuing to invest heavily in public infrastructure to support Ireland&rsquo;s long-term prospects.</P>
        <P>The OECD rightly believes that e-Government must be used more widely to achieve a more citizen-centred approach.  As Members are aware, the Taoiseach announced recently that responsibility for e-Government would be consolidated in my Department.  This is in keeping with recommendations from both the OECD and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report on e-Government.</P>
        <P>One of the key tasks for the Department will be to establish the scope of the next e-Government programme.  To this end, my Department will engage with Departments, offices and other public bodies to identify opportunities and to develop achievable e-Government targets.  Such targets will be set in the context of the wider modernisation programme underlying the need to improve the quality of customer service and Ireland&rsquo;s standing in international benchmarking and perception, the need to drive administrative and process simplification and the need to improve value for money in a tightening fiscal environment.  My Department also will establish a mechanism for reporting on such targets to the Government and for keeping it apprised of <Col N="765"/>progress on a regular basis.  It will focus on developing responses to the various benchmarks in this area, with particular emphasis on achieving better ratings in the European Union benchmarks.  In this context, my Department also will agree with public bodies those services that should not be delivered on-line, as well as a rationale for their exclusion.</P>
        <P>One significant e-Government initiative is Reach, the public services broker project.  Following a review of Reach, its functions were transferred to my Department from the Department of Social and Family Affairs in April of this year.  In line with the recommendations in that review, my Department is integrating the functions of the Reach portal onto existing Government websites, using off-the-shelf software for some of the more costly elements of the broker, and evaluating possible new approaches to addressing the problem of reliably establishing on-line identities.  My Department also will work on developing template e-Government systems to help small and medium public bodies develop quickly an on-line presence on the Internet.</P>
        <P>Now that the OECD team has completed its significant task, the process must be taken forward.  The Government must assess each recommendation to ascertain which are optimal and can be taken forward immediately and which must be considered in more detail.  With this in mind, the Taoiseach recently announced the formation of a task force to examine, among other matters, the OECD report.  The terms of reference for the task force will require it to prepare for consideration by the Government a comprehensive framework for renewal of the public service, which will take into account the analysis and conclusions of the OECD report, as well as the lessons to be drawn from the strategic management initiative, the organisational review programme and the recent efficiency reviews.</P>
        <P>The task force will be made up of those who have wide experience in both the public and private sector.  The requirement for the task force to complete its work and report back to the Government by the end of the summer underlines the determination of the Government to maintain momentum in this process.  The task force will consult with the public service unions as part of its work programme.</P>
        <P>As I noted at the outset, the reform of the manner in which services are delivered to the citizen and the quality of those services is a central priority for the Government.  The report provides the Government with a springboard for the reform process.  It will stimulate a useful debate on the continued modernisation of the Irish public service and I wish the task force well in considering how many of the interesting recommendations included in the report can best be applied to Irish circumstances.  I look forward to hearing Members&rsquo; views on the report&rsquo;s findings and its suggestions on how the task force should proceed.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Finance&rsquo;s speech is more of the same.  The Government commissions expensive reports, such as this OECD public management review and while it is a good report, it merely states the obvious.  Although the Minister has left the House, I note the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh.  I wish to make some references to the contents of the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  He referred to what the Government has done in respect of increased integration of special needs education into mainstream education.  What of the children with autism?  The new OECD report refers to being citizen-centred.  What about being child-centred?  What of a child who has a special need to access in respect of applied behavioural analysis, ABA?  No reference was made to it in the Minister&rsquo;s speech.</P><Col N="766"/>
        <P>I note the Minister for Finance had a get-out clause in respect of agencies.  He stated he had put on record his dissatisfaction with the increase in Government bodies and agencies.  I am sure this is the case because 200 such bodies have been established under the Government&rsquo;s watch since 1997.  A total of 1,000 such bodies exist, many of which are duplicating work.</P>
        <P>As for the economic outlook, the Minister took no responsibility for the fact that when proper public service reform was required, the Government did absolutely nothing.  While there have been countless reports, they never have been acted upon.  Although the OECD report is good, will the Government act on it?  Moreover, the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, set up the task force for public sector reform.  While I welcome the putting in place of its committee members, will its recommendations be acted upon?  Will it come up with anything that is not already known?  I refer to the squandering of money and the simple measures that should have been put in place.  For instance, public sector bodies and agencies should have been told to set targets of cuts in administration costs of 2% or 3% per year, thereby perhaps enabling the savings to go to frontline services.</P>
        <P>As for output statements, as a new Deputy and an accountant, they provide little value.  In the main they are narrative in form and must be reconsidered.  They should be framed in language that will enable Members to engage in proper scrutiny.  I refer to looking after those who are less well off.  Since 2002, Government-regulated services have contributed 45% of the rate of inflation.  Furthermore, the poor and vulnerable are affected by high rates of inflation in many respects and the Government has done little in this regard.</P>
        <P>No proper planning took place in respect of e-Government and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the subject was damning.  I note the Minister for Finance referred to the public service broker project.  However, he completely neglected to mention that &euro;35 million has been wasted on that project to date.  Although he was discussing the Government&rsquo;s actions, he failed to mention the ill-functioning nature of the project.  Furthermore, the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on e-Government stated that no plan was in place for 2007.  While a plan existed for 2005 and 2006, proper planning was absent.  In this regard, I was present at the final appearance of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, before the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  He admitted, on reflection, that the single area on which the Government was accountable pertained to the proper planning of e-projects and various projects.  The Government obliged officials to perform their day jobs as well as trying to manage sophisticated projects.  Specific teams, perhaps from several Departments, should have been looking after this area and the Government stands indicted in this regard.</P>
        <P>I revert to the OECD report itself.  It speaks about two main issues, namely, an integrated public service and citizen-focused services from the public service.  In layman&rsquo;s terms, &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; means there is duplication of effort between Departments and agencies.  Furthermore, an element of turf warfare probably is taking place between various agencies and this will come down to the individuals concerned.  The phrase, &ldquo;citizen-focused services&rdquo;, simply means that those who ring a Department will not be left waiting for 20 minutes to get through and will not be pushed from one person to another.</P>
        <P>While many public servants do a terrific job, the consistency of service I seek is absent.  That is a key point because one may phone the public service and receive an excellent service from one individual but speak to a different person when one calls again.  This relates to management and putting systems in place.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to Ireland&rsquo;s considerable demographic changes in recent years.  Nearly 15% of Ireland&rsquo;s population is foreign-born.  These people are very welcome, but that brings <Col N="767"/>its own challenges.  With our ageing population, the dependency ratio is increasing rapidly, which also presents challenges.</P>
        <P>The report makes specific reference to proper planning for schools, which is important.  That has not happened to date.  In many urban settings houses are built and there are many young children, but no space is left to build schools.  Some local authorities are good in this regard and others are not, but consistency is needed.</P>
        <P>Regarding Government agencies, the report uses the word &ldquo;agencification&rdquo;, which relates to the proliferation of agencies.  The report states that the Government uses agencies to increase the number of people working in the public sector via a back door system.  The report is critical of this practice because it has lead to a lack of accountability and increased fragmentation.</P>
        <P>My final point relates to decentralisation and it will be of interest to the new Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Martin Mansergh.  Decentralisation, which is now called administrative relocation, was not properly planned and if it is not properly implemented now it may lead to further fragmentation.  I welcome the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General has seen fit to conduct a report on this matter.  The Government stands indicted.  The Minister for Finance of the time, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, announced decentralisation to some fanfare on 3 December 2003.  He said over 10,000 jobs would be decentralised by the end of 2006 and that if this was not achieved heads should roll.  I have not seen heads roll yet.  Will that happen?  Only 2,700 jobs have been decentralised so far and only 120 people were decentralised in 2008.  Only 50% of these people came from Dublin.  What will the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, do on this issue?  Will there be decentralisation and what changes will be introduced?</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell for allowing me to contribute to this debate at the last minute.  I make no apologies for saying my emphasis will be on the health services in the north east.</P>
        <P>In the D&aacute;il last Thursday, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, said the OECD report supported the line she had taken under the Teamwork report.  She also said she was going on advice she received from Northern Ireland.  I did not find that support for the Minister in the OECD report.  The organisation was careful not to be too prescriptive but suggested there should be two centres of excellence in the north east.  I read on Thursday in the <i>agendaNI</i> magazine that two new hospitals will be built in the coming years in Northern Ireland, at a cost of &pound;450 million.  One hospital will be in Enniskillen and the other in Omagh, despite the fact that there are excellent, high quality services in Derry and Craigavon.  I urge that, even at this late stage, the Minister talk to health service personnel in Northern Ireland and, more importantly, to the people trying to run the system in the north east, in spite of misdirection by Teamwork and the executives.</P>
        <P>The recent occurrences in Drogheda do not give much confidence to the people I represent.  I agree fully with the suggestion in the report that there must be a more performance-centred approach.</P>
        <P>I wish to put on the record of the House my disappointment that a solemn commitment given by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to the national and international media to fund a dual carriageway from Derry to Dublin has already been broken by the Government, through the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, at a committee set up to oversee the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  We need proper planning, commitment and, above all, honesty.</P>

	<P>I congratulate Deputy Martin Mansergh on his elevation to the post of Minister of State at the Department of Finance and Deputy John Curran on his promotion to Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, with responsibility for drug strategy.  I also congratulate Deputy Brian Lenihan, who has left the House; he has moved to the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>I welcome the debate on this very important report produced by the OECD.  To begin my contribution I will quote from the first few lines of the executive summary which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland&rsquo;s economic success story is one that many OECD countries would like to emulate.  While the reasons underpinning Ireland&rsquo;s success are varied, the Irish public service has played a central role in ensuring that the right economic, regulatory, educational and social conditions are in place to facilitate growth and development.  As with other OECD countries, Ireland has continually sought to modernise and reform its public service systems and practices to ensure that it can continue to meet the needs and expectations of Government and citizens.  Over the past decade, thanks in no small part to its economic performance, the country has also seen significant changes in its demographic make-up.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The most important thing is that, while the report mentions our great success, it refers to change.  These changes must be reflected in our public service.  I will return to this point later in my contribution.</P>
        <P>I was a little surprised to read in the report that the percentage of Government employees in the public sector is relatively low compared to other OECD countries.  Ireland has significantly fewer public servants than countries such as Norway, Sweden, France, Finland and Belgium.  It is shown in the report that in this area Ireland has the third lowest level of expenditure as a percentage of GDP.  We should not focus on this too much because part of the reason for the existence of this statistic at the time the report was compiled was Ireland&rsquo;s tremendous economic growth of recent years.  This figure is probably changing as we speak.</P>
        <P>The report refers to the use of agencies and the considerable number of them in Ireland.  My biggest problem with agencies, which is probably shared by many people in this House, is their lack of accountability.  We have all tabled parliamentary questions and been referred to this, that or the other agency for a reply.  I realise the Ceann Comhairle is trying to address this and I hope meaningful change can be effected in this regard.  We must realise that simply doing away with some agencies does not mean there will be better output &mdash; some agencies already produce good output.  We must be selective in our criticism.  Many of the changes made in the public service and these agencies in the past decade have been internally focused.  This is something we must address and I will refer to this later.</P>
        <P>The report undertook five different case studies in health, education, local government, justice and the Civil Service, and I would like to refer to a couple of these.  I agree with the previous speaker, Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell, who referred to the whole area of school planning.  There are huge difficulties in expanding urban areas, especially the greater Dublin area.  The report questions the capacity of the Department of Education and Science to respond to needs in this area.  There must be more co-operation with other agencies to ensure the situations that arose this year and last year do not recur.</P>
        <P>I can give an example of what happened a number of years ago in my area when Waterford City Council sought to develop a whole new neighbourhood with approximately 10,000 new houses.  This area is fairly well developed now.  The council set aside a site for a school and informed the Department of Education and Science of this.</P><Col N="769"/>
    <HtmlBk SectId="5" />
        <P FLI="0">However, it was told it was none of its business.  That type of interaction, or lack of interaction, is not helpful.  I raised this with the Department recently and, in fairness, its attitude has changed and it has started to engage in this case.  However, it needs to do a lot more of this.  The local authority is also the planning authority and it knows where the developments are going and where there will be needs in the future.  There must be more co-operation between these authorities.</P>
        <P>One of the other case studies in the report was that of Garda civilianisation.  I was not surprised to read in the report that the percentage of civilian workers in the Garda organisation is low.  The OECD believes there is resistance to change within the Garda ranks.  In my experience that is the case.  A civilian who was working at a Garda station here in Dublin told me that the garda&iacute; there do not want to give up their desk jobs and go out on the beat.  These are people who have been trained to do that job.  In many instances, the civilian staff do not have enough work to do because of the number of garda&iacute; working inside.  This issue is highlighted in the report and it is something that will have to change.</P>
        <P>A citizen-focused approach is needed from the public service.  Some people in the public service are very good at engaging with the end customer, while others are not.  This must change.  We must have some way of dealing with those who are not able to do so.  I do not know what mechanism we could use.  If it was in the private sector they could be dealt with, but some mechanism must be found to deal with them in the public sector also.  The end customer is Government, business or a citizen.  E-Government is not being fully exploited to assist the public service in dealing with the general public.  There has been more than one instance of this.</P>
        <P>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I have seen various Secretaries General report to the committee on a range of different issues.  In many cases they attribute the reasons certain projects are not being carried out to the computer systems.  The system is not up to speed, or its implementation has been delayed; it is not compatible with other systems that are being used within the Department or, more usually, it is not able to receive information from other agencies, be they outside agencies or other Departments, and the information must be input manually.  This should not be happening.  Technology appears to be a big problem within the public sector.  There have been some spectacular successes, such as the Revenue on-line service, which system has been patented and sold to the authorities in France.  The motor tax on-line service has also been a success.  However, unfortunately there have not been enough of these.</P>
        <P>We need to embed the use of information communication technology, ICT, throughout the public service.  Too often e-Government initiatives and the use of ICT are seen as a technical issue rather than a way in which service delivery can be streamlined or improved.  Rather than incorporating an ICT approach to problem solving or service delivery at an early stage, we try to retrofit new e-Government technologies on old ways of thinking and old systems and processes.  Retrofitting does not work.  Instead, we need to make better use of business process reviews and to rethink approaches to service delivery from the point of view of the citizen or end user.</P>
        <P>There is one theme running throughout the OECD report.  What hits me all the way through is the need for more teamwork, more interlinking between the Departments, which is simply not happening enough at present.  It is happening now in that there are cross-cutting responsibilities at Minister of State level.  This is something on which the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, embarked and which is being developed further by the present Taoiseach.</P>

	<P>If a person writes to another person, whether it be in the HSE, the county council or the social welfare system, it is common manners to answer.  Why will those who work in these organisations not answer the letters and write back a simple reply?  That is what annoys and frustrates people.  They cannot get a reply from the public service.</P>
        <P>In recent times the most common employees in this country have been Mr. and Mrs. Voicemail.  They are employed by the HSE, the OPW and the social welfare system.  Did the Ministers of State ever hear of them?  The trouble with Mr. and Mrs. Voicemail is that they do not call back.  I do not know where they went for interview or how they got their jobs, but they do not answer the public.</P>
        <P>All I can say is that this report is a very good one if its recommendations are to be followed.  Something needs to be done with the public service in this country.  When the public service works it is very good but when it does not work it is a disaster.  Not all county council officials are bad &mdash; some of them are top-class officials who respond to queries and do their jobs.  It is the people within the service who do not do their jobs who need to be targeted.  Somebody <Col N="771"/>needs to take on this responsibility.  People are frustrated with the public service.  There is sometimes a wait of three, four, five or six months to get a reply on a social welfare issue.  These are people who have paid their dues to the State and all they want is to get their pensions on time, but they get letters back saying their queries cannot be dealt with for five or six months.</P>
        <P>Another issue is reminiscent of what happened with the e-voting machines.  There has never been as much money spent on social welfare as there was under this and the last two Governments.  They spent it on social welfare and the health boards.  Yet when we write to any of these organisations we get an answer saying it cannot deal with our query as the IT unit is down.  This is despite our having spent millions &mdash; billions, in some cases &mdash; on these systems.  What is wrong?  Why can we not put people on the front line in the HSE, the social welfare system or the local authorities who can answer people&rsquo;s queries?  These are the taxpayers.  Those in the public service who think they do not have to answer questions must remember that if people were not out there paying their taxes they would not have jobs.  That is why they have jobs, because the taxpayers put them in those jobs.  They expect simple answers.</P>
        <P>People come into my clinic having been frustrated for months by the lack of a reply from the council, the HSE or the social welfare authorities, yet in some cases all I have to do is to make a phone call to sort out the matter.</P>

There should be no mix-ups, letters sent to the wrong people or lost files.  People are frustrated by the public service.  If the report, on which a great deal of money has been spent, is to mean anything, its recommendations must be carried out.</P>

	<P>It is difficult to follow Deputy Ring.  I agree with most of his comments and, while I would put them differently, he has put them well.  Like him when he discussed the democratic deficit in the health service, I wish to refer to the section of the report <Col N="772"/>that addresses the reconfiguration of hospital services.  I also wish the two Ministers of State across the floor well, but I hope their time on the opposite benches will be short.  It is my job to get rid of them.</P>
        <P>There is a serious democratic deficit in the health service and people are losing trust in the HSE.  It has lost that trust and credibility because there is no public accountability, fora or public representative involvement.  In analysing the problems in the health services, while I accept the old health board system had its critics, people could go to a board meeting at least once per month and ask officials to account for themselves and their reports.  Were there a meeting tomorrow, one could ask the officials to account for the appalling scandal regarding X-rays in Drogheda and Navan in which 4,700 people must wait for up to eight weeks for the issue of whether they have serious health problems to be resolved.</P>
        <P>The report puts the case well when, on page 273, it states, &ldquo;The reconfiguration reform project is not a resource issue&rdquo;.  It also states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A key challenge within the reform programme is communicating this prerogative to a population that has high expectations of service delivery, but feels that the government is just trying to save money by closing hospitals; they do not trust the government to provide the relevant services at primary care level in the short-to-medium term.  Faith in the government and in the Health Service Executive to provide an appropriate level of service and to deliver on reforms has been exacerbated by a number of health care scandals.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Due to a lack of communication, no one believes the HSE or the Government when it comes to the reconfiguration of the health service.  Trust in particular has broken down.</P>
        <P>A heading in the report&rsquo;s recommendations on page 290 reads: &ldquo;Take account of demographic needs using international trends&rdquo;.  A key controversy in the north east has been the attempt to reconfigure five hospitals into two.  According to recent HSE research, these hospitals will become one eventually.  The report on which the decision is based is informed by a United Kingdom model and took account of the opinions of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, which claims that a catchment area for a general hospital should be between 450,000 and 500,000 people.  However, it is worth noting that, within other OECD countries, there is a range of possibilities.  For example, the catchment size for a general hospital of 500 beds in France and Germany is three times less, namely, one hospital for every 150,000 inhabitants.  It is important to ensure the model used in the north-east region is the most appropriate.  The HSE and the Government must carry out a broader consideration of international systems, including those that are similar in terms of needs.  The Government could examine different patterns of hospital requirements.</P>
        <P>These recommendations are at odds with HSE policy.  According to the OECD, the outcome of an international review that includes the European experience could be the same, but it could be different.  The north east needs two hospitals, which would meet the region&rsquo;s needs.  The British model of reconfiguring five hospitals into one will not work and is not what the people want.  I do not know why we should slavishly follow the Royal College of Surgeons of England and ignore the obvious experience in France and Germany.  Will the Ministers of State bring this part of the report to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children and make it clear that five into two is the way to go in the north east?  People want at least two hospitals, as the infrastructure will not allow for just one.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This subject is near and dear to the heart of every Deputy, including the Ceann Comhairle, who I do not doubt could wax lyrical in this respect for a long <Col N="773"/>time.  Deputy Ring provided inspiration when he mentioned the e-mail and voicemail systems, but pride of place goes to such a system in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which I had occasion to contact last year.  It read to the effect that the person was sorry, that he or she was out of the office on that day, 23 April 2007, and that he or she would be back in one week.  The only problem was that I contacted the person on 27 July.  One can come to the conclusion that the person had not touched his or her e-mail between 23 April and 27 July.  I do not know what degree of activity was occurring, but it could not have been great.</P>
        <P>There is a tendency to treat the delivery of public services as if it were a business whereby the public must tolerate the quality and level of service provided.  However, that is not how it should be.  The public is entitled to demand and receive a service.  Previous speakers have made other points.  For an unknown reason, we have lost our way.  It may be due to a lack of vocation; the vocational commitment of 25 or 30 years ago may no longer exist.  Something is wrong because the delivery of public service follows different lines.  An expert rather than the public decides what is good for the latter, such as the location of hospitals.  The expert has regard to the convenience of the system for himself or herself, not for the public.  An expert consulted another expert who consulted a third expert who leaked information to the media, the situation turned into a revolving circus and subsequently became policy.  This has occurred for a long time, but it has become embedded in the system to such an extent that it is almost impossible to remove.</P>
        <P>For example, all local authorities undertook a review of their housing lists at the direction of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Approximately 60,000 applicants are on those lists.  At the end of a five-year period after the 2002 general election, the Government decided to recount the applicants to determine whether any had gone away or given up.  The local authorities sent applicants a series of letters and, in some cases, the deadline for responses had expired three, four or five weeks before the letters had even been issued.  There was nothing unusual in this, but the local authorities subsequently wrote to the applicants to tell them that they had been struck off the lists because they had not responded.  This is the type of daftness that brings the public service and politicians into disrepute.  The public has nothing but total contempt for this type of nonsense.  The Ceann Comhairle would be well able to deal with such a situation in his constituency.  Can he imagine the degree of frustration felt by members of the public who ring him to tell him they have been knocked off the housing list because they had not received the letters the local authority claimed it had sent?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Something must be done about it.  I wish both Ministers of State, Deputies McGuinness and Mansergh, well in their respective roles.  I have no doubt they will discharge their duties to the best of their abilities.  One of the duties they should focus on relates to the issue I have raised, which brings everybody and everything into disrepute.</P>
        <P>Another issue that causes problems for people relates to the closing dates for different schemes, which are imposed by officials within the system.  I have no difficulty with the imposition of closing dates for administrative purposes.  However, I object when people whose applications arrive after the closing date are told that they cannot be considered this year and that they must go on the waiting list for the following year.  There is no legislative provision for such penalties.  Rather, these are internal provisions imposed for the convenience of officials.  How dare they deprive an applicant of a higher education grant, for example, simply because some arbitrary closing date has passed?  It is the job of these public servants to deliver the <Col N="774"/>service in question to those who require it within the year to which the application refers.  I could speak about this forever because the degree of public frustration in this regard is such that public representatives are all getting the blame.</P>
        <P>There has been much debate on the establishment of proposed centres of excellence for the provision of cancer care services.  When did it become the case that only certain hospitals could strive to attain that status?  It was my understanding that all hospitals were obliged to be centres of excellence, with the same standards in all, rather than there being some with a higher standard than others.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd observed that the model being implemented in this country was scrapped long ago in the United Kingdom when it was found that it did not work.  There were so many bottlenecks in the delivery of services that the model was entirely changed.</P>
        <P>Somebody needs to take by the scruff the members of the think tanks who produce these ridiculous notions and tell them that before they offer any consultancy advice in future, they must set out where they got their information, who they consulted and took advice from and how much they are being paid to provide that advice.  I have been putting down parliamentary questions on this issue since I first became a Member of the House and I am still awaiting answers to those questions.  It would be of great benefit if something was done in this regard as a result of this report.  Perhaps it is a job for one of the new and energetic Ministers of State.  Civil servants and Ministers may not like it but it is important to get answers to these simple questions.  All we seek are simple answers without long preambles and convoluted explanations.</P>
        <P>I hope I have made some of the points that the Ceann Comhairle might have made.  I have no doubt he is thinking along the same lines as me.</P>

	<P>They are not too long.  I welcome the publication of the OECD review as a starting point for the next phase in the reform of the public service.  I am proud of our public service, with which I have had a close working relationship, initially as a member and for some years subsequent to that as an adviser.  Whether one looks to the peace process, our place at the heart of the EU or social partnership and the success of the economy, it is clear the public has been well served by its public servants, particularly in the past 21 years.  I know from direct experience the improvements that have taken place in the efficiency of agricultural grants and the streamlining of the tax system, particularly through the Revenue on-line service.  I look forward to creative interaction with the civil servants in my Department in my role as Minister of State.  My wife and I took the opportunity some nights ago to watch several episodes of &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo;.  I particularly enjoyed the one in which the Minister proposes to demolish an art gallery to fund a favourite sports organisation in his constituency but is frustrated in so doing.</P>
        <P>It is clear from today&rsquo;s discussion that further advancement of the public service modernisation programme must be focused on the needs of citizens.  We must keep the public at the centre of public services.  The person on the street is not deeply interested in issues of public service organisation; he or she simply wants to see the prompt and efficient delivery of services.  At its heart, modernisation is about delivering excellent public services.  We have come a long way in delivering on this agenda since the launch of the strategic management initiative in 1994 <Col N="775"/>and the Delivering Better Government programme in 1996.  These initiatives set the agenda for modernisation and change to ensure that, on an ongoing basis, the public service would make a greater contribution to national development, be a provider of top class services to the public and make effective use of resources.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the modernisation agenda is driven by various partnership agreements across the public service.  The current agreement, Towards 2016, builds on the progress made under its predecessors and ensures continued co-operation with change and modernisation initiatives as well as improvements in productivity throughout the public service.  It is fair to say that the implementation of the strategic management initiative and delivering better Government programme, as well as the ongoing partnership approach, have contributed greatly to expanding, improving and reforming our public services.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There have been significant improvements in the areas of financial management, human resource management, regulatory reform, e-Government initiatives and custom service delivery mechanisms.  Significant service improvements have also been made and many people&rsquo;s direct experience with the public service is good, with some obvious exceptions in pressurised areas.  However, while significant progress has been made in the last decade or so, we must accept that many more changes are both awaited and needed.  Our society and economy continue to change, rapidly in some cases, and public services must keep pace with, and preferably anticipate, that change.</P>
        <P>Several Deputies referred to decentralisation.  I took the opportunity yesterday to visit the temporary decentralised offices in Tipperary town, which were opened earlier this month.  Many of the staff members are from Limerick and are pleased to be able to work closer to home.</P>

	<P>We will see.  There is a misconception that decentralisation is all about civil servants being shipped out of Dublin.  In many cases, they are people who, for the first time, are able to work in the area in which they live.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the support of the Labour Party for this motion.  The motion is self-explanatory but the rationale behind it requires further elucidation.  At the core of it is the question of trust.  What is at issue is whether the people of the north west and west can trust the Government, the Minister for Health and Children and the monolithic Health Service Executive to deliver the services they have promised.</P>
        <P>Let us look at the record.  In January 2007, the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, gave a commitment in an interview on Newstalk that there would be no cutbacks in health.  That proved not to be the case.  The Minister then said that the cutbacks would not hurt patients, but they did.  We saw the closure of wards, the cancellation of operating lists, increasing numbers of patients lying on trolleys, a 10% increase in waiting times for procedures, the withdrawal of home help packages for children and people with disabilities, the removal of home help for the elderly alongside the more recent suspension of hospital in the home scheme and the failure to implement the vision for change in mental health, with 50% of the funds allotted going elsewhere.  Susie Long died after waiting seven months for a colonoscopy, while Beverly Seville Doyle died on her own in the early hours of the morning while attached to a drip in an accident and emergency unit toilet.  These are but two of the tragedies we have seen last year.</P><Col N="777"/>
        <P>We must also consider some of the other issues that have arisen.  A debacle arose in breast cancer care in Portlaoise because the Minister ignored early warnings from Mr. Peter Naughton in 2005, with the scandalous result that nine women were misdiagnosed with cancer and 97 women were callously left waiting until a cohort &mdash; or a boxcar &mdash; was filled before action was taken.  We had the Barringtons hospital affair in which letters were passed back and forth for 19 months before real action was taken over the breast cancer services offered there.  We encountered problems in laboratories in Cork and Galway regarding a locum pathologist.</P>
        <P>Most recently, a scandal arose in the north east, where locum radiologists were used for several years despite a health board warning in 2001 that this was a major problem.  The problem was highlighted by Judge Maureen Harding Clarke but nothing was done.  The HSE knew about the misdiagnosis of lung cancer when four people died in November 2007 but it waited several months to do anything about it, made a hames of its response and then blamed the problem on a private company.  Approximately 4,600 people have to wait anxiously for eight weeks to find out whether they have a serious medical problem, despite having previously received the all clear.</P>
        <P>The damning Fitzgerald and Doherty reports underscore the dysfunctional nature of the HSE and its inability to deliver safe and effective treatment.  When the Minister announced her cancer strategy last year, she closed 13 centres which provided breast cancer care.  Patients in Ennis were advised to go to Galway or Limerick.  The following week, however, cutbacks were introduced which prompted the medical board of the Galway hospital to state that its five day breast cancer service would be reduced to three days.  That is not reassuring.</P>
        <P>There is the continuing preoccupation with the privatisation of our health service, the co-location of hospitals and, in particular, the recent bizarre decision to outsource cervical smears to an American company which has been found to be recalcitrant in its behaviour.  In 1998, 2001 and 2004, the aforementioned company was fined a total of $40 million for fraudulent claims.  The situation now arises whereby a company which has been fined nearly $500 million in America will provide dialysis for patients in Limerick.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>God help us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Is something wrong with the HSE given that it cannot find a partner abroad which does not have a record of fraud?</P>
        <P>Quest, the cervical cancer screening company, has a margin of error of 15%, whereas our laboratories have a margin of 5%.  A recent comparative study of 14,500 slides conducted by St. Luke&rsquo;s hospital shows that, even accounting for urgent cases, Quest&rsquo;s laboratory has an error rate of 30% in detecting high grade pre-invasive cancers.  That equates to 2,000 missed cases per annum.  Another study conducted in Cork showed an even higher rate of missed high grade smears.  One could argue that a 15% margin of error is acceptable in a country where smears are done annually but it cannot be acceptable here in view of our intention to conduct smear tests every three to five years.  Given our record, the interval will be five rather than three years.  As we will not have a facility for multi-disciplinary team meetings between the smear reader, the cytologist and the colposcopist to discuss cases prior to treatment, we will not be pursuing best practice.  Furthermore, the loss of 100 highly paid jobs will hardly encourage young people to take up science as a career option.  We are going to lose this pool of expertise and it will not be available to us again.  It will have been decimated when we realise in two year&rsquo;s time that we made the wrong decision.  Why is the Minister persisting with this plan to outsource smear tests when medical experts believe that between 1,000 and 2,000 cases of pre-invasive cervical cancer will be missed per annum, thereby putting women&rsquo;s lives at risk?  Will we have another Portlaoise on our hands in a few years time?  Despite all of these issues <Col N="778"/>and the fact that pathologists will have to go abroad to finish their training, the Government is gung ho to go.</P>
        <P>I recently undertook a tour of Castlebar, Sligo and Letterkenny hospitals and University Hospital, Galway.  I agree that a centre of excellence should be established, with proper resources and funding, at University Hospital, Galway.  Mayo General Hospital, Sligo General Hospital and Letterkenny Hospital should operate as satellite units of the Galway centre of excellence.  Mayo General Hospital currently operates as a satellite of University Hospital, Galway, as does Letterkenny Hospital under a locum.  We propose that Sligo General Hospital should operate under the same guidelines and that all hospitals should be audited by HIQA annually to ensure the best outcome for women.</P>
        <P>Professor Tom Keane, who is an expert in his field, is being used as a shield to protect the Government from its own decisions, much as it used Professor Brendan Drumm in respect of the HSE.  Professor Keane has made it quite clear that he is here to implement a programme.  Fine Gael subscribes to the concept of centres of excellence in the same way that I would have subscribed to the concept of the HSE as a single entity delivering health care to 4.2 million people.  However, the manner in which the HSE was established was a disaster given that it in effect amalgamated 11 companies while promising that nobody would lose a job or move positions.  That was an impossible place to begin by any standard.  The Government failed in 2002 to bite the bullet on redundancies and today patients are dying and choking on that bullet.  Once again, I fear that we have an excellent concept for specialist centres of cancer care but we are going about it the wrong way.  Instead of providing the new resource first, the HSE wants to close down two centres that currently give excellent care on a promise of excellence to come in Galway, which is to shut down much of its services for the month of August.</P>
        <P>When I visited Galway regional hospital this weekend, I found its medical and surgical wards to be operating at 100% capacity.  In April 2007, 188 people were on trolleys overnight waiting for beds the following day.  Last month, that figure rose to more than 440.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Shameful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>That is hardly a hospital with sufficient capacity to take on a regional centre.  The &euro;5 million which is to be spent on the eight centres divides into &euro;625,000 per unit, which is not the sort of money needed to deliver the excellence Galway hopes to provide.  These issues arise before I even begin to discuss the parking difficulties experienced around University Hospital, Galway.  Many patients have to park on Headford Road and walk or take a bus to the hospital.  University Hospital, Galway, is already &euro;4.5 million over budget and last year it experienced 30 new cases of MRSA.  This is evidence of overcrowding and a hospital at the limit of its capacity.</P>
        <P>I received a letter which emanated from doctors working in Galway regional hospital.  It is addressed to the management of that hospital and states:</P>
        <P LI="1">We enclose the figures for the number of patients waiting on trolleys for an inpatient bed in the [emergency department] at UHG for the month of April 2008.  You will see that this month we have had a total of 444 patients on trolleys at 9 am.  This compares to a total of 188 for the same period in 2007.  This is an increase of 136% at a time when the HSE is meant to be moving towards a zero tolerance for trolley waits in Emergency Departments, as recommended by the Task Force Report.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">There is no doubt that this continued overcrowding in the Emergency Department is adversely affecting patient care.  Recent independent research from Australia suggests that <Col N="779"/>this persistent overcrowding is resulting in anywhere between 10 to 20 unnecessary deaths per year for a population the size of Galway [assuming a population of 230,000].  The implication that there are one or more unnecessary deaths per month in Galway University Hospital as a result of the persistent overcrowding is a very worrying one.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will not read the remainder of the letter into the record because it is not particularly relevant.  However, the staff at the hospital are highlighting a problem that is being ignored.</P>
        <P>As stated earlier, I do not believe in the ability of the Government to deliver on its promises or even in its political will to do so.  All we need do is consider the position at Mallow General Hospital, where a third surgeon was let go and where patients were told to go to Cork University Hospital.  However, the surgeon at the latter has said he has no additional resources to deal with these people and that they should not come to him.  Therefore, the excellent 24-7 service in place at Mallow General Hospital will be reduced to a nine to five, Monday to Friday service.</P>
        <P>There is also the situation at Monaghan and Cavan hospitals.  When the accident and emergency department at Monaghan Hospital was closed for 18 months, 17 people died on the road between Monaghan and Cavan while bypassing their own hospital.  Monaghan is to close, Cavan is to take the load.  There are 3,000 admissions to Monaghan annually and 5,000 to Cavan.  The latter does not have additional capacity; it has a new ward but no staff.  Cavan Hospital&rsquo;s budget is &euro;9 million down on last year.  Its emergency department is considerably smaller than that in place at Monaghan.  The coronary care unit at Monaghan has been audited by Professor Michael Walsh of St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, who found it to have excellent outcomes.  I mention these facts as further evidence of the Minister&rsquo;s <i>modus operandi</i>, which is to strip away the service people enjoy today on the promise of something wonderful to come tomorrow.  However, tomorrow never comes.</P>
        <P>As has been pointed out by surgeons, the same patients will be seen by the same surgeon, oncologist, radiologist and pathologist in Galway as are now being seen in Mayo and Letterkenny.  How will that improve outcomes?  We know what it will do &mdash; inconvenience and hurt patients and force them to travel long distances.  How does the Green Party feel about this much increased carbon footprint?  At present, all the aforementioned specialists are linked by technology to the centre.  Furthermore, the plans for the Letterkenny satellite centre, which we wish to proceed, are based exactly on the Mayo General Hospital model.  As the manager in Letterkenny informed me, the only difference will be that there will not be the same proximity of access as exists in Mayo.  We want to see the same links established between Sligo General Hospital and Galway University Hospital as those which exist in respect of the other two hospitals to which I refer.</P>
        <P>I return to the issue of trust and the Minister&rsquo;s statement that operations were carried out in respect of only 37 cases of breast cancer at Mayo General Hospital in 2007.  An extensive trawl has been carried out &mdash; this was reviewed by both the manager of the hospital and the surgeon &mdash; and the fact is that 90 cases were dealt with last year.  Of these, 92 were new and three involved recurrences.  Some 73 of these patients were diagnosed and treated at Mayo General Hospital in 2007, six were diagnosed at the hospital and had reconstructive surgery &mdash; involving the surgeon from Mayo &mdash; at University College Hospital Galway and a further six were diagnosed and had appropriate non-operative care at Mayo General Hospital.  In addition, nine patients who were diagnosed in 2007 were treated in 2008.  One further patient who was diagnosed at Mayo General Hospital was treated in Dublin.</P>
        <P>The plan with which we have been presented seems to be based on misinformation at best and disinformation at worst.  One would want to be particularly guileless, gullible and naive to <Col N="780"/>accept the Minister&rsquo;s plan as currently outlined.  I reiterate that the concept of excellence is one we fully support.  However, it is the Minister&rsquo;s manner of pursuing it that we reject.</P>
        <P>Figures have been produced which show that outcomes for breast surgery in the west were 25% worse than was the case on the east coast.  However, these figures relate to the period 1994 to 2001.  It is interesting to note that the breast service at Sligo General Hospital and Mayo only commenced in 2000.  I have in my possession the outcome figures for Mayo General Hospital for 2002 &mdash; they are the latest available &mdash; which show a five-year survival rate among patients of 88%.  This compares very favourably with the European average for breast cancer of 70%, as published in <i>The Lancet Oncology</i>.</P>
        <P>It is suggested that Mayo would lose only two breast cancer operations a week, which would lead one to believe approximately 100 patients a year are being diagnosed.  This is what surgeon and manager of Mayo General Hospital have stated.  However, there are 1,200 new cases seen each year at Mayo General Hospital.  These people will all be obliged to travel to University College Hospital Galway.  This does not include the thousands of reviews dealt with annually at Mayo and Sligo.</P>
        <P>There really is no possibility of what is proposed being achieved at University College Hospital Galway without massive investment being made.  To be honest, I do not think it makes sense to oblige the numbers of people to whom I refer to travel to see the same staff.  The case for satellite centres has already been accepted by the Government in respect of Letterkenny.  Why dismantle the very model on which it was based, namely, that at Mayo, where safe, effective care is being delivered and excellent outcomes achieved?  The motion specifically seeks an audit of all centres and their satellites, thus ensuring best outcomes for women so that a centre which is not performing can be closed.  This is the feeling of the doctors themselves &mdash; that is how confident they are of the service they provide.  The confidence to which I refer is shared by the people.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with the issue of satellite centres in general and the fact there is more than one way to deliver excellence.  The Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, one of the largest cancer hospitals in the world, deals with 2,000 cases a year.  The total number of cases dealt with in Ireland each year is 2,500.  The Sloan-Kettering Hospital has a centre in Manhattan, three satellites and five community-based cancer treatment centres.  So successful is this system that the authorities at the hospital are considering the addition of a further satellite in upstate New York over 100 miles from the main centre.</P>
        <P>The basis of the plan to provide breast cancer care at Galway is that staff will turn patients around in two to five days.  However, the average stay at the Sloan-Kettering unit, which is one of the best in the world, is six days.  Doctors at Mayo and Sligo hospitals can turn patients around in two to three days.  However, they will always encounter difficult cases such as, for example, a lady who lives on the side of a hill and who has no infrastructural support and no family.  Such a woman could not go home in such circumstances, particularly because she would have no one to help change her dressings.  There is no provision in the plan for additional accommodation where patients can be monitored and have arrangements put in place to support their early discharge into the community.  The patients to whom I refer would still have surgical drains attached to them, their wounds would not be healed and so on.</P>
        <P>It has been stated &mdash; it was also mentioned at the ICGP by Professor Tom Keane &mdash; that GPs can be trained in Canada to do this work.  What was not stated is that GPs must be taken off site for two months and replaced by locums.  I informed the Minister previously that there is a manpower crisis in the area of general practice but she refused to make provision for even 30 additional places on the training schemes.  We currently train 120 GPs each year.  However, <Col N="781"/>50% of GPs will retire in the next 12 years and it has been stated that we will need 300 new GPs each year for the next five years just to stand still, not to mention discussing their taking on extra work.  On a personal basis, I would like to see them take on such work.  It will be a long time before we can afford to release GPs for the length of time envisaged in order to allow them to be trained on the schemes to which I refer.</P>
        <P>Everything I have stated is clear evidence that the plan to move to Galway is unsustainable as currently envisaged.  The people of Mayo and Sligo have a safe service and they wish to retain it.</P>
        <P>Voluntary transport services do not offer a realistic option in today&rsquo;s Ireland, particularly when one considers that citizens are time poor and are obliged to commute long distances and spend many hours in congested traffic while travelling to and from work.  How will people find time to offer voluntary travel services to cancer patients?  At &euro;750,000, the budget for travel looks very slim when compared to what I understand to be the &euro;10 million spent annually on transport for kidney dialysis patients.</P>
        <P>The people of Mayo and Sligo have access to a service that is delivering safe and effective care and excellent outcomes.  The authorities at Letterkenny Hospital are evolving their model, which is based on that which obtains in Mayo.  Why does the Minister want to endanger women&rsquo;s lives by closing the service before proving that what is to replace it will work?  All her talk relates to patient safety but all her actions scream &ldquo;Save money, not lives&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to join the Fine Gael Party in proposing this motion on cancer services in the north west.  I welcome those in the Gallery who have travelled long distances to be here to listen to the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to begin by assuring the Minister and Professor Tom Keane that we have no intention of reopening consideration of the cancer strategy or setting it back in any way.  I note that in the media Professor Keane suggested that is what we might be trying to do.  We want to make one change only, a change that we signalled from the start.  We in the Labour Party fully support the proposal to establish so-called centres of excellence, where diagnostic and surgical cancer services and after-therapy will be delivered in designated specialist units, backed up by triple assessment and provided through multidisciplinary teams.  We welcome and embrace the proposals in the strategy designed to improve outcomes for patients.</P>
        <P>We support the work of Professor Tom Keane.  However, Professor Keane will not always be with us &mdash; I gather he will return to Canada in approximately a year and a half &mdash; and we will not give uncritical support to the Minister unless we are satisfied, on behalf of patients, that the necessary resources are developed in each centre to deliver the excellent care to which patients are entitled.  There should also be extra capacity for the increased number of patients who will travel to be treated in these centres.</P>
        <P>I am very concerned because there is no assurance with regard to resources.  There is a famous quote from the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that there was not &ldquo;one red cent&rdquo; to develop a hospital in the north east.  Unfortunately, we have no information that the resources required will be provided in Galway or the other designated centres.  Will we have the staff, beds, theatres and other supportive arrangements required if we are to have centres of excellence in those locations?</P><Col N="782"/>
        <P>Professor Keane is quoted in one of the newspapers today as saying the number of centres is &ldquo;immaterial&rdquo;.  He implies there could have been any number of centres, as he came to implement what had been decided.</P>
        <P>Those who recommended those eight centres are not infallible and their report is not gospel.  It is a matter of fact that a previous expert report suggested 11 centres was the right number.  Who are we to believe?  Who did these people consult and who suggested the eight centres?  What information did they use and who exactly made the decision for eight centres?  Why did they know more than Professor O&rsquo;Higgins and his team, which suggested a larger number of centres a couple of years before that?</P>
        <P>Looking at the map of Ireland, one would have to question why four of the proposed centres are in Dublin while there is none north of the line between Dublin to Galway.  One must question why that decision was made.  That is a very large part of the country with no centre of excellence.</P>
        <P>That aspect of the recommendations is wrong.  I believed that and said so when it was announced and I still believe it.  It is true, as the Minister stated, that people will travel long distances if they know they will get the best service by doing so, but they should not have to travel such disproportionately long distances in the north west in comparison to everybody else in the rest of the country.  It does not make sense that four centres will be in Dublin and none in the north west.</P>
        <P>I question who made these decisions and if they were totally objective in reaching the proposals.  I will refer to an issue in my region.  Only a few years ago, on the publication of the Hollywood report on radiotherapy, we in the mid-west were told in no uncertain terms that we would not have radiotherapy services.  They were to be delivered in four super centres, with two in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway.  The report concluded that the Irish population did not justify having any more centres.  Nobody from the mid-west was on that body, which was large.  However, people in the mid-west and the south east were well aware of the suffering of very ill people who had to travel long distances for approximately six minutes at a time of radiotherapy.  We did not accept the judgment of those who made such decisions safe in the knowledge that they were within a short distance of treatment.</P>
        <P>In Limerick, we fundraised and set up a radiotherapy service which initially paid for both public and private patients out of a fund raised by the Mid-West Hospitals Trust.  When it was up and running and had proved its worth, with a unit in Waterford, it was brought into the approved cohort of service and under the public purse for public patients.  Nobody is saying those units should not be there but they would not exist if we had taken no for an answer and accepted the so-called expert report.</P>
        <P>I will repeat my question.  Why are there four centres in Dublin and none in the north west?  Let us not pretend that these decisions are entirely objective.  Let us not pretend either that a satellite centre in Letterkenny will fulfil the safety criteria but one in Sligo will not.  If the multidisciplinary teams and triple assessment safeguards that are the accepted standards of care can be provided in an outreach centre in Letterkenny, whether linked to Galway, Belfast or anywhere else, they can also be provided in Sligo or Mayo.  Deputy Reilly indicated the safety outcomes with figures he has with Mayo.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party would favour one full, ninth designated centre in the north west.  That has been rejected by Government.  Instead the outreach centre model has been favoured.  If that is to be the model, and the advice to Government is that it is a safe model, it should also be comprehensive in addressing the population of the north west.</P><Col N="783"/>
        <P>The cancer campaigns in the north west are led primarily by patients and medical practitioners.  It is an insult to them to suggest, as has been said before, that any of us is somehow playing politics with this issue.  Those who can be accused of that are the people who say one thing in their constituencies and do something else in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I was present when we had a debate on cancer services approximately two months ago.  People behind the Minister suggested we needed a service in the north west and stood up for their own region.  However, when the Minister replied to the debate she did not refer to those contributions but accused us on this side of the House of playing politics with the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I should be clear.  Whatever we say here we will repeat in the regions.  What I stated on Ocean FM radio a few months ago I am repeating clearly in the D&aacute;il and I stand over it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I stress that we are not in favour of maintaining unsafe services. That is why we only advocate this one exception and why we have included in our motion yearly audits of all designated centres, both full centres of excellence and outreach centres.  The disregard for the lives of women and men who have been misdiagnosed because of bungling, bad organisation and governance, poor resources or ill-chosen locum staff must never happen again.  The lessons of Portlaoise must be learned and the recommendations of the series of reports on misdiagnosis must be rigorously implemented.</P>
        <P>It is an important part of the motion that there be yearly audits of all centres.  There have been a litany of appalling incidents in various parts of the country where cancer has been misdiagnosed.  We had three reports on Portlaoise, the Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley report and the Barringtons Hospital report and we await a report on Cork and Galway.  There have been a litany of reports and serious and important recommendations, and they must be implemented.</P>
        <P>All those recommendations have resource implications.  I hope the Minister will answer the question of where are the resources required to build up the centres.  Where are the resources for Galway and the other centres?  How can patients in the north west with cancer symptoms or those who are worried about the disease be confident that the excellent services they now have confidence in will be replaced by a similar level of service in Galway if their local centres are closed?  We have raised the issue many times in this House but we were never given clear answers on the provision of resources.  We know Professor Keane will return to Canada at the end of next year but we have not been given any assurances that what he sets up will continue in a way that provides the necessary resources.</P>
        <P>I wish to return to the issue of Letterkenny.  It is clearly Government policy that an outreach centre will provide a good and safe service in Letterkenny, which I welcome.  How will the triple assessment and the multidisciplinary teams be delivered in Letterkenny and what is the level of expertise that will be available on-site?  How will the clinicians who will be working in Letterkenny and Galway operate?  I assume the Minister can answer all these questions.  I assume she can stand over the safety of the proposal for an outreach centre in Letterkenny.  If she can answer such questions, I do not understand why these services cannot be delivered in Sligo, in Mayo or in both places.  If the Minister believes services can safely be provided in Letterkenny, surely she can give us answers in relation to the other centres.  That is what this motion is about &mdash; the provision of safe and reliable services in all the centres.</P><Col N="784"/>
        <P>I would like to reflect on the Government&rsquo;s habit of accepting proposals lock, stock and barrel without examining the detail of what is proposed or ensuring that such proposals can be fully implemented.  A report produced by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al several years ago suggested that accident and emergency care be provided in secondary hospitals 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The proposals in the more recent Hanly and Teamwork reports were completely different, however.  We are expected to swallow the various reports whole, without any question.  When it was suggested there should be eight designated centres under the cancer strategy, that plan was accepted and minds were closed.  Those who felt strongly that the plan was jeoparding their safety and care had no opportunity to make the case for their strong belief that some services should be retained in the north west under the cancer strategy.  When we tried to open up a debate to try to have the matter considered, we felt we were beating our heads against a brick wall.</P>
        <P>It is worrying that reports are simply accepted as gospel and that is it.  As I said earlier, the same thing happened when the Hollywood report on radiotherapy was published.  We were told it would be neither sensible, practical nor a good use of resources to offer such services anywhere other than Dublin, Cork and Galway.  We have now shown that an alternative model can work.  It was reported today that Professor Tom Keane has said that far too many patients are being given radiotherapy on an inpatient basis.  If cancer care centres were provided in more locations, radiotherapy could be provided more frequently on an outpatient basis.</P>
        <P>I question the Government&rsquo;s philosophy of accepting reports without question.  Such reports tend to be implemented in a hands-off manner.  I want to refute the suggestion that anyone who questions that approach is somehow mischievous, politically motivated or not working in the best interests of patients.  All of us are primarily concerned with the best interests of patients.  I submit that people in Belmullet and other extreme parts of the north west who have cancer and have to travel for services think that Galway is a long way away.  Therefore, the Minister should open her mind to the development of another main centre, or of a series of outreach centres.</P>
        <P>I would like to comment on another couple of aspects of cancer care before I conclude.  The BreastCheck service has not been delivered to all parts of the country.  While some of the mobile units have been rolled out, not all of them have been.  People in the north west, like people in my own region, have not yet been able to avail of the services of BreastCheck.  It is clear that they are suffering as a result of unequal treatment.  The sooner BreastCheck is rolled out in all parts of the country, the sooner all the women of Ireland will have a fair service.  Last week, the Joint Committee on Health and Children discussed palliative care services, which are unevenly distributed throughout the country.  While the region I represent is one of the better regions in that regard, many other regions are not properly served.  It is a question of fairness, geography and treating patients in the north west with the same level of respect as their counterparts in the rest of the country.</P>
        <P>It is important that the motion proposes that we &ldquo;ensure that all centres of excellence and satellite units are the subject of an annual HIQA audit&rdquo; to ensure they are safe.  We all wish to ensure that the services which are delivered are absolutely safe and fulfil the criteria which have been set out in the cancer strategy.  I urge the members of the Government to open their minds and to give the people of the north west an opportunity to avail of safe cancer services near their homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to express my views on cancer services in the west and the north west.  I commend my party&rsquo;s health spokesman, <Col N="785"/>Deputy Reilly, and my party leader, Deputy Kenny, for highlighting this matter in the Chamber.  It is one of the most emotive issues to have arisen among the people of Mayo and the west for many years.  The motion does not prevent or impede the establishment of centres of excellence throughout the country.  It does not advocate the operation of cancer services that fail to meet the highest standards of audit.  We are not looking for millions of euro to be invested to provide additional services we do not already have.  We are demanding the retention of the cancer services that have been built up passionately and expertly over the years by the consultants, doctors, nurses and staff of Mayo General Hospital and Sligo General Hospital.  These satellite services have operated successfully with a full mandate from the Department of Health and Children and full clinical support from University College Hospital, Galway.  The multidisciplinary approach of the teams at Mayo and Sligo hospitals has ensured that the clinical outcome of every patient treated there stands up to the highest scrutiny.  Professor Brendan Drumm recently acknowledged publicly the high quality of surgical care provided at Mayo General Hospital.  We deserve and will accept nothing less in the future.</P>
        <P>I fully support the provision of a satellite unit at Letterkenny General Hospital, under the responsibility of University College Hospital, Galway, which was rightly recommended in the national cancer strategy on the basis of the particular and unique geographical circumstances of County Donegal.  Why have the geographical circumstances of counties Mayo and Sligo not been taken into account in the provision of cancer services for the region?  Do the decision-makers have any idea of the isolation felt by women in Ballina, Blacksod, Belmullet, Ballycastle, Achill and the islands off the coast of County Mayo?  Are they familiar with the standard of roads and transport services in such areas?  People in such locations can only dream of motorways, dual carriageways, Luas services, rail links and bus services that would get them to Galway efficiently and on time.</P>
        <P>Hundreds of Mayo women who have been successfully operated on, treated and cured at Mayo General Hospital are in the Gallery, along with their families.  Why are their views not being taken into account?  Why is no consideration being given to the views of consultants who have provided services to a high standard in Mayo and Sligo?  Why were Professor Kevin Barry and his consultant colleagues recently forced to publicly support the retention of the existing services at Mayo General Hospital?  Was it as a result of the misrepresentation of their views in this House by the Minister, Deputy Harney?</P>
        <P>Why have the views of the thousands of people who marched in Castlebar last October in support of the retention of cancer services in County Mayo been ignored by the Minister, Deputy Harney?  They have also been ignored by our local Government representatives, Deputies Flynn and Calleary.  The people of County Mayo have been told in recent days that the two Deputies intend to vote against this motion.  The Deputies have suggested that they would prefer to work from within to retain services and get additional ones.  I would be the first to shake their hand if there was evidence of any progress.  I will not be holding my breath, however, if their efforts in this regard over recent months are anything to go by.  They pledged their support to 10,000 protestors in Castlebar last October.  They will have a chance tomorrow night to walk the walk and uphold this pledge.</P>
        <P>A number of other questions need to be clarified by the Minister during this debate.  On a recent visit to Mayo General Hospital to launch the mobile breast cancer unit, the Minister, Deputy Harney, clearly stated the number of breast surgeries performed in Castlebar last year was 37, although the actual number verified by Professor Barry and his colleagues is in the 90s.  Can the Minister stand by her claim even though the certified evidence on the ground contradicts it?  This is not just a difference of six but 60 cases.  Surely the Minister can acknowledge <Col N="786"/>the gravity of this misinterpretation.  How can we be expected to have confidence in a decision based on a misrepresentation of figures of operations performed?</P>
        <P>It is also important to state that the Fine Gael motion supports the HSE and Government policy outlined as recently as December 2006 when it was envisaged that the newly established clinical network between Letterkenny General Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway, would work alongside the Mayo and Sligo hospitals.  What changed between December 2006 and June 2007?  Would it have anything to do with the general election in between?</P>

This transition cannot be achieved within this timeframe without women&rsquo;s lives being put at risk.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I will be sharing time with the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.</P>
        <P>This debate is about cancer services.  The diagnosis of cancer is a terrible experience for individuals, their families and for their friends.  In Ireland 22,000 people are diagnosed each year with cancer and 7,500 people die.  One in three of us will get an invasive cancer during our lifetime.  What are we saying to those cancer patients?  We are saying that we want to offer them in the first instance the best possible diagnosis when they get cancer and the best possible care the country can offer.  We are also saying to them that in offering them the best diagnosis and care, we will use the best evidence available to us to deliver that.</P>
        <P>I was asked earlier who devised the plan, A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland, which was adopted by Government.  There were 23 people involved in devising this plan, 17 of whom were doctors.  There were patient representatives from the Irish Cancer Society and other groups that support patients who have cancer.  They drew on the best expertise in Ireland and the best international expertise.  They brought to Ireland the man known as the cancer tsar from the UK, Dr. Mike Gibbons, and many other specialists from around the world.  Using the best evidence available to them they advised the Government to have eight centres, one per 500,000 people.  The Government adopted the plan in advance of the general election even though many people claimed it would not be popular.  To be fair to the Opposition, both Fine Gael and Labour supported it and welcomed it.  The only question they had about it was whether it would be adequately resourced.</P>
        <P>That is the plan we are now implementing.  The evidence is not my evidence or the evidence of the Government.  Tonight we are talking about breast cancer.  There are 250 different medical publications from all over the world by the world&rsquo;s leading doctors who have treated patients that prove that if a woman is treated in a centre that deals with at least 150 new breast cancer cases a year and if a surgeon is dealing with at least 50 individual cases a year, that woman&rsquo;s chances of recovery are improved by 20%.  That means the difference between four women surviving and only three women surviving.  That is compelling evidence.</P>
        <P>Deputy Reilly referred to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, which I have visited.  He stated it has approximately 2,500 cases a year, which is true and is the same number of breast cancer cases we have in Ireland.  He went on to say that it is going to have three or four different centres for 2,500.  We will have eight centres for 2,500 and we are being criticised for that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The second evidence is domestic evidence in Ireland.  The National Cancer Registry of Ireland, a new organisation established in the early 1990s, has produced two reports on breast cancer, one for the period 1994 -97 and one for the period 1998-2001.  Those two reports show that women treated in specialist centres in Dublin have a survival rate that is 25% better than women treated elsewhere in the country.  Unfortunately the women in the west have the poorest survival rates.  What does that mean?  It means that where four women in a Dublin centre will survive only three women will survive having been treated elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>That information is out of date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is more analysis coming from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland in the autumn.  I understand it is currently collating its report.  The advice available to <Col N="788"/>me is that the pattern will continue.  Either we can ignore that or we can do something about it.  I believe this debate is about the truth.  If we are sick and go to our doctor we want the right diagnosis and a good prognosis &mdash; we want to be told the truth.  We have a moral obligation to tell people the truth.  Already there is significant evidence that people are moving to specialist centres even when local facilities are available.  Yesterday I visited South Tipperary Hospital.  I went to the oncology ward where some men but mainly women who suffer from breast cancer were receiving chemotherapy.  Many of them had their surgery in Waterford because the service has been withdrawn from South Tipperary Hospital and the surgeon has gone to Waterford as a full-time breast surgeon.  When I asked for their opinions, each and every one of them was hugely satisfied with the service and very happy they were having their chemotherapy in South Tipperary Hospital.  Of course, chemotherapy services will continue to be provided in Sligo and Mayo.  Some 55% of breast cancer patients will require chemotherapy and those services will be provided locally in Sligo and Mayo.</P>
        <P>What are we suggesting in the designation of eight specialist centres?  In this instance we are talking about breast cancer because those are the services provided in these two hospitals.  For a patient&rsquo;s initial diagnosis and surgery, she will be treated in the specialist centre and thereafter her care, having been planned in the specialist centre, by way of chemotherapy will be delivered locally.  That can provide for cancer patients a quality-assured service.  Ireland is 18th out of 23 in our performance on cancer in Europe.  Our survival rates are improving and as we saw from the recent OECD report in breast cancer they have improved by just under 7%.</P>
        <P>However, in treatment of children&rsquo;s cancer we are ahead of the United States and Europe because we have one specialist centre at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin which has been there for 50 years.  All the diagnosis happens there.  The initial surgery happens there.  The follow-up treatment, although planned there in accordance with a protocol can be delivered in 16 other hospitals around the country.  We have proved with children&rsquo;s cancer when we keep the expertise and specialist doctors together dealing with high volumes of patients, we get better outcomes and results.  That is what this debate is about.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been asked about satellite centres in places like Letterkenny.  The reason for the advice to create a satellite centre in Letterkenny is that we are conscious that Donegal is the most peripheral part of Ireland.  If it was not for the political divide on the island we know what the obvious solution would be.  We have been in discussion with the authorities in Northern Ireland on providing joined-up services as far as cancer is concerned for patients of the north west.  The Government has already secured radiation oncology treatment for patients in Belfast City Hospital, the one centre in Northern Ireland for radiotherapy and one of the best in Europe.  Recently the Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mr. McGimpsey, MLA, announced plans for a new centre in Altnagelvin.  We hope to be able to join with the Northern Ireland authorities in using that facility for patients from Donegal and, I hope, patients from Sligo.  The reason the satellite centre is going into Donegal on an exceptional basis is due to its peripheral location.  The centre will be fully integrated with Galway and the staff will rotate from Galway to Donegal.  We could not possibly have the staff in Galway rotating to three satellite centres.  We all know that it would not be a specialist centre if there were three satellites with staff rotating to three different places.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to have an argument about patient numbers because quite honestly it is not just about numbers.  We have two sources of data for numbers.  One is the HIPE data, which <Col N="789"/>is the patient information and inquiry system.  That is the method we use to pay hospitals.  Those data are compiled at hospital level as patients are discharged.  They are verified and collated by the ESRI.  The other source of data is the cancer registry, which provides data on cancer patients on a county by county basis.  Those are two authoritative sources of data based on people who have had breast surgery procedures in Mayo General Hospital for the year in question &mdash; 2006, when there were 43 procedures.  A total of 77 women from Mayo got breast cancer and 43% of them were treated in either Dublin or Galway.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct.  Eight women had that last year with the surgeon from Mayo going to Galway to assist.</P>

	<P>Deputy Reilly.</P>

	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Half of the women concerned were able to have that surgery at the same time as the mastectomy or the lumpectomy.  Unfortunately, they cannot have the two procedures together in Mayo or Sligo because it requires the skills of a plastic surgeon or a specialist surgeon.  Professor Kerin in Galway does it but he is unusual.  Generally, it requires a plastic surgeon to be available also.  It is desirable to carry out both operations at the same time, if the opportunity can be provided, instead of asking the women concerned to come back a second time and to go to Galway or Dublin for a second experience of surgery, which we know is not recommended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not happen.  Women are assessed and brought to Galway for surgery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I say this especially as a woman.  There is nothing a woman fears more than getting breast cancer.  That is a fact.  There is nothing a woman would not do if she had breast cancer in order to have it cured.  Women would travel almost anywhere if they were told their chances would improve by 20% or 25%.  I know of no woman &mdash; and I have spoken to many of them &mdash; who would not travel&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>They would if that were true, but Galway cannot cope and the Minister knows that.</P>

	<P>Deputy Reilly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to get the best possible care.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with the question of Galway coping with the numbers.  Galway currently has six beds for breast surgery and it will probably have to increase that to eight to provide services for the rest of the region.  That is what we are talking about.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan constantly asks me about resources.  When Professor Keane was asked to take over the implementation of a plan similar to ours in Canada, he was told by the Prime Minister there that, unfortunately, due to difficult times no new money could be provided.  This year we have allocated &euro;5.8 million to Professor Keane, which is what he asked for.  Currently, he is recruiting at least 22 cancer specialists for the health care system.  One can ask why it is important that we get those specialists.  We are over-dependent on units with one individual, which is not good because if the individual is on leave we have to get a locum.  Our system is far too dependent on locums and other issues arise in that regard.  The first priority is to recruit the manpower by way of consultant specialists into the cancer control programme and that recruitment is under way.  Thankfully, the new consultant contract, which was voted on overwhelmingly last week by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, will allow us to have consultants work in a way that better meets the needs of the public health care system working in teams with clinical directors.  That programme is under way.</P><Col N="791"/>
        <P>Second, there are issues around how patients are referred.  Professor Keane is working with the Irish College of General Practitioners, which has responsibility for training and education among general practitioners.  As Deputies are aware, last weekend Professor Keane addressed the annual conference of the ICGP.  He is working with it on referral protocols so that any urgent case can be seen within two weeks.  That is a good international standard and one we want to see implemented here.  If we separate what can broadly be called routine cases from urgent cases we will be able to achieve that.</P>
        <P>I am the first to accept that the current transport arrangements between, for example, Sligo and Galway are not satisfactory.  Professor Keane has allocated &euro;0.75 million this year to the Irish Cancer Society because in other countries it is patient organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society that are seen to be the most suited to put into effect appropriate transport for patients.  That is in addition to the transport arrangements we already have in place.  The idea is to provide more modern and convenient transport facilities.</P>
        <P>Professor Keane made the point himself about accommodation at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, that we have four times more inpatient beds for radiation oncology than what is available for a similar population in Canada.  Many of the patients need not be in an acute hospital environment.  They could be in a hotel-hostel environment, which would be much more satisfactory from the point of view of the patients and from the point of view of being cost effective, which is important in terms of getting resources to invest in the appropriate area.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s cancer programme is not universally popular.  I know that, as I have had discussions with people in Sligo and Mayo.  I was happy to meet an excellent group of women &mdash; all of whom had breast cancer &mdash; when I visited Mayo recently.  I know how strongly people feel about the issue.  We all feel strongly about it.  No Minister for Health and Children worth his or her salt or who is worthy of the job, could fail to stand over the implementation of a plan based on best international evidence.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I say to Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan that when Professor O&rsquo;Higgins produced his proposals seven years ago the international evidence was that a centre should deal with 100 new cases a year.  That evidence has now changed to 150 new cases a year.  As we know in regard to breast cancer, the developments taking place globally have been described by oncologists as revolutionary.  The information, medicine, pharmaceutical products etc., are changing rapidly, which is why much better outcomes can now be achieved.  We have to respond to those changes if we want to deliver the best possible quality-assured services for patients.  That is what the Government is doing.  That is all the Government is doing.  The Government is not withdrawing anything to put in something inferior.  It is looking at the best evidence, putting in place in 2008 the best possible cancer services this country can afford, and making sure in particular that as many services as can be quality assured are provided in local hospitals, such as chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy services will continue to be provided in Sligo, Mayo and in many of the other hospitals where surgery is moving to the specialist centres.</P>
      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>We are talking about specialist centres, not centres of excellence.  We are talking about centres where all the specialists in cancer care, pathology, radiology, surgery, medical oncology and so on work as a team around the highest possible number of patients to ensure they can see every possible scenario from a patient perspective.  We want every health care setting to be a centre of excellence but we want surgery and diagnosis, which are the two most important aspects, to be done in the specialist centre.</P>
        <P>Of the 100 women who will attend a breast clinic, only five will have to have a biopsy or follow-up treatment.  Ninety five people will never have to come back again.  That is the evidence and it is very good.  We are saying that out of every 100 women from Mayo or Sligo, five <Col N="792"/>of them may have to come back for a biopsy and, of that number, perhaps two or three will have to have further treatment.  If in doing it that way we are able to guarantee those women that instead of only three people surviving four people will survive, I believe that is a risk worth taking and it would be irresponsible of any of us to stand in the way of its implementation.</P>

	<P>I would be impressed if Deputy McCormack could find anybody on his side of the House who has not read a script.  He might find a few of them.</P><Col N="793"/>
        <P>On the perspective of women, it is understandable that they have concerns about changes to the traditional arrangements for their care.  Women in Mayo and Sligo currently enjoy rapid access to their local hospital service when they require it.  They are familiar with their local hospital.  They often know the nursing and medical staff and have a high regard for them.  They know other women who have had breast cancer and who have had it successfully treated in their local hospital.  They fear having to rely on a service that is further away and less personal.  Understandably, they worry when doctors or public representatives tell them they will get a poorer service.</P>
        <P>From the perspective of general practitioners, in Mayo and Sligo they have a long-established relationship with their local hospitals, as is the case with hospitals in towns throughout the country.  They know the consultants personally and regularly meet them at clinical meetings and in other settings.  That close personal relationship provides local GPs with the security of having access to a good quality and trustworthy clinical opinion when they need it.  It also provides them with the means of being able to have patients seen speedily when they are worried about them.  They value that access and do not wish to see it compromised.</P>
        <P>The Minister wishes to reassure all women that the service they receive in the west will be of the highest quality and that it will be there when they need it.  Under the cancer control programme the services will be organised to meet everyone&rsquo;s needs and the proof of a better service will be seen from the beginning of the new arrangements.</P>
        <P>It is important to explain what the new arrangements will mean.  For women who have breast cancer, travel will be required only for the initial assessment in the clinic, as the Minister said, and again for the surgery.  In the case of women who require chemotherapy, this can be delivered at both Mayo and Sligo hospitals in accordance with protocols set out by the multidisciplinary team based in Galway.  Far from countless visits involving long journeys, it will be possible for women to have the great majority of their care locally.  All of us must reflect on whether we feed into a spiral of fear among patients who are already suffering a trauma in their lives for narrow political aims.</P>
        <P>The multidisciplinary teams in the designated centres will carry out high case volumes.  In surgery for breast cancer, for example, each centre should carry out a minimum number of 150 such surgeries. There should be no form of the disease that the surgical team has not seen.  The team should predict complications and should be familiar with all relevant investigations and treatment for the disease.  People attending the centres will know they are in the hands of highly skilled consultants and nurses who have access to all the resources necessary to achieve the best results possible in terms of survival rates.</P>
        <P>In all the local debate, we must not lose sight of what we want to achieve, the best possible outcome for patients.  The reorganisation of cancer services is at the heart of the delivery of the national strategy for cancer control, which was approved by the Government in 2006.  Patients enjoy an improvement of up to 20% in survival if they are treated in specialist centres which provide multidisciplinary care.  The new configuration of services will allow for the delivery of quality assured patient focused care, which will be in keeping with international best practice and the highest standards.</P>
        <P>The major focus of the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s implementation plan to date has been on breast cancer services.  Since 2000, more than &euro;60 million has been made available for the development of symptomatic breast disease services nationally.</P>
        <P>In June last year the Minister approved national quality assurance standards for symptomatic breast disease services under the Health Act 2007.  The implementation of the standards is an <Col N="794"/>essential element of the quality agenda set out in the national cancer control strategy.  The aim of the standards is to ensure that every woman in Ireland who develops breast cancer has an equal opportunity to be managed in a centre which is capable of delivering the best possible outcome.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;5.8 million has been allocated from the programme in 2008 across the eight centres to support additional staff, including consultant, radiography, nursing and clerical posts.  Funding has also been allocated for some necessary additional equipment.</P>
        <P>Changes of the kind being implemented are difficult.  They lead to concerns about local services and an understandable fear that the new will not be as good as the old, but we are not alone in dealing with these changes.  Canada, like Ireland, has very sizeable areas that are sparsely populated and patients there often must travel hundreds of miles to attend for treatment.</P>
        <P>The decisions on the location of the eight designated centres have been made, taking account of travel times, proximity to large urban centres and the ability of the centres to recruit and retain top clinicians.  The availability of multidisciplinary teams and up-to-date technology is also very important.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the designated centres will require further development.</P>

	<P>One Irish person in three will develop invasive cancer, while one in four will die from it.  Currently there are approximately 22,000 new cases and 7,500 die of the disease.  We are aware that the number of cancer cases is expected to increase, largely as a result of population changes, from less than 14,000 in 2000 to over 28,000 in 2020.  We must, therefore, ensure that the health system has the capacity to deal in a timely, quality assured fashion with the increasing numbers of patients presenting for diagnosis and treatment.</P>
        <P>The House is well aware of the reviews into failures in cancer service provision, where due to lack of appropriate standards of care such as the absence of a multidisciplinary team to diagnose and determine treatment options, cancers were missed.  We must change the system.  We must provide quality assured cancer services and optimise survival rates, and that can only be done by realigning the current fragmented services and concentrating resources for diagnosis and initial treatment in the eight designated centres.</P><Col N="795"/>
        <P>Local hospitals are a cornerstone of health care provision.  They have huge, untapped potential in many cases, especially for day surgery and follow-up treatments.  In cancer care, however, initial diagnosis by a multidisciplinary team, which has access to state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques and pathology, is the key to improving survival rates.</P>
        <P>I strongly believe that the best way to improve cancer survival rates is to implement the national cancer control programme.  I join the Minister in calling on this House to endorse the programme fully.  We must concentrate on developing the designated specialist centres and stop arguing over local issues, be they political or medical.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not a doctor and I am not here to argue for a centre for the midlands, even though Professor O&rsquo;Higgins said clearly that we had the critical mass to have such a centre.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy John Maloney, has faced up to considerable pressure and adapted to a situation that was to his political disadvantage.  Nonetheless, he faced up to it in a fair manner and I acknowledge that here tonight. </P>
        <P>The Census of Population 2006 shows clearly that the choice of cancer centres of excellence bears little relation either to geography or the population structure of Ireland.  That is the problem I have &mdash; I am not arguing about the midlands but addressing the motion about the north west, Sligo and that area.</P>
        <P>There is no centre north of a line from Galway to Dublin, leaving ten northern counties and about 18% of the population a considerable distance from such a centre.  That is a considerable proportion of the population and I wonder why there has to be four centres in Dublin.  It is grand for me because I can avail of the good road from Mullingar.  However, for someone in a remote rural area who must first navigate boreens before getting to a tertiary road, then hopefully hitting a secondary road before gaining access to a primary route, it is extremely difficult.  Those are the people I am concerned about.  It is all right for many of us who can get from A to B.  It might solve many of the problems if a proper air ambulance service was introduced.  It is no use having one, just piddling around here and there.  We need such a service across the country for all health services.</P>
        <P>I want to know how such a strange result could have come about because it does not arise from the basic philosophy for health care in Ireland set out with admirable clarity in the national health strategy in 2001:</P>
        <P LI="1">Access to health care should be fair.  The system must respond to people&rsquo;s needs rather than have access dependent on geographical location or ability to pay.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Would the ten northern counties believe they have fair access to the specialised services in terms of geographical location?  In terms of the genesis of the problem, two major reports provided the groundwork for the decision on cancer centres, the Hanly and Hollywood reports.  The Hanly report was officially about medical staffing and how to ensure compliance with an EU directive for junior doctors.  However, it spread out like an amoeba and went into other areas such as medical education and training, organisation and location of acute hospital <Col N="796"/>services, ambulance services, etc.  Many of these issues were only covered in a superficial manner, especially the decision that there should be only one major hospital in each region.  Accident and emergency, as well as other services, should be centralised in this hospital while other hospitals would become 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five-day a week care centres.  The Hanly report states on page 68 that, ultimately, there should not be a requirement for an on-site medical presence overnight or at weekends.</P>
        <P>The most amazing thing about this influential report is that it did not take demographics or geography into account.  I am not a medic and I am not here to politicise the issue &mdash; I would say this if the Labour Party was in Government &mdash; but it does not make sense to plan for a medical reorganisation of hospital services without knowing where people live in Ireland.  I was criticised widely for proposing to reduce the number of accident and emergency departments and so on.  However, a TCD research group found that the percentage of those in the country able to reach an accident and emergency department within an hour would fall from 82% to 72% and increase from 44% to 47% in the west and north west of the country.</P>
        <P>It is surprising that Hanly ignored the 2002 report by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al, the statutory body advising the Minister on the organisation and operation of hospital services, which showed in detailed analysis that Ireland needed all its 38 accident and emergency units to provide adequate and timely care for the victims of major accidents, heart attacks and so on.  Its main argument was about the &ldquo;golden hour&rdquo;, which all the doctors here know about &mdash; seriously ill patients have a much better chance of survival if initial treatment and stabilisation is given within the first hour of an emergency.  The most recent international research on accident and emergency services, published in 2007, confirms very strongly the principle of the &ldquo;golden hour&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Hollywood report on radiology services was much more research based, but still has serious flaws in its analysis and conclusions.  It put great emphasis on the decision to centralise radiology services in Dublin and Cork, with another centre already agreed for Galway.  That obviously affected the recent choice of multidisciplinary cancer centres of excellence &mdash; that is its origin.  The objective was to ultimately balance the potential conflicting aspirations of bringing the service to the patient or the patient to the service.  The authors set out two models of care, the hub and spoke, where diagnosis and major care is given in the large centralised hospital, with more routine care given under supervision in a small hospital close to the patient&rsquo;s home.  It recommends the centralisation of all radiology services, with just three centres for the whole country.  It gives three major arguments for deciding on centralisation for Ireland and all of them are deeply flawed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The hub and spoke model is used successfully in Scandinavian countries where there is a low density of population.  However, it was argued in this report that Ireland&rsquo;s population density is much like that in the UK or the Netherlands, which use centralisation and, therefore, centralisation would be more appropriate for Ireland.  That is so stupid that I cannot believe it was included.  Norway had 14 residents per kilometre in 2005 and a population of 4.6 million, while Sweden had 20 residents per kilometre and a population of 9 million and Denmark had 126 per kilometre for its population of 5.4 million.  Iceland has 3 residents per kilometre, with a population of 296,000, while Ireland has 59 residents per kilometre for a population of 4.2 million.  The UK has 245 residents per kilometre and a population of 60 million, while the Netherlands the 389 residents per kilometre and a population of 16.3 million.  In terms of residents per sq. km and total population, Ireland is much more like the Scandinavian countries than the UK or the Netherlands.  That is fact.  With respect to the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="797"/>Barry Andrews, it has been a great mistake for Ireland to slavishly follow UK medical trends over the years, especially in terms of hospital structures, catchment areas, etc., when in so many ways Ireland is so unlike Britain.</P>
        <P>I will not even talk about the fact that the Hollywood report relied on a postal survey of the attitudes of cancer patients.  Do not draw me out on that one.  Some 2,500 patients were treated in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and more than 700 were treated in Cork.  When one has a postal survey, what does one get?  A majority of the survey&rsquo;s findings should have come from Dublin, because that is where 3.5 times the cancer population was treated.  I will not even comment.</P>
        <P>However, the authors of the report expressed concern that if there were satellite centres to give treatment closer to where people actually lived, the medical personnel in these centres would feel very isolated.  If they feel lonesome, they can avail of mobile phones.</P>
        <P>The hub and spoke system requires very close networking between the major centre and its satellites, with much direct contact among all staff to maintain standards and discuss patients.  It would be much more reasonable to ask a few fit and healthy medical personnel to travel occasionally to the central unit or the satellite units in order to prevent feelings of isolation instead of forcing thousands of seriously ill patients to travel long distances every day for weeks on end, as in the centralisation model.</P>
        <P>In my view, those major reports which provided the groundwork for the decision on the new cancer centres both suffer from many significant shortcomings &mdash; I have only pointed out some of them.  Chief of these is the total lack of interest in, or perhaps lack of knowledge of, Ireland&rsquo;s unique demographic structure.</P>
        <P>I will conclude with two major points about the multicentre cancer centres of excellence &mdash; it is inappropriate to term them centres of excellence because it implies that all other hospitals and institutions lack excellence.  Excellent services can be found in many hospitals, large and small, throughout the country.  It is unfair to suggest that excellence in cancer care is only available in a handful of hospitals in the southern part of Ireland.  The correct term, as referred to by the Minister, is multidisciplinary centres.  The objective, which everyone should support, is that the primary diagnosis and treatment planning for all cancers should take place in a centre where there are experts in radiology who are familiar with the many diagnostic tools necessary for investigating cancer.  Experienced cancer surgeons should work together to provide all the necessary preliminary investigations to define both the problem and the best treatment.</P>
        <P>As the Minister said, no one should complain about travelling a distance on a number of occasions to have the benefit of a multidisciplinary team working on his or her cancer problems.  However, it is important to ensure that the poorer members of society, the elderly, disabled and those who are isolated, have adequate State support to enable them visit the multidisciplinary centre without inordinate difficulty or financial loss.</P>
        <P>The big issue in respect of the fact that the cancer centres are not new is that existing hospitals have been asked to take on the additional burden of new and expanded cancer services although these centres, in common with those of the entire acute hospital sector, have fewer beds per 1,000 citizens than in most other developed countries.  There are 2.8 per 1,000 while the OECD average is 3.9 per 1,000.</P>
        <P>The provision of public health care, of which I am very proud, boils down to a choice.  For 26 years, our capital investment in health care was only 63% of the EU average; need we say more?</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Reilly for tabling this motion.  The Minister for Health and Children asked for truth in this debate and I will therefore state a few home truths.</P>
        <P>Over recent years, 13 cancer centres have been closed on the basis that cancer patients would receive better treatment and have higher survival rates by transferring services to regional services.  The cancer services provided at Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe and Roscommon County Hospital form part of the service in our regional centre based in University College Hospital, Galway, UCHG.  Local public representatives, including me, accepted the regionalisation plan in good faith on the basis that the Government would not dare mess with people&rsquo;s lives by under-resourcing cancer services.  We soon found that the transport service that had been provided to cancer patients was withdrawn.  Consequently, they had to try to make their own way to Galway, which, for some of my constituents, involves a journey of three and a half hours.  The lack of public transport means patients must get their spouses to take days off work and arrange for relatives or neighbours to pick up their children from school just so they can have the pleasure of queuing for up to an hour to get into the hospital carpark.  This is after surviving the traffic congestion in and around Galway city.</P>
        <P>As a result of the reduction in the number of surgical cases in Portiuncula Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital, the HSE is now planning to transfer the department of surgery in the latter to the former as an interim measure before centralising all inpatient surgery procedures in an already congested UCHG.</P>
        <P>We were told there would be more local outpatient clinics, with the consultants doing the travelling and examining patients in Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals rather than having the patients trek to Galway.  This commitment was abandoned.  One affected clinic is the urology clinic in Roscommon County Hospital.  Since the health authorities would not sanction the &euro;50,000 needed to purchase three sets of cystoscopy equipment to carry out the physical examination, patients must still travel to Galway to be examined.</P>
        <P>We were promised that local post-treatment services would be enhanced but the opposite occurred.  I refer to the withdrawal of home help services and home care packages.  To top it all off, we found out last week that the HSE cancelled the plan to develop an eight-bed hospice service at Roscommon County Hospital in addition to the day care and outpatient services, at a total cost of &euro;8 million, half of which was to be provided by the Mayo-Roscommon Hospice Foundation.  The HSE claims it has reprioritised the investment.  Last year, Roscommon County Hospital catered for 90 palliative care patients, and many other patients from County Roscommon were treated in other hospitals.  The HSE&rsquo;s decision means patients with terminal cancer must now wait for one of the 14 beds in Galway or one of the 14 planned beds in Castlebar to become available.</P>
        <P>We now find that, although there is a great backlog of patients for cancer diagnosis in UCHG, that hospital will close down for the full month of August because it is facing a financial deficit of &euro;4.5 million.  So much for our centres of excellence and the commitment that was made to deliver excellent services to the communities in which services have been closed down.  The current plan will double the number of patients attending UCHG by closing down the services in Mayo and Sligo.  UCHG cannot even cope with the demand being placed on it by patients in Roscommon and Galway, never mind those in the north west who will now be thrust upon it.</P><Col N="799"/>
        <P>In her contribution, the Minister stated two additional beds will be provided at UCHG.  This will cater for the two operations per week that are taking place in Mayo but will not cater for the patients of the north west who are currently being treated in Sligo.  No additional capacity has been provided to cater for this.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, stated further investment is needed in the so-called centres of excellence in Galway and that the funding will be made available over the years ahead.  It is clear that the excellent services in Mayo and Sligo will be cut.  These services resulted in survival rates above the averages in any other hospital in Europe.  We are told we will have an adequately resourced service some time in the future but we have the facts regarding what is happening in my county and know the same will happen in Mayo and Sligo.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputies Kenny and Reilly on raising this very important issue in the House.</P>
        <P>In outlining my position, I will depict the more human side instead of facts and figures, although bearing in mind that the facts and figures the Minister cited pertain to the period 1994 to 2001.  In this day and age, we should have more up-to-date figures on this very serious issue.</P>
        <P>Eight years ago my father suffered kidney failure and had to be brought to Sligo three days per week.  We come from a very mobile and well-off family and it was great that he could go to Sligo, just 25 miles down the road, and then come back.  Each day, when I saw him coming back tired and jaded after being on dialysis, I shuddered to think of what would have happened had he had to go to Galway.  Unfortunately, victims of cancer must travel to Galway, and they spend two or two and a half hours doing so.  One would not get through Claregalway or Tuam without difficulty.  Last Sunday it took me two hours to get into Galway.  Having to travel so far is a great hindrance and problem for patients.</P>
        <P>This debate is not about point scoring and politicians are elected by the people.  Patients, medical practitioners, families and friends come to us as politicians stating they attended so many public meetings and protest marches in Sligo and Castlebar, and marches to Leinster House.  People have taken the time to come to Dublin to listen to this debate tonight because we are approaching the endgame of a charade that has gone on too long.</P>
        <P>I have sometimes nearly been embarrassed by members of the Government shouting they are with the people outside the House while adopting a stance against them in the House.  It is very difficult to be in government in such circumstances.  I genuinely feel for the Senators and Deputies from the constituencies involved because it is very difficult to implement national policy.  For once, we must have a little honesty in the House.  What has happened has undermined the public perception of politics.  There are Deputies present tonight with a heavy heart.  I ask the Taoiseach to allow an open vote on this very important issue in the D&aacute;il, and likewise in the Seanad when it discusses the matter.  Thus, Deputies and Senators can show where they stand on this very difficult matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On coping with cancer, one of the Mayo Clinic&rsquo;s top ten tips states, &ldquo;Try to maintain your normal lifestyle.&rdquo;  How can one maintain a normal lifestyle when oneself and one&rsquo;s family must drive the whole way to Galway and come back the next day?  The clinic advises, &ldquo;Take each day at a time. When the future is uncertain, organizing and planning may suddenly seem overwhelming&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>There is a line between Dublin and Galway, above which there are centres of excellence in Castlebar, Letterkenny and Sligo.  We now want to ensure there is one in the north west.  The people of the north west deserve much better than what is being recommended.</P><Col N="800"/>
        <P>With regard to the protest marches that have taken place, it is up to the Government to listen to the people and to govern.  I ask it once more to please respect the wishes of the families and patients in the north west and ensure they have a centre of excellence.  I ask the Taoiseach once again to allow an open vote on this very serious matter.  I will applaud the Deputies and Senators of the Oireachtas when they participate in that open vote.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that the Minister for Health and Children did not remain in the House for a few minutes longer.  I cannot think of anything more important than the health and concerns of the people, 4,600 of whom have been asked to wait a maximum period of eight weeks before finding out the exact position regarding their X-rays and CAT scans.  It is of fundamental importance to our society that when an error is made or health misdiagnoses take place, there is complete transparency, openness and honesty in respect of what happened.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is time for the Government and the Health Service Executive to think again.  It is time to concentrate on shortening considerably the maximum eight-week waiting period before learning one&rsquo;s correct diagnosis.  There are many ways to so do, some of which have been discussed by the HSE and some of which have not.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and his boss, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, have a duty of care to all the people affected to ensure this waiting period is as short as possible.  They must wait for eight weeks, or 56 days and nights, although the original X-ray may have been taken more than a year ago.  If something is wrong, people cannot afford to wait.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The health service in its entirety, including doctors and radiologists, must act in concert with the HSE, the Minister of State and the Minister &mdash; who would not wait five minutes for Members &mdash; to ascertain whether the waiting period can be abridged and whether something can be done to sort it out.   Why can this not happen within one week or immediately?  There is no reason people should be obliged to wait for eight weeks - one would not wait eight weeks for a tooth filling.  Thankfully, the majority of those concerned have been told there is nothing wrong with them.  However, many of those who have been in contact with my colleagues and me have had cancer in the past.  Many have put behind them breast or lung cancer and have had X-rays in the interim.  Such people are deeply worried about what is happening at present.  They suffer anxiety and sleepless nights, and their families also are worried.  It was not good enough for the Taoiseach to state today that a precautionary principle is being applied and that eight weeks is okay.  It is never okay and never will be acceptable.  That it has come to this is a disgrace.</P>
        <P>This happened because there was no oversight and no audit.  I have to hand Ms Justice Maureen Harding Clark&rsquo;s report into the Dr. Neary affair.  Dr. Neary got away with his actions because there was no audit of his work.  While I do not suggest the consultant in this instance is in the same realm, the key point in the Harding Clark report stated there must be clinical audit of all consultants in the system.  However, no clinical audit of the work of the man concerned took place and this is the reason these people are suffering tonight.</P><Col N="801"/>
        <P>I wish to make two further points.  Although what took place was bad enough, the Government also messed up the mail merge.  The health service has 100,000 employees, as well as an entire Department of Health and Children.  However, faced with the obligation to contact 4,600 people, the mail merge was outsourced and given to a company that could not deliver.  It messed up the mail merge and sent the wrong letters to the wrong people, including letters to people who are deceased.  Not only did it send a first letter, it also sent a second letter.  Today I received a telephone call from the family of a person who was in her 90s when she passed away.  They had previously received two letters addressed to her but today they received a telephone call asking that she go to the hospital to have her X-ray examined.  This demonstrates how appalling this mess is.</P>
        <P>The Government has demonstrated it does not care.  The Minister will not even wait to discuss what is the most important issue to have arisen in my region for many years.  It is an absolute and total disgrace.  The Taoiseach has stated he is a republican and has spoken of the new Republic.  I understand he has used words such as &ldquo;equality&rdquo;, &ldquo;brotherhood&rdquo; and &ldquo;fraternity&rdquo;.  In a republic other than a banana republic, equality of treatment above all else would mean emergency action in this case.  One would press all the buttons to ensure these people were looked after and would ensure that no head would lie on a bed worrying about his or her diagnosis for a single night longer than was necessary.  This is the key.  However, the Health Service Executive could not care less and is not accountable and the Minister will not sit and listen to Members for five minutes.</P>

	<P>In the course of the career in politics of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, he should learn the lesson of the example provided tonight by his senior Minister.  Her walking out at the outset of this debate is deplorable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and gives a very bad signal to the people of the north east, on whom she has already turned her back repeatedly in respect of the health issues of concern to them.  I have to hand one of the letters sent out by the Health Service Executive to thousands of people in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath.  It was received by one of my constituents in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan.  The woman in question is willing to share the information that at the best of times she is prone to anxiety and stress.  One can only imagine her distress when she read this letter.  She now faces two months living in fear and trepidation as she awaits the outcome of the review of her case.</P>
        <P>One of the first things that must be done by the Minister for Health and Children is to provide the resources to expedite the reviews and to shorten the agonising waiting time for patients.  Some letters from the HSE have arrived months after the person in question has died as a result of cancer, greatly adding to the grief of their loved ones.  While the HSE originally stated that four people who were misdiagnosed had died, I understand this figure could prove to be as high as ten.</P>
        <P>This issue first came to public notice with a report in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 30 March that the HSE in the north east was considering a review of radiology services, possibly involving the rechecking of thousands of scans for cancer.  Given the experience of women in the midlands, this was of major concern to those in the north east who had undergone such scans.  Concerns were expressed directly to me at that time.  On 31 March, the HSE issued a statement indicating that a limited review was under way.  The HSE did not state the exact nature of the <Col N="802"/>tests involved and it was unclear whether the HSE had contacted patients who might have been affected.  There was no clarity for patients, even though the HSE stated that the requirement to inform patients and their families must take precedence over all other considerations.  I stated at the time that there should be no repeat of the mismanagement and lack of information that surrounded the midlands cancer screening scandal.  I also stated that inadequate resources and facilities for oncology in the north east had been highlighted repeatedly by frontline staff and that cancer services in this region required significant enhancement.  I regret that from what has been learned subsequently, this appears to be a repeat of the midlands scandal.</P>
        <P>A locum radiologist was employed by the HSE from August 2006 to August 2007.  My Sinn F&eacute;in colleague on Louth County Council, Councillor Tom&aacute;s Sharkey, has highlighted how a man in his constituency was X-rayed in May 2007 and was sent home after being given the all-clear.  On 14 November 2007, however, he was re-admitted to hospital and X-rayed.  On this occasion, the radiologist on duty immediately recognised cancer on the X-ray.  The second radiologist checked the May 2007 X-ray result and realised it was clearly shown on that one too.  The patient in question was told he had cancer only when he went to another hospital for further treatment.  X-rays of this man were taken hours before his death and the family have never been given a proper explanation as to how this tragic case was handled.</P>
        <P>The locum radiologist who worked from August 2006 to August 2007 lives in Scotland.  In the Irish edition of the <i>Mail on Sunday</i> of 18 May, he alleged he was being scapegoated.  He stated he knew nothing about X-rays being recalled, as no one had informed him of the review.  He also stated, &ldquo;Why I am being singled out for all of these supposed mistakes when there were others in those hospitals who also saw the X-rays bewilders me.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>What was most significant in this report was the alleged comment from a person described as a senior source close to the review who said other members of staff had also viewed the X-rays of some of the patients who later died and had also missed the cancer lesions.  The source is quoted as saying there were other weak links in the chain.  Another source who attended the meeting held after the diagnosis of one patient said the oncologist&rsquo;s age was a major factor in his being singled out by the review team.  This raises very serious questions.</P>
        <P>We hear a lot about clinical governance and the better management of our health services.  Are we looking at a cover-up of the systems failure for which the current Minister and successive Ministers are ultimately responsible?  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, must ensure complete and comprehensive information is provided, including by way of a public inquiry if necessary, on the systems failures that have led to the terrible situation facing thousands of people in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath.</P>
        <P>We need an explanation for the delay in acting on this matter after it first came to the notice of the HSE.  Coming in the wake of previous cancer diagnosis reviews, all of this highlights the failure of successive Ministers, the Departments and the HSE to ensure the delivery of the best care for all patients at all locations where cancer services are provided.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P>The HSE has instigated a look-back review of all chest X-rays and CT scans reported on by one locum consultant radiologist, who worked in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda and Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan between August 2006 and August 2007.  This decision was <Col N="803"/>made following expert clinical advice from Ireland and the UK and an examination of the cases raised.  This review is being done as a precaution and as a reassurance for patients.</P>
        <P>The look-back review was prompted by concerns that four patients in two Louth and Meath hospitals during 2006 and 2007 had their diagnoses delayed due to an abnormality on their chest X-rays not being noted on initial examination.  These patients were subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer by follow-up X-rays and have all passed away.</P>
        <P>The Minister was informed in March of this year that the HSE, following further examination of the issue, was considering a separate look-back review regarding the work of that radiologist.  The HSE issued a press release on 31 March following media reports concerning radiology services in the north east.  That press release was based on the information available at the time.  In its subsequent assessment of the situation, and taking into account the advice of external experts, the HSE agreed that the look-back review would include 70 CT scans.</P>
        <P>Planning for this review commenced at the end of March 2008.  A steering group was formed by the HSE on 9 April 2008 to oversee the radiology review.  From April to 14 May, the steering group undertook preparatory work which included defining the methodology for the look-back exercise, sourcing radiologists to undertake the look-back, arranging indemnity for the reviewers, developing the process and resources for the look-back exercise across two X-ray departments in Navan and Drogheda and establishing the communication needs around the review and putting plans in place to meet them.</P>
        <P>Chest radiographs are performed for many reasons &mdash; most are done for respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, asthma, pneumonia, accidents, injuries, chest pain and heart failure.  A small number are done for possible lung tumours, but the majority of patients who are being checked are extremely low-risk and are included as a measure of prudence.</P>
        <P>Numerous challenges arose throughout this planning phase, particularly with regard to securing radiologists in Ireland who would undertake the look-back in association with the Louth and Meath radiologists.  Following a review of options available, including external companies in the UK to undertake the look-back, a decision was made to proceed with an internal-external mixed panel of radiologists from Louth, Meath and Northern Ireland.  The look-back review commenced on 15 May 2008 and it is expected that it will be completed within eight weeks.  As each X-ray and CT scan is reviewed, the HSE will write to the patient to let him or her know the result of the recheck.</P>
        <P>The HSE announced today in a media statement that, in the context of this review and during the last three weeks, two people already receiving treatment for lung cancer were identified to the review team.  These people were found to be part of the original group of 4,500 patients to be reviewed.  The HSE has advised the Department that, since these two people were identified, the focus has been on checking on their current status and care and assessing their significance in the context of this review.  Before contact was made with the families of these patients and information provided to their families, it would have been inappropriate ethically and medically to make any public statement with regard to these cases.  The HSE has been making contact with the families concerned since Friday, 16 May 2008 and continues to do so.</P>
        <P>The HSE has also advised the Department that information confirmed by a HSE official to public representatives yesterday pertaining to these two cases was not in line with the HSE policy of not releasing any detail of the review or the people concerned until the review process is complete.</P>

	<P>An information line has been put in place and people affected by the review can make contact with the HSE directly.  The number is 1850 241850.  In patients&rsquo; interests and in keeping with the lessons learned from previous reviews, neither the HSE nor the Department will report any further on specific details of the reviews until they have concluded.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputies that it is vitally important we ensure the delivery of best cancer care for all cancer patients.  This is the reason this Government is totally committed to implementing the HSE national cancer control programme.  The programme will offer equal access to all patients to the expertise of cancer specialists working together in major centres serving large numbers of patients.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>It is also important people are fully aware that where diagnosis and treatment planning are directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, much of the treatment, other than surgery, can be delivered in local hospitals.  Chemotherapy and other aspects of follow up care will be carried out at local hospitals.  This will involve significant realignment of cancer services to move from the present fragmented system of care to one that is consistent with international best practice in cancer control.</P>
        <P>It is time to recognise that we cannot achieve high standards for cancer services by trying to provide a full range of services in centres that do not provide multi-disciplinary care and have very low volumes of patients.  With the implementation of the national cancer control programme we are moving towards a more equitable system that can produce better outcomes than the existing system.</P>

	<P>The issue in question is the urgent need for the Government to address a crisis that has arisen due to the pulling out by McNamara Construction from contracts for five regeneration projects.  This is not only about building homes; this is about regenerating five communities in this city and the knock-on effect for other communities who wait in hope for regeneration projects.  </P>
        <P>I believe the decision by McNamara Construction is a vote of no confidence in the public private partnership route Dublin City Council took, encouraged by the Government.  In a previous life this Government, with Deputy Martin Cullen as Minister, rejected a community plan developed for St. Michael&rsquo;s estate, despite the plan originally having the support of Dublin City Council.</P>
        <P>The Government must now renew the confidence of these communities in regeneration &mdash; it must fill the gap and take charge of all five projects.  The Government must underwrite this scheme to the extent that it not only builds social housing, but affordable housing and private homes also.  It must also provide the facilities promised to St. Michael&rsquo;s estate, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Se&aacute;n McDermott Street, Dominick Street and Infirmary Road.</P>
        <P>I reiterate a call made by Councillors Cr&iacute;ona N&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh and Christy Burke today.  I call on Deputy Michael Finneran, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with responsibility for housing, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan and even the Taoiseach to visit these areas and talk to the residents.  They have put up with a great deal since these regeneration projects started.  They have put up with devastation and disadvantage in the hope that their dreams would come true.  Those dreams <Col N="805"/>have now been shattered.  I wish Ministers would come to these areas and live there for a week to see the effect this decision has had.  The Government has not taken this matter seriously.  There is a crisis and it needs to be addressed with greater urgency than it has shown so far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for being here.  I have lived and worked in St. Michael&rsquo;s in Inchicore all my life.  For the past 18 years I have been hearing about the plan for the regeneration of St. Michael&rsquo;s estate.  I have been a member of the board of St. Michael&rsquo;s for the past eight years.  On numerous occasions plans have been brought to the table and rejected.  The plan recently abandoned, a public private partnership in conjunction with McNamara Construction, had brought great hope to people.  People thought they were finally going to get homes they could live in, that they would be part of a community, and that they would have facilities that were badly needed.  It would bring a new beginning and, above all, a new social agenda.  People living in the community need to be re-educated, to participate in programmes for working in the community, and to have homework clubs.  It was to be the start of a new life.</P>
        <P>Yesterday a shock wave went through our community.  The hopes and dreams not only of those living in St. Michael&rsquo;s estate but also those in the wider community of Inchicore were shattered.  Through the years, Inchicore has put up with many problems, including at one stage the closure of many shops due to the huge drug problem in the area.  Things have since improved and at this stage people are seeing light at the end of the tunnel.  However, yesterday the project was again put on the back burner.  I am not here this evening to blame the board, Dublin City Council, the developer or even the Government.  I am here to request sincerely that the Government consider this issue.  It is now time to make a decision for those people who have remained in St. Michael&rsquo;s estate for the last number of years, some of them in quite difficult conditions.  If it were not for the fact that Dublin City Council has improved living conditions in St. Michael&rsquo;s to a certain extent I dread to think what it would be like.</P>
        <P>I believe the project, which was started two years ago, is not lost and that there is a chance it can be completed.  I want this to happen, as do the people living in Inchicore and the residents of St. Michael&rsquo;s estate.  I want the Government to honour the commitment that has been given to the residents of St. Michael&rsquo;s estate to improve their lifestyle, to go forward together and to give them a new vision of what regeneration is about &mdash; a new life and a new beginning.  The Government needs to step in and support the regeneration project.  It should support the board and those in the community who have played a major part in the project.  I am not here to roar and shout but to request on behalf of those living in St. Michael&rsquo;s estate and Inchicore that this project, which is so badly needed, be revitalised and that the Government step in and take the issue seriously.  I am fed up coming into this Chamber with requests under Standing Order 32 that are rejected.  This is a matter of national importance and I seek the Minister of State&rsquo;s reassurance that something will be done for all of us who have put in so much work in the area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>With my two colleagues, I wish to raise this important issue and seek intervention by the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>It has come as a huge shock to the people of the north inner city that McNamara Construction and Castlethorn Construction have suddenly decided to withdraw from their public private partnership agreements with Dublin City Council.  The hundreds of tenants of O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Infirmary Road, Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street and Dominick Street, not to mention St. Michael&rsquo;s estate on the south side where the project has been promised for a even longer <Col N="806"/>period, are shell-shocked on hearing that their long-promised homes and facilities are now less likely to materialise.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must outline his plans to assist these devastated local communities which are dependent on the successful delivery of the PPP model.  He must outline the implications for Dublin and for other cities and towns in which the same PPP model is being promoted.  He must also state the level of binding legal commitment in the agreements reached between the city council and the private developer and whether the city council or the State has any legal recourse.  The Minister must state whether this devastating news has implications for the successful delivery of other projects within his brief which depend on the PPP model.  We have heard that a number of these projects are also in jeopardy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The retiring Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Purcell, speaking last Sunday night on &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo;, urged the Government to be cautious in its use of the PPP model.  The fact that so many projects in Dublin should have been agreed at the same time with McNamara Construction and should collapse at the same time needs to be explained.  My main concern is for the hundreds of tenants of the four project areas in my constituency who feel absolutely betrayed.  They and their representatives have patiently worked to plan the regeneration projects hand-in-hand with the developers and the local authority over recent years.  The local authority must organise meetings with them to reassure them that the social, affordable and community housing aspects of the projects will be retained and that these homes will be constructed.  There is an immediate need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make that commitment.</P>
        <P>I welcome the new Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Michael Finneran, and congratulate him on his appointment.  I want to be the first to invite the Minister of State to come to Dublin Central, attend our meetings, visit the estates and meet the residents.  I would like the Minister of State to come with the ability to make a financial commitment that the social, affordable and community development aspects of the projects, which have been in the pipeline for so many years, will be delivered in the not too distant future.  It has long been promised that at last this public private model would be successful.  I ask the Minister to make such a commitment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  The fact that three Deputies are combining to speak on this issue reflects its importance and the very real concerns about the regeneration process in the areas affected.  The regeneration of estates is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, and more than &euro;120 million has been provided from the Exchequer in 2008 to aid this process.  This is in addition to funding from the private sector and from local authorities&rsquo; own resources.</P>
        <P>I remind the house that Dublin City is a very active and successful authority in terms of regeneration.  The Deputies will be aware of Dublin City Council&rsquo;s track record in the successful regeneration of inner city flats complexes as well as its role in overseeing the substantial regeneration programme under way in Ballymun.  The Ballymun regeneration project itself, which was the subject of a recent report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, is one of the largest developments in the State and has been brought about through a combination of public and private money, construction expertise and management skills.</P><Col N="807"/>
        <P>We should not forget the contribution to regeneration arising from the work of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, which has so visibly transformed the inner city of Dublin.  The Fatima Mansions regeneration project is nearing conclusion and is a clear demonstration of Dublin City Council&rsquo;s successful implementation of the public private partnership model.  The project involved the demolition of 364 largely vacant flats and will deliver 150 new local authority homes, 70 affordable homes and 395 homes for sale on the private market.  The redevelopment also includes enterprise space, a community centre, commercial space, a leisure centre and general infrastructural and landscaping works.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Public private partnerships are part of a range of options used by Dublin City Council to renew and regenerate its social housing estates and provide new social and affordable housing in the city.  PPPs are a way of promoting sustainable development by encouraging social, income and tenure mix in an economically efficient way.  The partnership model is based upon Dublin City Council optimising the use of its existing land holdings to leverage private finance.  The developer in turn provides the local authority with an agreed number of social and-or affordable housing units and funds the overall development in whole or in part from the sale of the housing units to the general public.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that public private partnerships are by no means the only mechanism being employed by Dublin City Council to advance its ambitious social and affordable housing programme.  Significant Exchequer resources are also being provided and the council was recently allocated more than &euro;250 million from the 2008 social housing investment programme, including &euro;65 million for the regeneration of Ballymun.  In the past five years, Dublin City Council has completed more than 3,000 social housing units outside of the regeneration programme and Ballymun.</P>
        <P>On Monday, 19 May 2008, Dublin City Council announced that its PPP regeneration projects with Castlethorn-McNamara in St. Michael&rsquo;s estate and O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and with McNamara on Dominick Street, Convent Lands in Se&aacute;n McDermott Street and Infirmary Road would not go ahead as planned.  The current economic climate and the substantial changes that have recently occurred in the residential housing sector have, according to the developers, rendered these projects non-viable.  The council is working with its tenants to explore options for regenerating the five areas affected by the announcement.  It will meet the three regeneration boards involved in St. Michael&rsquo;s estate, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street to explore all options and to consider alternative plans to deliver the social housing needed in those areas.  The original apartment blocks in St. Michael&rsquo;s estate containing 346 flats are substantially vacated, with 23 families remaining.  The immediate priority will be to ensure that this process will continue and new homes will be found for the remaining families, pending the area&rsquo;s regeneration.  Further physical work is scheduled in O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens where four vacant blocks are due for demolition.</P>
        <P>The next step is for Dublin City Council to examine all of the social, economic and legal implications of the recent announcements and to table alternative proposals so that the regeneration process can proceed.  It is important to remember that procurement processes are under way in respect of other PPP projects in other areas of the city, which will help in informing the way forward.  My Department will actively engage with the council in terms of alternative proposals for the projects.  It will also consider the wider implications, if any, for the approach to PPPs generally.  At this point, it is too early to try to detail the factors that have led to this situation, beyond noting the obvious fact that market conditions have changed significantly in the past six months.  However, this matter must be examined in depth to allow my Department to consider the wider implications for the PPP regeneration programme as a whole.  What is clear is that we will still need private enterprise, in whatever form it takes, to help build sus<Col N="808"/>tainable mixed communities.  There is no going back to the era of large mono-tenure social housing estates, with all of the consequential concentration of economic and social deprivation.</P>
        <P>All the options for progressing the projects raised by Deputies are being examined by Dublin City Council.  I assure the Deputies that my Department will continue to engage with the council actively with a view to moving these projects forward as quickly as possible.  As someone who worked for many years with the Dublin health authority, I know the areas well.  It is my intention to visit the different locations during the coming days and weeks.</P>

	<P>Virtually all commercial felling is undertaken on foot of a General Felling Licence, issued in accordance with the requirements of the Forestry Act 1946, and it is a standard condition of such licences that all areas felled must be replanted.  The Deputy does not ask for details in respect of any particular period, but by way of illustration, General Felling Licences for the clear-felling of 637.5 hectares of trees on privately owned land have been issued during the period 1st January 2006 to date.  This figure is exclusive of clear-felling licences issued to Coillte Teoranta.</P>
        <P>The duration of validity on these licences can range from one to five years.  Under the replanting conditions attached to each licence there is a compulsory requirement to replant the cleared area within 12 months of expiry of the licence.  In accordance with the conditions laid down, it would be expected that 100% of such areas would be replanted, unless a smaller area had been agreed for environmental reasons.</P>

        <Quest>  if further efforts to protect Irish fishing rights will be re-negotiated following the ratification of the Lisbon treaty; the way the principle of subsidiarity will be of benefit to the Irish fishing community within the framework of the Lisbon treaty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>In practical terms, the Reform Treaty will not alter the arrangements that currently apply in the fisheries sector to any great extent other than applying the principle of co-decision in certain areas for the first time.  Fisheries are now included in the Articles on the Common Agricultural Policy and references to the Common Agricultural Policy will be deemed to include fisheries.  The Reform Treaty introduces the principle of qualified majority voting to certain new areas but the principle of qualified majority voting is already enshrined in the fisheries sector for some considerable time.  While there will be some alterations to the thresholds for reaching a qualified majority under the new arrangements, these alterations will not have significant implications for decision-making.  The reality is that most decisions on fisheries are arrived at by consensus.</P>
        <P>However the Treaty will provide a greater degree of democracy in the decision-making process and the European Parliament will have a greater say in future EU legislation on fisheries with the exception of a small number of dossiers related to fixing of Total Allowable Catches and quotas.  Our own Oireachtas also will have an enhanced role under the Lisbon Treaty along with the national Parliaments of the other Member States and these changes apply equally to the fisheries sector.  National parliaments will have a longer period of time to scrutinise proposals.  They will also have the power to object to a draft proposal on the grounds that it breaches the principle of subsidiarity.</P>
        <P>However, in relation to fisheries, a significant exception will be the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, which will be dealt with by the Council of Ministers on a proposal from the European Commission, as is the current process.  Total Allowable Catches and Quotas for the majority of commercial fish stocks in European waters are proposed by the Commission each year for the following year, taking account of scientific evidence on the state of each stock, the respective management measures in place, and the catches taken during the year.  These proposals are the subject of extensive negotiations at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council each December.  During the negotiating process, and indeed throughout the year, I will be taking a strong line in defence of Ireland&rsquo;s shares of the various stocks, as have my predecessors.</P>
        <P>The annual process of setting TACs and quotas is a very important part of the management of fish stocks.  Decisions in relation to quotas are necessarily made on a short-term basis and must react to ever-changing circumstances.  While there are moves to &ldquo;front load&rdquo; this process, in order to facilitate earlier decision making each year, it will not be directly affected by the Lisbon Treaty.  Under the Common Fisheries Policy, each Member State is responsible for the control of fishing activities within its own Exclusive Economic Zone waters and for the development of its own fishing industry and this will continue to be the case into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.</P>
        <P>In terms of fresh fruit and vegetables, there is a legal obligation to display the country of origin for fresh fruit and vegetables.  The EU currently has 36 specific marketing standards <Col N="811"/>covering various fresh fruit and vegetables.  Apart from quality criteria these standards also set down strict provisions regarding labelling; these include country of origin.  The Agricultural Inspectorate in my Department ensures these standards are met.  The EU Commission is currently reforming the Common Organisation of the Market for fruit and vegetables with the objectives of simplification, reduction in legislative burdens, consumer protection and transparency in trade.  As part of this process, it is intended that a number of the existing 36 specific standards will to be replaced by a general standard.  Under this General Standard produce must be of sound, fair and of marketable quality.  While this reform is not yet completed, I am satisfied the proposed General Standard will still set down sufficiently detailed provisions regarding labelling.</P>
        <P>In the case of the importation of meat and meat products, there are specific requirements that such products must originate from a country approved by the EU, have been produced in an approved establishment and be accompanied by a health certificate in accordance with the provisions of Community legislation; in addition such products must be presented for inspection at an EU approved Border Inspection Post.  Furthermore, there is compulsory beef labelling legislation in place since September 2000 which stipulates, among other things, that the origin must be placed on the label.  There are also EU Regulations in place for poultry meat, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level.  The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of the slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pig meat, poultry and sheep meat.  This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation in not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  However, it indicated that it would reconsider the draft measures once we have submitted additional explanatory information.  This information is currently being prepared for transmission to the Commission.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission reviewed the whole area of food labelling and in that context my Department contributed to Ireland&rsquo;s submission which was co-ordinated by the Department of Health &amp; Children.  The Commission subsequently brought forward a proposal for a regulation on the provision of food information to consumers.  This draft regulation will be examined by Council of Health Ministers and the European Parliament under the co-decision procedure.  The FSAI proposes to initiate public consultation on this proposal from July to October this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The worldwide increase in the price of commodities such as cereals and oil over the last 18 months has caused the price of compound animal feeds and fertilizers to increase by about 30% and 50%, respectively.  My predecessor has taken steps, through the Council of Ministers, to address some of the causes of these increases by bringing about a suspension of the obligation to set 10% of arable land aside and the elimination of import duties for cereals, as well as the introduction <Col N="812"/>of an aid for private storage scheme and an increase in export refunds for the pigmeat sector. I can assure the Deputy that my Department is giving all the support it can to the feed industry, including to the importers of animal feed, to allow it to carry on its business because its success is vital to the success of our livestock industry.  However, imports of feed materials must meet all the necessary legislative requirements.</P>
        <P>In relation to fertilizers, Ireland has to import its requirement for all the inorganic fertiliser as there is no national production.  The fact that worldwide demand considerably outstripped supply resulted in the significant price increase.  On a positive note, the indications are that the world fertiliser shortage will be short term.  The FAO circulated a press release in February 2008 entitled: &ldquo;Global fertilizer supply expected to outstrip demand&rdquo;.  In it the FAO expects world fertilizer production to outstrip demand over the next five years.</P>

	<P>The Commission proposals on the Health Check of the CAP are due to be published on 20 May. Advance copies of the proposals have been received in the last few days.  The negotiating process will commence under the Slovenian Presidency with a series of Working Groups in May and June.  My aim in the negotiations will be to achieve the best possible outcome for Ireland and for agriculture.  We have already outlined the issues of concern to Ireland to Commissioner Fischer Boel, to Commission officials, and to colleagues in other Member States.  I will continue to take an active role in the discussions at every opportunity and to reiterate our priorities.  These include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Ensuring that further simplification of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and cross-compliance is delivered;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In preparation for expiry of milk quotas in 2015, seeking ambitious annual quota increases and clear, predictable decisions taken at this stage to give policy certainty to producers and the industry;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Maintaining effective market management measures to cater for any market volatility that may occur</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Opposing the proposed increase in compulsory modulation.</P>
<P FLI="0">I will also be seeking a degree of subsidiarity in a number of areas but specifically in relation to the management of the Single Payment Scheme, to adjust policy to national circumstances.</P>
        <P>The impact of the whole package of measures on Irish agriculture will clearly depend on what is agreed at the end of the negotiations.  The aim is to reach agreement at the November meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  A consultative process with key stakeholders has been established to advise on the main issues arising in the Health Check and the output from this will feed into Ireland&rsquo;s position in the negotiations.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to supporting research in non-food land uses.  To date, it has awarded in excess of &euro;6 million in funding for biofuel research projects under the Department&rsquo;s Research Stimulus Fund Programme arising from Calls for Proposals issued in 2005, 2006 and 2007.  The 2005 Research Stimulus Fund Programme funded a project entitled &lsquo;Development of a strategy (E-supply) for bioethanol production to support the evolution of a non-food crops sector for Irish agriculture&rsquo;. Part of this project quantified existing feedstocks and potential availability for conversion to bioethanol, including sugar beet.  It also examined bioethanol production costs.  My Department is closely monitoring the progress of this research project  which is due for completion at the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The 2007 Call for Proposals under the Research Stimulus Fund Programme invited proposals in the Agri-Energy area to identify and develop within the agriculture sector, renewable energy sources with feasible exploitation potential.  No projects on sugar beet were submitted.  My Department is currently in discussions with other stakeholder Departments on the priority topics for 2009.  Research into non-food land uses will continue to be a priority.</P>

	<P>The arrangements for REPS 4 are derived from a new Commission Regulation which reflects the Commission&rsquo;s objective of integrating and harmonising the operation of the various farm payment schemes &mdash; including the Single Payment Scheme, REPS and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.  For REPS 4, this means that applications to join the Scheme must be submitted by 15 May each year.  Payments will relate to the number of months in a year during which the farmer is in a REPS 4 contract, and they will be released in two phases of 75% and 25%.</P>
        <P>My officials had intensive discussions about these new rules with the Commission.  They argued that the previous arrangements had worked well since REPS was first introduced in 1994 and had contributed to the success of the scheme, with nearly 60,000 farmers participating in REPS 2 and REPS 3 by the end of 2006.  The Commission were adamant, however, that the new Regulation must apply to REPS 4.  The only thing they were prepared to concede was a transitional arrangement for farmers in REPS 2 finishing their contracts during 2008.  As long as these farmers submitted an application for REPS by the closing date of 15 May &mdash; last Thursday &mdash; they can submit their farm plans later on and still receive payment this year.  The Commission insisted however that the new Regulation must apply strictly to all other farmers joining REPS 4 this year, and to everyone joining the new Scheme from next year on.</P>
        <P>The previous discussions with the Commission were exhaustive and I see no prospect of any change in the position.  Although payments will now come at different times of the year from those that farmers are used to, no farmer will lose out on his or her payments in REPS 4.  Nevertheless I am aware that this change is unwelcome to farmers.  I believe the previous way of doing things was better, but we are constrained by the Regulations.  Finally I want to reiterate that there is no change to the rules governing REPS 2 and REPS 3.  For the remainder of their time in these Schemes, farmers will continue to be paid in full at an early stage in each year of their contracts.</P>

	<P>As custodian of some of the richest fishing grounds within the European Community, Ireland is strongly committed to the protection of our fish stocks from depletion due to over-exploitation, both at European and national levels.  At EU level, Ireland has consistently argued for a level playing field in the enforcement of measures to prevent such over-exploitation, and we look forward to participating fully with other member states in the review of Control Systems planned for later this year.</P>
        <P>At national level, enforcement of all regulations regarding over-fishing within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Economic Zone (and by Irish-flagged vessels anywhere in the world), is a matter for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA), an independent authority, which was established on January 1st 2007 under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006. The Act clearly provides that the Authority is independent in the exercise of its functions.  Fish stocks in the waters around Ireland are exploited under the umbrella of the EU Common Fisheries Policy.  A fundamental principal underpinning this policy is to manage the exploitation of the fish stocks in a way that protects their long-term viability and encourages the recovery of the stocks.</P>
        <P>Ireland has and continues to participate in a number of initiatives to encourage the recovery of fish stocks, particularly in proximity to Irish and U.K. waters.  For example, in relation to the cod stocks in the Irish Sea, a pilot project is ongoing on Discards/Enhanced Data Collection, involving fishing vessels from all the coastal areas around the Irish Sea.  This study has been developed collaboratively between fishing industry representatives, scientists, the North West Waters Regional Advisory Committee and the national administrations from Ireland, England and Northern Ireland.  A cod recovery plan was introduced at EU level in 2004 establishing measures for the recovery of four cod stocks in the North-east Atlantic Ocean.  That plan set total allowable catches (TAC&rsquo;s), limited fishing effort, restricted mesh sizes and closed fishing areas with a view to allowing stocks to recover to sustainable levels within a 5-10 year period.</P>
        <P>The slow progress made towards achieving the cod recovery plan&rsquo;s goals has now prompted a re-examination and revision of the original cod recovery plan.  A revised proposal for enhanced measures to promote the recovery of cod stocks was presented by the European Commission at the April 2008 Agriculture and Fisheries Council of Ministers.  This revised proposal, which now proposes to include the Celtic Sea, is being considered by my Department at present in conjunction with our scientists and the industry.</P>
        <P>Other recovery measures around our coasts include areas for the protection of orange roughy and juvenile hake in waters off the south-west coast and new management measures for herring stocks in the Celtic Sea proposed by our industry with the assistance of the Marine Institute.  Ireland is committed to playing a full part in any necessary management measures in that regard, as we have done in the past and continue to do. Our common goal is to have a sustainable fishing industry with sustainable fish stocks.</P>

	<P>The Commission has proposed a Thematic Strategy for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.  The Strategy includes a number of initiatives designed to reduce the negative impacts associated with use of &ldquo;Plant Protection Products&rdquo; (agro-chemical sprays). It is in this context the Commission has proposed:</P>
        <P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />A framework Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides, the aim of which is to reduce the risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment.</P>
        <P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />A new regulation concerning the placing on the market of &ldquo;Plant Protection Products&rdquo;.  This proposal is designed to replace Council Directive 91/414/EEC (the current legislative instrument in place).</P>
        <P el="5">3. <Miles com="ix" />A new regulation concerning the collection of statistics on the use of pesticides in agriculture.</P>
        <P el="10">1.  <i>A framework Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">In December last (2007) a common position in Council was achieved regarding the proposed framework directive on the sustainable use of pesticides.  The agreed text was subsequently discussed by the jurist linguist group in March and final endorsement of the Council position was given at yesterday&rsquo;s Council meeting.  This final endorsement allows the initiation of the second reading process where the Council and the Parliament can engage directly.  The main elements of this proposal relate to issues such as operator and advisor training, inspection of application equipment and national action plans.  Accordingly Ireland endorsed the current proposed text at Council.</P>
        <P el="10">2.  <i>A new Regulation concerning the placing on the market of &ldquo;Plant Protection Products&rdquo;</i></P>
        <P el="0">This proposal is designed to replace Council Directive 91/414/EEC (the current legislative instrument in place).  The current proposal was also addressed at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels but the meeting failed to reach agreement because of the continuing differences between Member States on elements of the proposal.  This proposal currently includes many novel provisions which I support, including the regulation of parallel trade and simplified provisions for data protection. However, it also includes a provision for &lsquo;hazard-based cut-off criteria&rsquo; as a mechanism for making decisions relating to the approval of fungicides, herbicides and insecticides.  If unchanged, this provision could result in a significant reduction of the number of substances available for plant protection in Europe. At the conclusion of yesterday`s Council, the Presidency undertook to &ldquo;take stock&rdquo; of the position and reflect on the outcome of the meeting.</P>
         <P el="10">3. <i>A new regulation concerning the collection of statistics on the use of pesticides in agriculture.</i></P>
        <P el="0">The 3rd proposal is still at Council working group level and officials from my Department are participating in these discussions.  The current proposals will not result in any changes to current practice in Ireland.</P>

	<P>At its meeting on 12 June 2007, the Council of Agriculture Ministers invited the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a school fruit scheme based on an impact assessment of the benefits, practicalities and administrative costs that would be involved.  On 18 December 2007 the Commission began a public consultation process which ended on 29 February 2008. The Commission is currently working on its impact assessment report of different options for EU intervention and it is expected that it will present a proposal to Council in July.  I look forward to the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal and I will certainly support an initiative to increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables among schoolchildren as I believe that this will have long-term health benefits for the upcoming generations.</P>
        <P>In this context I should point out that a national programme (&ldquo;Food Dudes&rdquo;) designed to increase consumption of fresh fruit &amp; vegetables among school children during school time and at home as well as a change in parental behaviour towards purchase and consumption of fresh fruit &amp; vegetables was introduced in 2007. This programme, which is funded by my Department and operated by an Bord Bia, rewards repeat tastings and has proven quite successful.  Some 625 schools and 85,000 children will receive the programme this year.</P>

	<P>All fishermen are eligible to undertake Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) training programmes including those serving on vessels that are decommissioning. In this regard, BIM and F&Aacute;S have agreed to co-operate to provide training for fishing vessel crew members that find themselves without a job when their fishing vessel is decommissioned. Both agencies will work closely together to provide retraining, up-skilling or diversification opportunities in the seafood industry or elsewhere in the economy as required.</P>
        <P>In addition, funding will be provided within BIM&rsquo;s overall programmes to support the sustainable development and improvement of the quality of life in fisheries areas as part of an overall strategy that will support the implementation of the objectives of the common fisheries policy, in particular taking account of its socio-economic effects.  The measures for sustainable development of fisheries areas shall seek to:</P>
        <P>(a) <Miles com="ix" />maintain the economic and social prosperity of these areas and add value to fisheries and aquaculture products;</P>
        <P>(b) <Miles com="ix" />maintain and develop jobs in fisheries areas through support for diversification or the economic and social restructuring of areas facing socio-economic difficulties as a result of changes in the fisheries sector;</P>

	<P>Recent data from the Central Statistics Office on the Consumer Price Index shows that Ireland, in common with the rest of the world, has experienced a steep rise in food prices.  The cost of food and non-alcoholic beverage prices increased by 8.1% in the year to April 2008. This compares to an increase of 1.6% for the year to April 2007 and mirrors the upward trajectory in food prices as evidenced globally and across Europe throughout 2007 and into 2008.</P>
        <P>Changes in food prices are primarily a function of market forces operating at international, EU and national levels. Consistently strong economic growth in developing countries is the main driver of changing world food demand towards high-value agricultural products and processed foods.  Slow-growing supply, low stocks, and supply shocks at a time of increasing demand for feed, food and fuel have led to price increases globally. Biofuel production has also contributed to the changing world food equation. In common with the EU, Ireland is not impervious to this evolving change in context.  In addition, rising input costs, at both producer and processor levels have fed through to put upward pressure on food prices. Pressure on input prices, in particular energy and raw material including feed costs, has combined with strong competition on world dairy and cereal markets in increasing producer prices.</P>
        <P>In response to this situation the EU Council of agriculture Ministers has suspended set-aside, in order to increase cereal production, and has recently agreed a 2% increase in milk quota for 2008. Further measures are being considered in the context of the current discussions on the &lsquo;&lsquo;Health Check&rsquo;&rsquo; of the CAP. A consultative process has been formed to advise on all aspects of the Health Check and the long-term future of milk quotas. This involves the main industry and farming stakeholders as well as independent experts and will feed into the ongoing debate on all the issues concerned.</P>

	<P>All clear felling of afforested areas is subject to the licensing conditions as laid down under the Forestry Act 1946.  Licences are issued following detailed inspection and approval of the proposed clear felling sites by the Forest Service Inspectorate and following consultation with the relevant authorities. There are two types of licence, a general felling licence which carries a compulsory replanting condition on the cleared land and a limited felling licence to which a replanting obligation is normally, but not always, attached.</P>
        <P>I understand from Coillte that the information requested is not readily available but that the area not replanted is very small in the context of Coillte&rsquo;s estate of in excess of 445,000 hectares.   My Department is also carrying out an audit of certain Coillte plantations, licensed under the general licensing procedure, to ensure that the replanting obligation has been fulfilled.  In <Col N="818"/>relation to limited felling licences, my Department has given derogations from replanting for silvicultural and environmental reasons.  Examples of these are the Western Blanket Bog and Raised Bog LIFE projects and the Priority Woodlands LIFE Project.  There are also a small number of individual sites where derogations have been given on the replanting obligation.</P>

	<P>The escalation of fuel costs, as a result of global economic and political conditions, remains a matter of concern for all sectors of industry. It is important to note that the fishing industry in Ireland already receives favourable treatment in the form of a full rebate on excise and VAT on marine fuel, if the enterprise concerned is registered for VAT.</P>
        <P>Fuel subsidies, in terms of operating aid for fishing vessels, are not permitted under EU State Aid rules and any such measures introduced by EU Member States would be in breach of EU law and subject to Infringement proceedings in the European Court of Justice.  It is understood that previous measures taken by France in relation to support to offset the difficulties faced by its industry arising from high fuel prices are the subject of infringement proceedings in the European Court.  Within the EU State Aid rules and the funding available to each, it is a matter for each Member State to put in place measures to support and develop the fishing industry.  I understand that the main measures now being put in place by France include a tax on fishery products at the market place to fund the development and restructuring plan for the fishing sector.</P>
        <P>Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, the Irish seafood industry will benefit from funding of &euro;216m.  A further &euro;118m may be made available on the basis of verified progressive change in the industry as set out in the national strategy for the seafood industry &mdash; Steering a New Course.  I believe that the most critical element in addressing the impact of high fuel prices is to make the fleet more profitable.  The planned reduction in the size of the fishing fleet, through the Whitefish decommissioning scheme launched in February, will increase the profitability of the vessels that continue to fish because they will be permitted to land higher quantities of quota stocks.  Funding under the NDP will also focus on increasing returns to fishermen through maximising the value of seafood at every stage from the sea to the table.</P>
        <P>I also consider that considerable research activity is required in order to identify the most fuel efficient equipment and practices and I will be pushing strongly for this area to be prioritised under the EU&rsquo;s Seventh Framework Programme for Research (2007&ndash;2013).  At present, Bord Iascaigh Mhara is making grant aid available to improve fuel efficiency on board fishing vessels.  I will keep this scheme under review to ensure that it covers best practice in the context of available research in the area.</P>

	<P>I am very concerned with the level of farm safety on our farms. Last year 11 people died on Irish farms.  While this was a decline of almost 40% on 2006, it is still unacceptably high. This year to-date 6 people have died on Irish farms. I strongly support the work of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), which is the national body in Ireland with responsibility for securing health and safety at work.</P>
        <P>The Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee to the HSA was set up in 2002. This Committee is made up of representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Teagasc, HSA and other farming groups and supports and co-ordinates the majority of research and promotional activities in relation to farm safety. This Committee put a Farm Safety Plan in place in 2003. The outcome of this Farm Safety Plan, which ran for 5 years, was a 28% reduction in farm fatalities, 31% reduction in farm accidents and a reduction in child fatalities from 6 per annum to 2 per annum. A new Farm Safety Plan is now being developed by the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee. My Department will fully support this new 5 year Plan with the aim of reducing farm fatalities and injuries even further.</P>
        <P>Teagasc and the HSA launched a joint initiative in 2005 to reduce the number of farm accidents on Irish farms. This three-year initiative aimed to ensure that farmers with three or less employees completed and implemented a Farm Risk Assessment and involved a series of half-day health and safety training courses. During 2006 and 2007, up to 6,500 farmers attended these farm health and safety half-day training courses and up to 400 Teagasc advisors received farm health and safety briefings. Teagasc aim to provide health and safety training to approximately 8,000 farmers in 2008. As this is the last year of the initiative, Teagasc and the Health and Safety Authority are in discussions regarding renewal of the initiative.</P>
        <P>My Department in conjunction with the Department for Labour Affairs circulated some 160,000 copies of A Code of Practice for the Prevention of Accidents and Occupational Ill Health in Agriculture in November/December 2006. Analysis of the 2007 Teagasc National Farm Survey shows that 42.5% of farmers have completed the Risk Assessment Document.  The All Island Farm Safety Conference, to be held on the 18th June in Monaghan, is being organised by the HSA and the Health and Safety Executive Northern Ireland. It will focus on safety issues on farms such as the elderly, livestock and occupational health issues in farming.</P>

	<P>Farmers can choose to have payments made to them by cheque or electronic funds transfer directly into their bank account during the remainder of the 2008 EU financial year which ends on 15 October. However, as and from the 2009 EU financial year which commences on 16th October 2008, payment by cheque will no longer be permitted under EU rules on the financing and management of the Common Agricultural Policy. From that date, my Department is required to make payments under EU funded or co-funded schemes directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. As the designated paying agency for EU funds, my Department is obliged to implement this new requirement.</P>
        <P>My Department has notified farmers of the new requirement on a number of occasions over the past year and did so again recently. A very large number of farmers have now &lsquo;signed up&rsquo; for electronic funds transfer. Farmers who have not yet done so still have a number of months <Col N="820"/>in which either to open a bank account or to notify my Department of the details of existing bank accounts. I will be urging all farmers to make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible so as to avoid disruption to their payments.</P>
        <P>My officials have briefed the banks on the new requirement and have also met with An Post/Postbank which has recently launched a new current account which will facilitate the electronic transfer of funds and which can be opened and operated through the post office network. My Department will also arrange payments to accounts in any Credit Union which has the facility to process electronic transfers. I will explore all possible options to facilitate the transition to payments by electronic funds transfer and farmers may, of course, contact my Department with any concerns that they may have.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to leases and licences for Offshore Windfarms under the Foreshore Act 1933 is as follows:</P>
        <P el="5">A. <Miles com="ix" />There are currently three valid Foreshore licences for site investigation.</P>
        <P el="5">B. <Miles com="ix" />There are seven Foreshore licence applications for site investigation currently being processed.</P>
        <P el="5">C. <Miles com="ix" />Two Foreshore leases have been granted:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(i) <Miles com="ix" />In January 2002 a lease was granted to Sure Partners Ltd for the construction of a 200 turbine wind farm on the Arklow Banks. The maximum allowable height for the turbines in this project are 100m tip to sea level, each turbine will have a capacity of 2.5MW.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="is0p2" />(ii) <Miles com="ix" />In November 2005, a lease was granted to Codling Wind Park Ltd for the construction of 220 wind turbines on the Codling Bank. The maximum allowable height for the turbines in this project are 100m tip to sea level, each turbine will have a capacity of 5MW.</P>
        <P el="5">D. <Miles com="ix" />There are three lease applications currently being considered.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(i) <Miles com="ix" />In January 2002  Kish Offshore Wind Ltd applied for a lease for the construction of a 75 turbine windfarm on the Kish Bank. The height of the turbines applied for in this project are 160m tip to sea level, each turbine will have a capacity of 2.3MW.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="is0p2" />(ii) <Miles com="ix" />In January 2002 Bray Offshore Wind Ltd applied for a lease for the construction of a 70 turbine windfarm on the Bray Bank. The height of the turbines applied for in this project are 160m tip to sea level, each turbine will have a capacity of 2.3MW.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(iii) <Miles com="ix" />In February 2007  Oriel Windfarm Ltd applied for a lease for the construction of a 55 turbine wind farm off Dundalk Bay, The height of the turbines applied for in this project are 166m tip to sea level, each turbine will have a capacity of 6MW.</P><Col N="821"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In relation to the above information it is important to note that the authorisation of offshore energy projects under the Foreshore Act is dealt with in two distinct phases. Under phase one, an application must be made for a foreshore licence for a defined area of the seabed in which to explore the viability and environmental sustainability of the development. The licensing stage does not require the developer to provide specific details of the turbines.  The public consultation for a Foreshore Licence for an Offshore Electricity Generating Station lasts one month. The commencement of the public consultation process is advertised in national and regional newspapers and also generally placed on the Department&rsquo;s web site.</P>
        <P>Where the site for which a licence has been granted proves suitable, an application may be made for a foreshore lease (phase two).  The lease application process evaluates the project and its impacts in detail using specialist advisors, statutory and non-statutory consultees, and is followed by extensive public consultation.  The current public consultation process for a Foreshore lease for an Offshore Electricity Generating Station lasts two months. Recent applications have seen over one hundred and twenty organisations consulted. The commencement of the public consultation is advertised in national and regional newspapers and also generally placed on the Department&rsquo;s web site.</P>
        <P>The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 for all energy developments (including oil, gas, wave, wind and tidal energy) on the foreshore would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.</P>

	<P>The Sheep Industry Development Strategy Group, under the chairmanship of Mr. John Malone, set out a blueprint for the sector&rsquo;s future development. Its recommendations relate to all elements of the industry and do not have a fixed timeframe.  My Department and the state agencies under my aegis are dealing with the areas relevant to them. Under REPS 4, a new mixed grazing measure specially targeted at sheep farmers has been introduced and development of this measure is being kept under review to ensure a good take up.</P>
        <P>Plans for the upgrading of a Sheep Breeding Programme are well advanced and I hope that agreement can be reached and a new programme put in place for the 2008/2009 breeding year.  Farmer confidence in the pricing system operated by plants will be improved if mechanical grading can be introduced. My Department has organised trials on this aspect and is assessing the initial results. It is also essential that producers and processors agree on the structures necessary to reward quality and to bring transparency to the pricing system.  Teagasc are making a very positive contribution as well and have developed a comprehensive plan to restructure their sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which includes hill and lowland areas.  This approach will provide an opportunity for developing a dialogue with sheep farmers about the application of the latest management practices to their enterprises and identify research and development needs.</P>
        <P>The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme was established in 2007. Bord Bia is also playing a prominent part. Almost 6,000 farms have been registered to date and over 4,200 farm audits <Col N="822"/>have been carried out. In 2007 the Department made available &euro;0.4m to support inspections under the scheme and this funding will be repeated again in 2008 and 2009.  In addition to the measures being taken at producer and processor level, promotional efforts are being undertaken by An Bord Bia which will continue to organize strategic marketing campaigns marketing in selected European markets. The downward trend in lamb consumption in certain markets presents a real challenge. To address this, Bord Bia is collaborating with its French and British counterparts on a 3 year generic lamb promotion on the very important French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.</P>
        <P>The overall goal is to facilitate the development of a more profitable sheep-meat sector in Ireland covering the lamb production, lamb processing and marketing sectors of the industry. I recognise the challenges ahead but am confident about the future of the sector provided all stakeholders play their part in undertaking the various initiatives set out in the Strategy Group&rsquo;s report.</P>

	<P>The Commission has proposed a Thematic Strategy for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.  The Strategy includes a number of initiatives to reduce the impact of sprays.  The Commission has proposed a framework Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides.  The aim of this proposal is to reduce the risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment.  The current Commission proposal does not contain any plan to &ldquo;reduce the use of crop sprays&rdquo;, except in &ldquo;sensitive areas&rdquo;, where restrictions on use will be subjected to a risk assessment.  Since my Department already carries out such risk assessments during the authorisation process for pesticides, it is anticipated that there will be no additional implications for Irish farming.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>In relation to quota allocations, the position is that Ireland&rsquo;s shares of the main fish stocks were set in the early 1980s when fish stocks were being shared out between Member States. The share allocations were based on catch records and reflected the fishing levels by the Irish fleet at that time.  The percentage shares held by each Member State have generally remained the same for over 20 years under the principle of relative stability.</P>
        <P>Since then it has been a priority of successive Government Ministers with responsibility for the fisheries brief to try to have these shares improved.   The Common Fisheries Policy was reviewed in 1992 and again in 2002 and in both cases substantial efforts were made to push Ireland&rsquo;s case for increased shares of important stocks but without success.  Ireland received no support from other Member States for changes in the allocation keys for the share out of stocks. The next overall review of the basic framework of the Common Fisheries Policy is not scheduled until 2012.</P><Col N="823"/>
        <P>The practical reality is that to achieve an increase in Ireland&rsquo;s share of catches, other Member States would have to take a cut in their shares.  This is all the more difficult to achieve when the total allowable catches (TACs) of all the main commercial species are falling and the reality is that achieving support for such an outcome at the December Agriculture and Fisheries Council, where quotas are fixed for the following year, is not deliverable. At this point the European Commission and other Member States largely take the view that the quota shares are fixed and not subject to ad-hoc changes pending any more fundamental review of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The reform package, agreed in December 2002, included key national priorities such as</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the continuation of the Hague quota preferences, which are very important to Ireland as they guarantee minimum quotas to Ireland in certain stocks,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />an action plan to address the problem of juvenile fish catches,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />stronger control and enforcement and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of Regional Advisory Councils giving fishermen a strong voice in shaping future fisheries policy at EU level.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Following protracted negotiations at the December Agriculture and Fisheries Council, 2007 a total package of 182,699 tonnes of fish was secured for the Irish Fishing Industry for 2008. This was a significant success given the initial proposal by the European Commission which involved cuts of up to 25% for 25 of the 37 stocks of importance to Ireland.  The crucial Hague preferences were also successfully defended after a number of Member States attempted to have them set aside. It appears that this system is likely to be challenged again this year and I want to re-iterate today that I will strongly resist any proposals to reduce or abolish our entitlements under these measures.</P>
        <P>The Cawley Report &ldquo;Steering A New Course &mdash; Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007-2013&rdquo; sets out a clear strategy to maximise the value of quotas focused on increasing the value of seafood at every stage from the net to the fork.  I am satisfied that the effective implementation of this Strategy, which the Government has endorsed, will deliver a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry that will maximise its long term contribution to coastal communities.  I am fully committed to working efficiently and effectively with the industry to deliver this strategy.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.  The particular issue referred to here where a primary product can enter Ireland and be processed in some way thereby allowing it to be branded, as an Irish product is known as &ldquo;substantial transformation&rdquo;.

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Climate change has potentially serious implications not just for agriculture but for all sectors of the economy.  The Irish agricultural pasture-based production system has many advantages in terms of sustainability and in a decoupled environment, efficiency of production is pursued which means that carbon emissions per unit of production are kept as low as possible.</P>
        <P>In the context of carbon proofing, the agriculture sector will continue to effect production efficiencies in order that the emissions per unit of food produced are as low as possible.  In this regard it can be expected that in 2008 the continued implementation of the Nitrates Regulations will result in better utilization of nutrients, with a consequent reduction in nitrogen applications.  Other measures which will contribute to greenhouse gas abatement, such as the encouragement of minimum tillage, the use of clover swards and the adoption of low emission trailing shoe <Col N="825"/>technology for slurry spreading have been introduced under the new Rural Environment Protection Scheme.</P>
        <P>Forestry sequestration of carbon is a significant element in the National Climate Change Strategy and will play a very important role in meeting our Kyoto targets. Both forest products and energy crops also contribute to the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by acting as substitutes for fossil fuels and my Department will continue to invite participation in the EU Energy Crops Scheme and the Bioenergy Scheme in 2008.  I realize that further initiatives may be needed to address the challenge of climate change, which is why my Department has committed substantial funding, under the Research Stimulus Fund, to various research projects devoted to identifying sustainable greenhouse gas reduction measures.  A comprehensive analysis of research needs has been carried out by my Department and will be used to inform future calls for research in the area of climate change. Furthermore, my officials are currently working closely with Teagasc and COFORD in carrying out a review of the potential mitigation options available to the sector.</P>

	<P>Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world today. The focus in Ireland is on mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and there is ongoing analysis of the potential impacts of climate change, especially in relation to agriculture.  The available information from regional climate models indicates that there will be impacts on the Irish climate. However, these are European-scale or world-scale models and give indicative information only for Ireland. The indications are that both summers and winters will be warmer, which would improve growing conditions for many crops in Ireland, especially fruit and vegetable crops.</P>
        <P>We cannot be as certain at this stage about how rainfall will be affected by climate change. Ongoing work to refine regional climate models will give a clearer picture of the likely impacts on Irish climate and will provide better information on parameters that are important to farmers and the agricultural industry. In addition, Teagasc monitors crops for changes that may be induced by changing climate, such as changing patterns of pests or crop diseases. There is however, no justification for the suggestion that Ireland is facing food shortages caused by climate change.</P>
        <P>At global level, there is increasing awareness that food security cannot be taken for granted in a world where demand is rising rapidly and is expected to double over the next fifty years.  The projected increase in world population over the next 20 years presents a major challenge to the world and the agricultural industry to feed this growing number of people.  Ireland has an important role to play in meeting this demand, as a supplier of food that is produced in a sustainable manner.  The objective must be that all production from agricultural sources is sustainable and in this context it is important that policy at EU level in terms of curbing greenhouse gas emissions does not, by default, cause production to relocate to less sustainable systems outside the EU.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120, 133, 135 and 138 together.</P>
        <P>A revised negotiating text on agriculture was issued yesterday evening and a text on non-agricultural market access earlier today.  These texts are being issued with a  view to facilitating a final WTO agreement by the end of 2008.  It is by no means clear whether such an agreement will be reached this year.  The range of issues outstanding across the broad spectrum of the negotiations and the US political situation are among the factors that make it uncertain whether an agreement can be secured in the coming period.  Already there is slippage in the negotiating timetable.  A Ministerial meeting, anticipated to take place on 19 May, has been deferred and the latest indications are that it will not now take place until the end of June or even early July.</P>
        <P>Against this background, there is no doubt that these WTO negotiations represent a significant challenge for EU and Irish agriculture. I and my Government colleagues are seeking a balanced and fair outcome across all of the various pillars of the negotiations.  I am very concerned about some of the proposals being made in the agriculture negotiations and with the lack of balance in the overall process.  It is not acceptable that the current negotiations are focused on agriculture while other negotiating areas are not making progress.</P>
        <P>The Irish Government has and will continue to take every opportunity to express our concerns in the strongest terms in the various EU and WTO meetings dealing with these negotiations.  I recently met my French counterpart in Dublin, and the current state of play and imbalance in these WTO negotiations were high on the agenda of this meeting.  I can report that France and Ireland share the same concerns on the direction of these negotiations and <Col N="827"/>will continue to insist that the Commission does not accept a deal which undermines EU agricultural production.</P>
        <P>The Commission, including Commissioner Mandelson and his officials, are well aware of Ireland&rsquo;s views on the matter.  These views have been articulated clearly and consistently at all available forums over the last several years, including bilateral meetings, meetings of the Article 133 Committee, the Agriculture Council and the General Affairs Council.  My colleague and predecessor, the T&aacute;naiste, met the Commissioner on 29 April last and set out in no uncertain terms the concerns of the Irish Government in regard to the current situation.  As the negotiations progress I will continue to impress on the Commission that Ireland will not accept an unbalanced agreement which does not provide real benefits to Ireland and the EU.</P>
        <P>At yesterday&rsquo;s Agriculture Council of Ministers meeting I met the Agriculture Commissioner, Mrs. Fischer Boel and I reiterated and highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s concerns to the Commission and to other Member States, insisting that any WTO agreement must not place a disproportionate burden on EU and Irish agriculture.  I will also continue to ensure that Ireland plays a leading role in the Group of 14+ like-minded Member States who have come together to express concerns in relation to the direction of the WTO agriculture negotiations.  I will continue to work closely with like-minded Ministers in other Member States to seek support for my position.  I am travelling to Slovenia next week where I will have bilateral discussions on the WTO with my colleagues in this group.  At official level, my Department, and other Departments involved, have and will continue to work assiduously in the various technical meetings to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s interests are best protected.  In summary, I will continue to pursue an outcome which does not undermine the 2003 reforms of the CAP and ensures that Irish and EU agriculture can compete on world markets.</P>
        <P>As to the question of sensitive product status for the beef sector, the detailed negotiations regarding the treatment of sensitive products are not yet finalised.  Under the proposals currently on the table, designation of beef as a sensitive product would reduce the proposed tariff cut of between 66 and 73% by two-thirds to a figure of approximately 23%.  In turn, the EU would be expected to open an additional import quota for beef of some 290,000 tonnes.  Although final decisions surrounding the designation of products as sensitive will not be taken until the final details of the treatment of such products is known, there is no doubt in my mind that the intention is that beef will feature among the products declared sensitive by the EU.</P>
        <P>A major concern, even with sensitive product status, is that imports would be concentrated on the high value &ldquo;steak&rdquo; cuts.  We have emphasised the nature of this specific problem repeatedly to the Commission over the course of the negotiations.  Overall, I continue to seek an outcome which will provide the maximum possible protection to the beef sector.</P>

	<P>Coillte Teoranta was established from 1 January 1989 and the annual total planting, both afforestation and reforestation, by the company since then is set out in the table.  The majority of the afforestation undertaken in recent years has been on behalf of private growers. In 1999 Coillte became ineligible for payment of the afforestation premium due to a decision by the European Commission, which was subsequently upheld by the European Court of Justice.   In the last number of years the bulk of Coillte planting has therefore been reforestation.  Coillte has also indicated that all of the land in its ownership, which is suitable for planting, has been planted.  </P>

	<P>My Department accords a high priority to maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s high status in relation to animal health and welfare in the context of protecting consumers and in view of the economic and social importance of agriculture to the country. It remains essential that we anticipate future possibilities wherever possible and maintain the capability of dealing effectively with any threats in this area, from wherever they emerge.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive approach to these threats involves the following measures:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />continued operation of schemes to reduce and eventually eradicate diseases of significant importance such as TB and Brucellosis;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />an intensive programme of measures to eradicate BSE; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />measures to deal with threats from or actual outbreaks of other diseases.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The disease programmes operated by my Department include comprehensive compensation measures to compensate farmers for losses arising from the removal of animals as a result of disclosure of disease.</P>
        <P>The animal traceability system and the Animal Health Computer System are essential elements in supporting the Department&rsquo;s policies in relation to animal health and welfare activities and consumer confidence.  These systems bring the benefits of modern technology also to the administration of the Department&rsquo;s various programmes, including the management of the TB and Brucellosis eradication schemes. The Animal Health Computer System has been extended also to facilitate the creation of a national database of all registered keepers of domestic poultry and captive birds as part of the Department&rsquo;s response to the threat of an outbreak of Avian Influenza.  There is a long history of co-operation between the administrations North and South on animal health issues.  The administrations have traditionally shared information at local and national levels on disease control and surveillance issues.  The importance of agriculture on the island of Ireland and the potential threats posed by diseases require that both Governments are involved at the highest level in protecting and enhancing the animal health and welfare status of livestock.</P>
        <P>The North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) provides a framework for the development of an all-island animal health policy.  The main objectives of the NSMC are to foster co-operation and to devise a common, unified animal health strategy for the island as a whole.  This involves the co-ordination of animal health policies and the development of joint strategies for dealing with animal diseases.  Since 2001 the structured arrangements have been very valuable particularly in our dealings in relation to outbreaks of FMD, Bluetongue and Avian Influenza in England. In addition progress has been made in relation to policies on animal identification and on a variety of animal diseases including T.B, Brucellosis, BSE and Scrapie.</P>
        <P>I welcome the continued co-operation at all levels on the activities included in the All-Island Animal Health and Welfare Strategy, most recently discussed at the North/South Ministerial Council Agriculture Sectoral meeting held in the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise, Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh on 30 April last. Progress has been noted in a number of areas, including in the areas of common contingency plans for diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease and Bluetongue, joint data sharing, identification of sheep, the development of common approaches to sheep genotyping and to Salmonella.  In addition there has been progress relating to Aujeszky&rsquo;s Disease in pigs, and the hygiene package in respect of the transmission of food chain information with animals going to slaughter and of the feasibility and priority of an all island approach relating to Trichinella in pigs.  There are also plans for consul<Col N="830"/>tation and a future cross-border event with key agriculture stakeholders from both jurisdictions to discuss the all-island strategic approach.</P>

        <P el="5">A. <Miles com="ix" />There are currently three valid Foreshore licences for site investigation.</P>
        <P el="5">B. <Miles com="ix" />There are seven Foreshore licence applications for site investigation currently being processed.</P>
        <P el="5">C. <Miles com="ix" />Two Foreshore leases for the construction of Offshore windfarms have been granted:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(i) <Miles com="ix" />In January 2002 a lease was granted to Sure Partners Ltd for the construction of a 200 turbine wind farm on the Arklow Banks. Seven turbines have been constructed to date.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="is0p2" />(ii) <Miles com="ix" />In November 2005, a lease was granted to Codling Wind Park Ltd for the construction of 220 wind turbines on the Codling Bank. No turbines have been constructed to date.</P>
        <P el="5">D. <Miles com="ix" />There are three lease applications currently being considered.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(i) <Miles com="ix" />In January 2002 Kish Offshore Wind Ltd applied for a lease for the construction of a 75 turbine windfarm on the Kish Bank.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="is0p2" />(ii) <Miles com="ix" />In January 2002 Bray Offshore Wind Ltd applied for a lease for the construction of a 70 turbine windfarm on the Bray Bank.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(iii) <Miles com="ix" />In February 2007 Oriel Windfarm Ltd applied for a lease for the construction of a 55 turbine wind farm off Dundalk Bay.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In relation to the above information it is important to note that the authorisation of offshore energy projects under the Foreshore Act is dealt with in two distinct phases. Firstly an application must be made for a foreshore licence for a defined area of the seabed in which to explore the viability and environmental sustainability of the development.  The public consultation for a Foreshore Licence for an Offshore Electricity Generating Station lasts one month. The commencement of the public consultation process is advertised in national and regional newspapers and also generally placed on the Department&rsquo;s web site.</P>
        <P>Where the site for which a licence has been granted proves suitable, an application may be made for a foreshore lease.  The lease application process evaluates the project and its impacts in detail using specialist advisors, statutory and non-statutory consultees, and is followed by extensive public consultation.  The current public consultation process for a Foreshore lease for an Offshore Electricity Generating Station lasts two months. Recent applications have seen over one hundred and twenty organisations consulted. The commencement of the public con<Col N="831"/>sultation is advertised in national and regional newspapers and also generally placed on the Department&rsquo;s web site.</P>
        <P>The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 for all energy developments (including oil, gas, wave, wind and tidal energy) on the foreshore would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 139 and 379 together.</P>
        <P>Increasing food prices and concerns regarding availability of food is a global situation, which is most severely affecting those people living in developing countries.  This complex issue has many causes, including recurrent bad weather, and changing and increasing food requirements among countries caused in particular by economic and population growth. This underlines the role of Ireland as a major food-exporting nation.  The 2003 reforms of the CAP, with the introduction of the full decoupling of direct payments under the Single Payment Scheme, allows farmers to respond to the demands of the market and effectively meet consumers&rsquo; needs.</P>
        <P>Although imports of certain commodities into the European Community may have increased, Ireland is a net exporter and is therefore not affected to the same extent as food deficit countries by global food shortages.  Bord Bia produces annual estimates for the export performance of the Irish food and drink sector and has indicated that the agri-food sector increased its level of exports by 5% in 2007 to over &euro;8.6 billion.  There was marked growth in the exports of dairy products, food ingredients, prepared foods, beverages, horticulture and cereals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has been and remains bluetongue-free and the presence of the disease in a number of other member States has not had any significant impact on Irish agriculture to date. It continues to be my objective to ensure that Ireland remains disease free and that we make every effort and take all such reasonable precautions to that end.</P><Col N="832"/>
        <P>With regard to vaccination, it is envisaged that we would vaccinate only in the event of a confirmed outbreak of the disease but that we will not vaccinate on a prophylactic basis.  A number of companies have commenced the production of vaccines for the particular strain of bluetongue that is present in the affected member states and vaccination programmes have commenced in a number of these.  It is expected that supplies will increase significantly later in the year and it is proposed to secure a store of vaccine for immediate use here in the event of a confirmed outbreak of bluetongue in and around the location of the outbreak. Further decisions on extending a vaccination programme will be taken on a risk-assessment basis, including decisions on the extent of any such programme. My Department is currently in advanced discussions with potential vaccine suppliers about arrangements for securing appropriate quantities of bluetongue vaccine under different scenarios. It is also in the process of finalising a comprehensive vaccination plan that will be discussed further with various stakeholders, including the farm organisations and the veterinary profession.</P>

	<P>The Commission has proposed a Thematic Strategy for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.  The Strategy includes a number of initiatives designed to reduce the negative impacts associated with use of chemical pesticides.  Firstly, the Commission has proposed a framework Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides, the aim of which is to reduce the risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment.  The current proposal was addressed at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council and contains provisions such as operator and advisor training, inspection of application equipment and national action plans and seeks to ensure that pesticides are used safely.  Accordingly Ireland endorsed the current text which was adopted by the Council.</P>
        <P>In addition the Commission has proposed a new Regulation concerning the placing on the market of plant protection products.  This proposal is designed to replace Council Directive 91/414/EEC (the current legislative instrument in place).  The proposal contains many novel provisions which are acceptable, including the regulation of parallel trade and simplified provisions for data protection.  However, it also includes a provision for &lsquo;hazard-based cut-off criteria&rsquo; as a mechanism for making decisions relating to the approval of fungicides, herbicides and insecticides.  If unchanged, this provision could result in a significant reduction of the number of substances available for plant protection in Europe. At yesterday`s Council meeting in Brussels Ministers failed to reach agreement on this dossier because of continuing differences between Member States on elements of the proposal. In these circumstances the Presidency undertook to &ldquo;take stock&rdquo; of the position and reflect further on the outcome of the meeting.</P>

	<P>Steering a New Course &mdash; strategy for a restructured, sustainable and profitable Irish seafood industry 2007-13, was approved by the Irish Government on 10 January 2007 and launched by the Taoiseach on 28 January as the blueprint for developing the fishing sector into the future.  The plan envisages an Irish Seafood Industry that is sustainable, profitable, competitive and market-focused, making the maximum long-term economic and social contribution to coastal communities and Ireland as a whole.  In order to ensure that the Irish seafood industry delivers on this vision, the Cawley report makes a series of recommendations which are focused on addressing critical issues impacting on the industry&rsquo;s development. These recommendations, are grouped under ten core themes. Associated with each of the development themes is a &lsquo;key priority&rsquo;, which defines the overall objective for each of the core themes. These include:</P>

	<P>The Commission submitted their observations on Ireland&rsquo;s Operational Programme (O.P) for Fisheries via a &ldquo;Negotiation Position&rdquo; document received on the 22nd of April 2008. This is a normal part of the consultative process for approval of O.P&rsquo;s.  The issues raised by the Commission were mainly procedural and/or editorial in nature.  Disappointment was expressed at the exclusion of measures under the Axis 4 pillar of the European Fisheries Fund &ldquo;sustainable development of fisheries areas&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>At a meeting between the Commission and officials of my Department on the 24 April, acknowledgement was given to our commitment for implementing these measures through state aided funds as outlined in the National Strategic Plan for Fisheries 2007-2013. Nonetheless, the Commission continued to press for its inclusion under the operational programme. The Commission also expressed concerns in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of certain EU Directives on the Environment in the context of providing EU funding under the OP for aquaculture development.  My officials are fully engaged with the Commission with a view to bringing the consultation process to a successful conclusion and getting the O.P approved as soon as possible.</P>

        <Quest>   the position regarding milk quotas for the past milk quota year; the possibility of eliminating penalties for over-production in view of imminent quota increases, the failure within the EU to fill its <Col N="835"/>milk quota and the global demand for dairy products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

	<P>The position regarding milk deliveries for the 2007/2008 milk quota year is currently being finalised, and the expectation is that the country will be over quota. In accordance with EU law, a levy will therefore be payable by over-quota producers attached to milk purchasers in whose areas quota was exceeded.  Although any levies arising in respect of the 2007/2008 milk quota year will incorporate reallocations made to take account of non-delivery of milk by some producers, once calculated they cannot be eliminated. In this regard the decision earlier this year by the Council of Ministers to increase EU milk quotas by 2 per cent applies only from 1 April 2008, and so does not provide an opportunity to eliminate levy liability in respect of the 2007/2008 milk quota year.  The filling of milk quota at EU level and the global demand for dairy products are central to the Health Check of the 2003 CAP reform as it affects the dairy sector. The Government&rsquo;s position is that, with milk quotas due to be abolished in 2015, an ambitious annual quota expansion is necessary in the interim in order to facilitate a &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo; for producers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 149 together.</P>
        <P>A number of schemes and reliefs have been introduced in recent years to bring about improvements in farm structures and the age profile of the sector. In 2005, 8% of farmers were under the age of 35 and they farmed a similar proportion of farmland. The Irish age structure is in line with the EU average.  To maintain this structure, there are a number of generous schemes and reliefs aimed at encouraging the early transfer of farms to young farmers and reducing the tax burden of such transfers on farmers. In particular, the Rural Development Plan 2007-2013 includes a range of enhanced measures to improve the structure and competitiveness of Irish farming. The new Rural Development Plan 2007-2013 contains a generous Installation Grant Aid for young farmers of &euro;15,000 (an increase of 55% of the previous grant). The early retirement pension also increased to a maximum &euro;15,000 per annum for farmers who dispose of their land by gift, sale or lease.</P><Col N="837"/>
        <P>Other incentives for early farm transfer include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />100% stamp duty relief for on transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young trained farmers;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />100% stock relief for up to four years for young trained farmers;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />90% agricultural relief from capital acquisitions tax;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Higher grant rates for young trained farmers under the farm improvement scheme;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Capital Gains Tax &mdash; Retirement relief on farm disposals up to the value of &euro;750,000 and marginal relief on disposals above this threshold.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Also the Finance Act 2007 included a number of provisions to facilitate greater levels of land mobility and farm consolidation. The measures include a third rental income exemption threshold &mdash;  &euro;20,000 for leases of 10 years or over; stamp duty relief for farm consolidation where only one farmer is consolidating his holding; and a provision whereby farmers who are leasing out land can still, subject to certain conditions, qualify for Capital Gains Tax retirement relief.  All these measures help to improve land mobility through early farm transfer or by encouraging greater levels of leasing, land swaps or farm consolidation.</P>

	<P>The most recent figures available from the Central Statistics Office are for the year 2005 and these show that there were 73,500 farmers whose sole occupation was farming or 56% of the total. The number of farmers with another either major or subsidiary occupation was 58,900 or 44% of the total and they would be considered to be part-time.  The trend in recent years has been towards part-time farming and reflects a combination of factors including the increased availability of off-farm employment. Many small-scale producers find that combining farming with off-farm employment is an effective way to ensure their continued viability in farming. At the same time, full-time farmers are looking to the new flexibility offered to them under decoupling to develop and intensify their commercial farm enterprises.</P>

	<P>The draft Operational Programme (O.P) for Fisheries for Ireland, submitted to the Commission envisages the use of EU funds under the European Fisheries Fund to support decommissioning of fishing vessels, <Col N="838"/>aquaculture development and environmental/inshore fisheries support, specifically a  small number of Co-Financed measures under the pillars of axis 1, 2 and 3.  As part of the normal consultative process for approval, the Commission adopts a negotiating position where it sets out how the OP should be improved and completed to meet the Commission&rsquo;s quality requirement for the programme. This negotiating position was received on the 22nd of April 2008.  Officials from my Department met the Commission (DG Mare, DG Regio and DG Environment) on 24 April as part of the formal process in the consideration of Ireland&rsquo;s Fisheries Operational Programme 2007-2013.   The observations of the commission on the content of the operational programme will be fully considered.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that, as outlined in the National Strategic Plan for the Fisheries Sector (2007-2013), measures under Axis 4 are planned as Non-Co Financed (ie State aided). These predominantly socio-economic sustainability measures will be implemented by BIM with the assistance of local development networks such as Leader. I am fully committed to the introduction these measures, the benefit of which will be of great import to Coastal Communities.  BIM have the primary responsibility for the implementation of the measures and are consulting with LEADER with a view to putting in place the best possible delivery mechanisms to ensure that the coastal communities dependent on fishing are given the best support.</P>

	<P>The EU Council of Ministers has set the obligatory set aside rate at zero for sowings for the 2008 harvest and this is expected to lead to a significant increase in EU grain production this year.  Production of cereals in Ireland has averaged about 2 million tonnes in recent years, with fluctuations in production being mainly attributable to weather conditions.  The increased cereals prices in the past year, together with the warm dry weather last autumn, encouraged a major increase in the sowing of winter cereals for the 2008 harvest in Ireland. Initial estimates suggest the total area sown to winter cereals is expected to increase by around 20% overall. Estimates of spring sowings will not be available until later in the year. </P>
        <P>To support grain growers, my Department continues to operate a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency, quality and viability of cereal production. These services include seed certification, seed testing, recommended lists of varieties etc. In addition, Teagasc provides comprehensive research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereal producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world.</P>

	<P>&euro;79 million was provided under the 2006 partnership agreement, Towards 2016, for the operation of the Farm Improvement Scheme. 12,675 applications were received by my Department under the Scheme prior to its suspension for new applications on 31 October 2007. These applications are currently being processed up to the level of funding available. To date, 6,017 approvals have issued to farmers to commence work under the Farm improvement Scheme.  The remaining applications are currently being processed up to the level of funding available.  The deadline of end-2008 for completion of works under the revised Farm Waste Management Scheme introduced by my Department in March 2006 does not apply to the Farm Improvement Scheme.   Under the latter Scheme, farmers normally have a period of two years from the date of approval to complete the investment works concerned. </P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department does not have figures relating to the amount of energy produced as a result of this crop production.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR) has overall responsibility for energy policy and is the lead Department for the promotion and development of renewable energy, including bioenergy.</P>
        <P>My Department has participated on a number of interdepartmental committees led by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s bioenergy resources.  For example, my Department was represented on the Bioenergy Strategy Group, which was established to consider policy options and support mechanisms to encourage greater use of biomass for bioenergy. The Group published a report &lsquo;Bioenergy in Ireland&rsquo; which made a number of recommendations to promote the bioenergy sector in Ireland.  In 2006, the then Minister participated in a Ministerial Taskforce, which agreed a National Bioenergy Action Plan to increase deployment of Ireland&rsquo;s bioenergy resources to 2020. In accordance with this plan, the Minister subsequently launched a range of measures to stimulate <Col N="840"/>production of energy crops and to complement measures introduced by other Ministers, notably the Mineral Oil Taxation Relief Scheme.</P>
        <P>The specific agricultural measures included a new National Energy Crop Premium of &euro;80 per hectare to supplement the EU premium available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme. A new Bioenergy Scheme was also launched providing establishment grants of up to &euro;1,450 per hectare to farmers interested in planting willow and miscanthus. The second phase of the Scheme was announced in December 2007 and sufficient funding has been provided to support the planting of a further 1,600 hectares in 2008. Areas planted with energy crops can also qualify for the Single Payment.  Other measures introduced included the Wood Biomass Harvesting Machinery Scheme to support developing enterprises in the wood chip supply sector and grant aid for anaerobic digestion projects under the Scheme of Investment Aid for Demonstration On Farm Waste Processing Facilities.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is funding research projects that relate directly to biofuels and energy crops through the Department&rsquo;s Research Stimulus Fund Programme. Under the 2005 and 2006 calls for proposals, five projects received grant assistance of &euro;1.5 million. The allocation under the 2007 Call for Proposals was significantly increased providing for the award of some &euro;5.3 million over the next four years to a further seven research projects. The research covers a broad range of agri-energy topics including energy crop production.</P>

	<P>At yesterday&rsquo;s Agriculture Council we had a general debate on the agricultural market situation and the evolution of agricultural and food prices.  In the course of the debate, I made the point that Europe has to consider the role of its own agri-food sector, so that it can play its part in ensuring a high standard of quality food for future generations.  I said it was more important than ever that we ensure that we retain a strong agricultural production base in Europe.  We needed to recognise this in considering issues such as WTO and the shape of our future Common Agricultural Policy.  My comments were echoed by a number of other Ministers.</P><Col N="841"/>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s debate in the Council illustrated the increased focus of EU Ministers on the issue of food self-sufficiency.  I believe that this increased focus will gather momentum in the forthcoming discussions on the CAP Health check and in the debates on the future of the CAP post 2013.  I will participate actively in these discussions. I will be arguing for the need to build a better and stronger CAP, adapted to contemporary needs and more effective in supporting our farmers and food industries.  I have already spoken on this matter to my French counterpart, Michel Barnier at our meeting in Dublin a week ago.  We both agreed on the necessity for the CAP to continue to support sustainable agriculture, in line with the European model of agriculture, thereby ensuring stable food supplies to European consumers.</P>

	<P>The position is that the cross-compliance regime has been in place since the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme in 2005.  Cross-compliance involves two key elements:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A requirement for farmers to comply with 18 statutory management requirements (SMRs) set down in EU legislation on the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A requirement to maintain the farm in good agricultural and environmental condition.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Cross Compliance obligations were phased in over a three-year period.  Eight cross-compliance SMRs came into force in 2005 together with the Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition requirements.  A further 7 SMRs governing food, animal and plant health came on stream from 1 January 2006. The final 3 SMRs governing Animal Welfare were introduced with effect from 1 January 2007.</P>
        <P>A Commission report on the application of cross-compliance was presented to the April 2007 Agriculture Council and Council conclusions were adopted in June 2007.   The following issues were covered in the conclusions:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Tolerance for minor non-compliance</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Introduction of a &ldquo;de minimis&rdquo; rule for penalties</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Harmonisation of control rates</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Advance notice of Inspections</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Reviewing the &ldquo;10 month land availability rule&rdquo;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Making better use of the results of existing controls in the context of risk analysis for cross-compliance</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Phasing in of cross-compliance for new Member States.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">Council and Commission Regulations are now in place implementing the new arrangements with effect from 1 January 2008.</P>
        <P>Under the new regime, while all inspections should generally be unannounced, a  Member State  can give up to 14 days notice for land eligibility inspections and for cross-compliance <Col N="842"/>inspections involving SMRs other than those related to animal identification and registration, food, feed, and animal welfare. For checks involving animal identification and registration the maximum advance notice is 48 hours provided that the purpose of the inspection is not jeopardised.   For SMRs dealing with feed, food and animal welfare no advance notice may be given.</P>
        <P>My Department is required to ensure that the control environment established under cross-compliance is robust and meets with regulatory and audit requirements. Nevertheless, my Department believed that the cross-compliance provisions were overly complex for farmers and has sought and gained appropriate simplification in the context of the review of cross-compliance conducted by the Commission and the Regulations introduced as a result.  It is intended however, that further simplification of the cross-compliance arrangements will be pursued in the context of the CAP Health Check.</P>

	<P>The Common Agriculture Policy provides the EU with various market measures with which it manages the dairy market.  During 2007 dairy prices increased dramatically as a consequence of high demand and tightness of supply on EU and World Markets.  This shortage of supply caused the Commission to zero rate export refunds for milk products.  Prices have fallen back from their high point of last autumn but still remain strong and above intervention levels.  Increased EU production in recent months has seen large quantities of butter go into private storage, which indicates an expectation of strong demand in the second half of the year.  My Department closely monitors developments in the dairy market on an ongoing basis.  I will continue to recommend that the Commission utilise the various market measures, including export refunds, when the market conditions warrant them.</P>

	<P>The draft Operational Programme (O.P) for Fisheries for Ireland, submitted to the Commission envisages the use of EU funds under the European Fisheries Fund to support decommissioning of fishing vessels, aquaculture development and environmental/ inshore fisheries support, specifically a  small number of Co-Financed measures under the pillars of axis 1, 2 and 3. There was no provision in the O.P submitted, for measures under axis 4.</P>
        <P>However, as outlined in the National Strategic Plan for the Fisheries Sector (2007-2013), measures under Axis 4 are planned as Non-Co Financed (ie State aided).

I am fully committed to the introduction these <Col N="843"/>measures, the benefit of which will be of great import to Coastal Communities.  BIM have the primary responsibility for the implementation of the measures and are consulting with LEADER with a view to putting in place the best possible delivery mechanisms to ensure that the coastal communities dependent on fishing are given the best support.</P>

	<P>Climate change has potentially serious implications not just for agriculture but for all sectors of the economy.  The Irish agricultural pasture-based production system has many advantages in terms of sustainability and in a decoupled environment, efficiency of production is pursued which means that carbon emissions per unit of production are kept as low as possible.  In the context of carbon proofing, the agriculture sector will continue to effect production efficiencies in order that the emissions per unit of food produced are as low as possible.  In this regard it can be expected that in 2008 the continued implementation of the Nitrates Regulations will result in better utilization of nutrients, with a consequent reduction in nitrogen applications.  Other measures which will contribute to greenhouse gas abatement, such as the encouragement of minimum tillage, the use of clover swards and the adoption of low emission trailing shoe technology for slurry spreading have been introduced under the new Rural Environment Protection Scheme.</P>
        <P>Forestry sequestration of carbon is a significant element in the National Climate Change Strategy and will play a very important role in meeting our Kyoto targets. Both forest products and energy crops also contribute to the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by acting as substitutes for fossil fuels and my Department will continue to invite participation in the EU Energy Crops Scheme and the Bioenergy Scheme in 2008.  I realize that further initiatives may be needed to address the challenge of climate change, which is why my Department has committed substantial funding, under the Research Stimulus Fund, to various research projects devoted to identifying sustainable greenhouse gas reduction measures.  A comprehensive analysis of research needs has been carried out by my Department and will be used to inform future calls for research in the area of climate change.  Furthermore, my officials are currently working closely with Teagasc and COFORD in carrying out a review of the potential mitigation options available to the sector.</P>

	<P>The Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector in Ireland &lsquo;Growing for the Future,&rsquo; sets a target for forest cover of 17% of the total land area to be achieved by 2035.  Over the period of the <Col N="845"/>National Development Plan, 2007 to 2013, the short-term objective is to grow annual planting to 10,000 hectares per annum. The average rate of planting over the last three years was 8,360.  Planting of trees, is supported by my Department through the current suite of Afforestation Grant and Premium Schemes, along with the various support measures such as road infrastructure and shaping and pruning grants. This is the most financially attractive package available in the history of forestry in Ireland.  The establishment grant covers 100% of the planting costs, while the annual forestry premium is payable to farmers for 20 years. Both the grant and premium rates have been reviewed in recent times and increased to make the scheme more attractive.</P>
        <P>Under the Forest Environment Protection Scheme (FEPS), landowners can receive a premium of up to &euro;200 per hectare, in addition to their forestry premium, should they choose to avail of the scheme, which promotes the establishment of high nature value forestry. This scheme was launched as a pilot in 2007, and after some refinements, including reducing the planting level threshold from 8ha to 5ha, has been adopted into the suite of afforestation schemes. My Department is also undertaking significant promotional activities to encourage further participation in forestry, for instance the joint national promotion campaign run with IFIC. A series of radio advertisements highlighting the benefits of planting forests were aired on local and national stations in March and April this year. These ads are supplemented by promotion and publicity in other media throughout the year.</P>
        <P>In March of this year, Mr. John Malone completed a review of the factors affecting the rate of afforestation in Ireland. In his report, he makes several recommendations aimed at furthering the afforestation programme, which are currently under review.  I am committed to boosting the forest planting levels in Ireland. I believe that with the excellent financial package available and the promotional efforts supporting the planting programme that an increase in the afforestation rate can be achieved.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide clarification regarding REP scheme payments to miscanthus growers and in particular the qualifying hectarage of miscanthus grass which will allow farmers to make best use of the Government support schemes in view of the fact that growers have sprayed and ploughed land in preparation for planting thereby placing a constraint on the need for clarification on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>REPS is an agri-environmental measure, and for that reason payments to farmers must be costed and justified on the basis of quantifiable environmental benefits that go beyond keeping land in good agricultural and environmental condition and observing the statutory management requirements of the Single Payment Scheme.  No element of the REPS payment can be justified on the basis of a production support, nor can a farmer be compensated for the same action twice.  REPS is not a support scheme; it is a voluntary scheme open to all farmers and payments under the scheme are not entitlements as of right.  Participants who agree to be bound by the scheme conditions qualify for payment.</P>
        <P>Under the specification for REPS 4, the maximum area of willow and miscanthus permitted on REPS farms is 10 hectares or 25% of the REPS contract area, whichever is the greater. This area limitation is in order to maintain landscape diversity. It would not be desirable or acceptable in an agri-environmental scheme to have whole farms, or a major portion of the lands, devoted to the growing of an introduced species monoculture.  Existing levels of flora and fauna need to be sustained, and if possible improved, on all REPS farms and the large-<Col N="846"/>scale growing of miscanthus is not consistent with this objective.  The same maximum area applies in REPS 3 and my Department has clarified the position in a circular sent directly to all REPS planners.  It has come to my Department&rsquo;s notice that a small number of farmers have exceeded the limits. My Department is examining these sympathetically on a case-by-case basis.</P>

	<P>The lack of synchronisation in the authorisation process for the marketing of GM crops employed in the US and in the EU can result in the adventitious or accidental presence of unauthorised GM events in imported animal feed because the GM event, although authorised in the US, is not yet authorised in the EU.  The Commission are conscious of the anxiety and difficulties this situation is causing in the Irish and EU feed trade. They have recently referred to the requirement to introduce appropriate tolerance levels for GM events not yet authorised in the EU but authorised in other jurisdictions and to expedite their authorisation process.  In the meantime my Department has in place a risk based sampling programme to protect the industry against the threat of adventitious presence in feed imports from non-EU approved events.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has been and remains bluetongue-free and the presence of the disease in a number of other Member States has not had any significant impact on Irish agriculture to date. It continues to be my objective to ensure that Ireland remains disease free and that we make every effort and take all such reasonable precautions to that end.</P>
        <P>My Department has carried out a number of assessments to seek to determine the risk of the possible introduction of the disease into the country. The first of these was undertaken and published in November and the analysis considered a number of possible routes of introduction of bluetongue. These ranged from the possible importation of infected ruminants and wind-borne infected vectors, which were classified as representing high risk routes of introduction, to the potential risk associated with the accidental importation of infected midges travelling on horses, in vehicles / containers or with agricultural / horticultural products such as hay, straw or plants. These latter alternative routes were classified in the risk assessment as representing a low risk route of introduction of the virus and the analysis concluded that no further control measures or mitigation procedures were required or warranted at that time.</P>
        <P>That risk assessment was by its nature based on an assessment of the disease situation and the controls in place at a particular period in time and is, therefore, subject to revision should there be a significant change in that disease situation. Due to changes in animal movement <Col N="847"/>regulations that were introduced in response to new scientific data on how the virus can be transmitted in animals and pressure from Ireland, a further risk analysis was carried out by my Department earlier this month. This risk analysis concluded that there have been no new developments since the November study in scientific knowledge on the accidental introduction of infected vectors by other means such as carriage on wind current, in vehicles, containers, on plants, on non-susceptible species (horses, pets, people) or in hay and straw. Consequently, the risk from these possible sources remains as outlined in the November assessment.  Further information on bluetongue is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.</P>
        <P>I take it that the Deputy&rsquo;s first question relates to Parliamentary Secretaries (as they then were) up to the coming into operation of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1977, which established the office of Minister of State, and to Ministers of State thereafter.  The number of Parliamentary Secretaries standing appointed on 1 January 1970, was 6 and on 1 January 1975 was 7.   The number of Ministers of State standing appointed on 1 January 1980 was 10 and on 1 January 1985, 1990 and 1995 was 15.  On 1 January 2000 and 2005 there were 17 and currently there are 20.</P>
        <P>I take it that the Deputy&rsquo;s second question refers to the practice initiated in 1994 whereby a Minister of State, in addition to the Chief Whip, normally attends meetings of the Government.  On 1 January 1995, 2000 and 2008 there was one such Minister of State while on 1 January 2005 there was none.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the facts surrounding a mine exploding on 15 May 1943 in Mullaghduff, County Donegal in which <Col N="851"/>19 people died (details supplied); and if there are plans for a commemoration by the State or if he will consider funding or contributing to such a commemoration if organised by relatives or by a community group. </Quest>

	<P Just="Left">The tragic mine explosion at Mullaghduff, Co Donegal in 1943 which resulted in the deaths of 19 people and injuries to four others was the worst of the several incidents to occur in the State during the period of the Second World War.  These civilian deaths are included among those remembered annually at the National Day of Commemoration in July in honour of those Irishmen and Irish women who died in past wars or in service with the United Nations.  I understand that a commemoration is to take place this year on the 65th anniversary through a local community initiative. I am not aware that any application has been received by Government for a contribution towards the costs arising from this commemoration.</P>

        <P>The Office of Public Works is continuing to work with Mayo County Council to reduce the risk of flooding in South Mayo.  In the case of Clyard, Thomastown and Kilmaine flood mitigation works were completed in 2007, at a cost of approximately &euro;270,000.  Efforts to find a solution to the problem in the Neale are ongoing, in conjunction with the Council.  An ecological assessment of the proposed works at Hollymount will be completed shortly.  It is expected that an application for permission to proceed with the works will be made to the National Parks and Wildlife Service during June.  Funding will be made available for flood mitigation works in Neale and Hollymount that are acceptable on environmental and economic grounds.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</P>
        <P>The income tax exemption for stallion stud fees was introduced in 1969. The exemption was subsequently extended to cover corporation tax on its introduction in 1976. The exemption itself currently applies to profits or gains arising</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to the owner, or part owner, of a stallion which is ordinarily kept on land in the State from the sale of stud services or rights to stud services within the State, or</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to the part owner of a stallion which is ordinarily kept on land outside the State from the sale of stud services or rights to stud services anywhere.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In this latter case, the part owner must be engaged in bloodstock breeding within the State and must show to the satisfaction of the Revenue inspector that the part ownership of the stallion in question is primarily for the purposes of that bloodstock breeding business.</P>
        <P>In certain circumstances, stallions which normally stand at stud in Ireland are sent abroad to the Southern Hemisphere when the breeding season has finished in Ireland. These are treated for the purposes of the exemption as being ordinarily kept on land in the State. This means that the tax exemption continues to apply but only as regards profits or gains arising from the <Col N="855"/>servicing of mares within the State.  Profits arising from the servicing of mares outside the State are not exempt.  This exemption will terminate with effect from 31 July this year, after which time the profits or gains will be fully within the charge to tax. These changes were provided for in the Finance Acts of 2006 and 2007.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to have Annex III of the EU VAT directive amended to include road safety products and thereby reduce the rate of VAT applicable on such products; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[19666/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under the VAT Directive Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  As Annex III does not include the supply of road safety products, the only rate that can apply to such products is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.</P>
        <P>In relation to amending Annex III of the VAT Directive, I would point out that this could only be done in the context of an overall review at Community level of reduced rates.  Whilst the Commission launched a debate on reduced rates in July 2007, as yet, no specific Commission proposals have been brought forward. Generally, any significant review of the application of VAT across the different EU Member States can be complex.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that in matters relating to the VAT rating of goods and services, I am constrained by the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In relation to the VAT rate that applies to defibrillators, the position is that under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  The zero VAT rate cannot therefore be applied to defibrillators which are subject to the standard rate.</P>
        <P>In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use. The reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.  Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works will consider funding Waterford City Council to undertake works to alleviate flooding of the Tramore Road if a scheme, which is technically feasible, cost beneficial and which at a minimum is not detrimental to the environment can be devised.  The scheme, which was originally proposed for the Tramore Road, was not cost beneficial, and could not therefore <Col N="856"/>be funded.  The Tramore Road passes through Kilbarry Bog, which is a National Heritage Area.

During this time work was undertaken on the development of our foster care and residential care services, including the development of special care units for children who require intensive interventions.  More recently, the policy focus has shifted to a more preventive approach to child welfare, involving support to families and individual children, aimed at avoiding the need for further more serious interventions later on.  These family support services complement the existing residential and foster care services.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;The Agenda for Children&rsquo;s Services&rdquo; has been developed and published by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2007.  The principle of having health and social services provided on the basis of the child being supported within the family, within the local <Col N="859"/>community, is at the core of &ldquo;the Agenda&rdquo;.  The purpose of the policy document is to set out the strategic direction and key goals of public policy in relation to children&rsquo;s health and social services.  &ldquo;The Agenda&rdquo; includes a list of &ldquo;Reflective Questions&rdquo; for policy makers, HSE Senior Managers and frontline staff.  This is a unique feature of &ldquo;the Agenda&rdquo;.  The aim of these questions is to assist people working in the system to check and change the way they work in the light of learning from past experience and also to allow them to better understand where their own work on behalf of children fits into the wider system.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is working with the HSE in promoting the message of &ldquo;the Agenda&rdquo; to service providers around the country.</P>
        <P>Family support services are provided to promote the welfare of children who may be at risk of abuse or neglect.  Family support may be delivered formally through the direct services of statutory and voluntary organisations, and informally through the support of extended families, friends, neighbourhoods, communities, parishes and other local networks.  Family support programmes are provided nationally by services such as the Community Mothers, Family Support Workers, Teen Parents Support Projects, Youth Advocacy Programmes and Spring Board Projects and encompass a range of general parenting programmes and supports, including parenting classes.  The HSE works closely with non-governmental organisations in the provision of these services.  HSE funding for family support initiatives has increased by 79% since 2003 (from &euro;45.7m to &euro;81.8m in 2008).  This reflects the Government&rsquo;s on-going policy of emphasising a preventive and supportive approach to child welfare, within the family setting, in line with &ldquo;the Agenda for Children&rsquo;s Services&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>In recent times, the Health Service Executive has re-oriented its addiction services to address the needs arising from changing patterns of drug use in the population e.g. evidence shows that most cocaine users are poly drug misusers and need to be treated for poly drug misuse and not solely for cocaine use.  The HSE is also involved in developing community based stand-alone stimulant intervention services which includes additional training for its staff on issues such as cocaine and it is re-engineering existing addiction services to meet emerging needs.  Evidence also indicates that many approaches already in use in general addiction services work well with cocaine users.  The commitment in the Programme for Government is being considered against this background.</P>

        <Quest> the breakdown, on a hospital and county basis, of the number of cases of MRSA that have been reported in each hospital in the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2007 and from 1 January 2008 to date in 2008; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>At a European level, the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) was established in 1999 in response to the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance in Europe.  EARSS comprises a network of over 800 microbiological laboratories serving some 1,200 hospitals in 30 countries that collects routinely generated antimicrobial susceptibility testing data on invasive infections caused by seven important bacterial pathogens.  As of January 2008, all 44 microbiology laboratories in Ireland serving 65 acute hospitals (public and private) participate in EARSS representing 100% coverage of the Irish population.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the case definition for EARSS, data are collected on the first bloodstream isolate of <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>per patient per quarter.  The table provides an extract of the relevant information as requested by the Deputy, taken from the recent report of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  The table which relates to 2007 includes the number of MRSA isolates by hospital.  Most of the variation in reported numbers of S. <i>aureus</i> bloodstream infections between hospitals can be explained by differences in hospital size, activity and patient populations.  At present there is no way to adjust the data to allow for these differences and hence direct comparisons between hospitals are not possible.</P>
        <P>There are limitations on the data provided.  The EARSS case definition does not distinguish between clinically significant and non-significant bloodstream isolates, so some isolates may be contaminants (e.g. bacteria on the patient&rsquo;s skin), rather than true bloodstream infections.  The definition only includes bacteria isolated from blood cultures, and does not include other types of infection caused by <i>Staphylococcus Aureus</i> such as wound infections, pneumonia etc.  The standardised method for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance includes the first isolate of <i>Staphylococcus Aureus</i> from each patient in each three month period.  This could mean that if a patient has more than one episode of MRSA in a three month period then only the first episode is reported and alternatively some duplicates may occur as <i>Staphylococcus Aureus</i> (either MRSA or MSSA) can be isolated from the same patient over two or more quarters.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that if a patient is diagnosed with a bloodstream infection at a given hospital it does not indicate that the infection was acquired at that hospital.  Many bloodstream infections are acquired in the community, but only diagnosed upon admission to hospital.  A patient may either have acquired the infection in one hospital, but the infection may be diagnosed on transfer to another hospital.  The frequency with which blood cultures are taken depends on the numbers and types of patients being treated at that hospital and access to laboratory services.  Hospitals that have a high frequency of taking blood cultures are more likely to diagnose bloodstream infections, but are also more likely to detect contaminated blood cultures.</P><Col N="863"/>
        <P>The report of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre which includes this data together with information on antibiotic consumption and alcohol-based hand rub usage in both 2006 and 2007 is the first of its kind and forms part of the HSE action plan to guide infection control.  While the data in the report comes with multiple caveats, it does nonetheless represent a significant step forward in terms of providing essential data that will serve as a benchmark for assessing progress in the future.  While we don&rsquo;t have information yet on 2008, it is intended that similar data will be published quarterly from now on.  I am glad to note that the trend so far is downward both in terms of the overall level of MRSA and the proportion of <i>S.</i> <i>Aureus </i>that is methicillin resistant, although the improvement is not statistically significant.  While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203, 204 and 218 together.</P>
        <P>The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) have announced a preferred bidder for the provision of laboratory testing services for the National Cervical Screening Programme. This is an important milestone which will enable the NCSS to launch the first quality assured, population based National Cervical Screening Programme for women in Ireland aged 25-60 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In keeping with EU procurement legislation, the procurement process is being conducted in an open and competitive manner.  Submissions were invited from local and international laboratories during the process. The NCSS has concluded that the preferred bidder can deliver a service that meets all of the required quality criteria. The Deputies will appreciate that quality is a critical requirement of the new programme.  The National Hospitals Office (NHO) of the HSE has a commitment to staff currently employed in cytology services, and has met with their representative.  Any decisions regarding reassignment of employees will be addressed after the National Cancer Screening Service has completed the procurement process for cytology services.</P>

        <Quest> the number of private operations by private consultants carried out in public facilities on an annual basis; the basis on which these consultants are supplied with ancillary services and assistance; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the private practice of public hospital consultants employed in public acute hospitals under the consultants&rsquo; common contract.  The provision of private care in public acute hospitals is a long standing feature of the Irish health care system.  Over 2,500 beds in public hospitals are designated as private and semi-private.  A ratio of 80:20 public/private applies on average across the entire acute system.  The percentage of beds designated as private varies between individual hospitals; for example, there is a higher ratio of private beds in maternity and paediatric hospitals and a lower ratio in other hospitals.</P>
        <P>Under the common contract, consultants are entitled to engage in private practice within the public hospital or hospitals in which they are employed.  The extent to which consultants may engage in off-site practice is determined by the category of post which they hold and is subject to them satisfying the employing authority that they are fulfilling their contractual commitment to the public hospital(s).  With regard to on-site private practice, a consultant&rsquo;s overall proportion of private to public patients should reflect the designated ratio of public to private beds.</P><Col N="866"/>
        <P>I am concerned that there are instances where the ratio of private work has far exceeded the stated bed designation.  This is a matter which is central to this Government&rsquo;s reform programme, in particular in relation to a new hospital consultants&rsquo; contract. In this context,  I should add that the new consultants&rsquo; contract, which was accepted by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association on 16 May, will facilitate the appointment of Clinical Directors who will lead and manage consultants, as well as managing clinical budgets and services for patients.  The Clinical Director will also have a pivotal role in monitoring compliance with the ratio of public to private practice, and taking corrective action where the private practice limit is exceeded.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE to arrange to provide the detailed information requested by the Deputy directly to him as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.

        <Quest> if she will undertake an immediate review as recommended by the recent OECD report which suggests that the Government take a broader look at international systems, including systems that are similar in terms of their needs, in order to examine different patterns of hospital requirements in the north east; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The OECD review of the Irish Public Service report &mdash; Ireland Towards an Integrated Public Service &mdash; includes a health sector Case Study on the reconfiguration of hospital services in the North East.  The OECD <Col N="868"/>state that the Case Study does not purport to be a full analysis or review of wider issues relating to health care in Ireland or a commentary on health service provision generally in Ireland.  The Report emphasises the need to deal with the reforms of primary and community care in tandem with the reconfiguration of hospitals if the overall vision is to be realised. In order to ensure the model is the optimum for the region, it suggests a broader examination of international systems.  This would help identify how other countries have met the needs of areas with characteristics similar to the North East.</P>
        <P>The OECD took the view that an examination could include the possibility of having two hospitals, one regional and one general, in the North East.  It added that the outcome of such an examination could equally be a reaffirmation of the plan for one acute hospital for the region.  The OECD findings will need to be carefully considered in the context of the Transformation Programme for the North East.  No decisions have been made by the Government or by the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the future location of the new hospital.</P>
        <P>The immediate focus of the Transformation Programme is to have acute and complex care moved from 5 to 2 hospital sites and to ensure that services in the region are organised to optimise patient safety.  The first step in the development of a fully integrated regional health service is to ensure that the people of the North East have local access to both routine planned care and immediate life saving emergency care.  Over the next few years, in preparation for all acute emergency in-patient care and complex planned care being provided at a regional centre, the existing five hospitals will continue to improve services by further merger of their acute care specialties.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 to 230, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the need to develop neurology and neurophysiology services additional revenue funding of &euro;3m was allocated to the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2006.  In 2007 further additional revenue funding of &euro;4m was allocated to support the continuing development of services in the area of neurosciences (neurology, neurophysiology and also neurosurgery services).  There has been an increase in the number of consultant neurology posts arising from this investment.  There are currently 24 approved posts of consultant neurologist in Ireland.  This is an increase of 10 approved posts since the 2003 Comhairle na nOspideal report on neurology and neurophysiology.  In addition, there are currently 7 approved posts of consultant clinical neurophysiologist, an increase of 4 approved posts since the Comhairle report.  The HSE has made provision in its 2008 National Service Plan to progress the recruitment of a number of unfilled consultant neurologist and consultant neurophysiologist posts.</P>
        <P>A Strategic Review of Neurology services in Ireland has been undertaken by the HSE.  The Review was overseen by a multidisciplinary Steering Group whose aim was to identify the current level of service provision and future requirements for neurology and neurophysiology services in Ireland.  The specific objectives were to:</P>
        <P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />Describe the epidemiology of neurological conditions in Ireland.</P>
       <P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />Evaluate current neurology services, including paediatrics and neurophysiology.</P>
        <P el="5">3. <Miles com="ix" />Review the evidence in relation to models of service delivery and make a recommendation on the preferred model for the Irish health system.</P>
        <P el="5">4. <Miles com="ix" />Identify requirements for the development of neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and prioritise service requirements.</P>
        <P el="5">5. <Miles com="ix" />Report to the Director of the National Hospitals Office.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Work on the review has recently been completed and the final draft report has been submitted to the Director of the National Hospitals Office for consideration.  The review builds on the previous work done in 2003 by Comhairle na nOispid&eacute;al.  The findings will help to inform the approach taken by the HSE to the future development of these services.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy on the additional issues raised.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) which replaced the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which was also administered by my Office.  I understand that the Group in question received capital funding totalling &euro;1.16 million under the EOCP and, as a result, has recently entered their new building.</P>
        <P>The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) under the NCIP was introduced by my Office in January of this year and has an allocation of &euro;154.2 million over three years.  This Scheme will continue to support community-based childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  The Group in question has been approved under the CCSS for transitional funding for the period January-June 2008 of &euro;37,375.  I understand that they received their first instalment of this grant on 22 February.</P>
        <P>Community childcare services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  In general, the parent profile of services, and the amount of subvention they will receive, are determined on the basis of completed parent declaration forms which are returned as part of the application process.  However, in the case of some specialist services, such as that operated by the Group in question, it is recognised that some additional arrangements may be necessary.  Officials from my Office have been in correspondence and discussions with the manager of the service in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform you that the service has been approved CCSS funding of &euro;107,640 for the period July to December 2008.  This level of funding is guaranteed for the start-up period of July-December 2008 and the level of funding for 2009 will be reviewed in the context of the level of service provided from September 2008.  The Childcare Directorate of my Office has notified the Group of this decision.</P>

        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that it has conducted a review of services at Roscommon County Hospital and at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe.  The review was initiated in response to concerns raised by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al about the current service configuration for surgery and anaesthetics, at Roscommon and Portiuncula, the issues faced by the two small hospitals in maintaining surgical services independently, and the need for closer co-operation between them to ensure services are sustainable in future.  The review will help to inform decisions about the most appropriate configuration of services at these hospitals in the future.  My Department has been informed by the HSE that the Executive is at present considering the outcome of this review.</P>

This includes responsibility for arrangements to ensure appropriate service delivery for General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme (medical card and GP visit card) patients.  The arrangements for the provision of publicly funded GP services, including those provided under the GMS Scheme, are under consideration.

	<P>The Government has agreed to the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) which will facilitate intersectoral collaboration on the prevention of chronic diseases.  It is intended that measures to tackle obesity and to promote good health will be advanced through the IDG.  My Department will be publishing our first National Nutrition Policy later this year.  Recommendations will focus, primarily, on the nutrition needs of the 0-18 year age group.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Department of Education and Science have been involved in developing healthy eating guidelines for schools.  Guidelines for preschools and primary schools are already developed and appropriate healthy eating training by community dieticians with <Col N="880"/>preschool and primary school staff is currently underway.  Post-primary school guidelines will be launched in the coming weeks.  Guidelines on levels of physical activity are currently being devised by the Population Health Directorate of the Health Service Executive.  The Chronic Disease Framework, which I launched on the 10th April 2008, acknowledges the burden of chronic disease and the need for an integrated approach on prevention to tackle lifestyle factors including obesity.  The Cardiovascular Health Policy Group, due to report this summer, will also be advising on measures to tackle lifestyle issues like obesity, at population level as well as in the primary care setting.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has established a Working Group to implement the recommendations of The Report of the National Taskforce on Obesity, for which it has the lead responsibility.  A sum of  &euro;3 million was allocated for this purpose in 2006.  This is in addition to the annual spend of &euro;25 million on health promotion activities, &euro;5 million of which is utilised in anti-obesity initiatives.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator K.P.M.G. and McCann Fitzgerald.  The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care including contract beds in private homes.  Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.  A patient may have occupied a contract bed in a private home but may not have paid any recoverable health charges and would therefore not be due a repayment.  The Act provides an independent appeals process whereby applicants can appeal the decision of the scheme administrator.</P>

	<P>Persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services qualify for a medical card, which entitles them to a range of health services free of charge.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>In general, eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).  The main exception is persons aged 70 and over, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card.  The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.  As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>There has been a growing demand for, and investment in, speech and language therapy services over the last number of years.  A particular priority for this Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent <Col N="883"/>years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates.  In this regard, training places for speech and language therapists have increased by 320% since 1997 (from 25 to 105).  My Department has worked closely with the HSE in the provision of clinical placements for these students; an essential component of the therapy degree programmes. </P>
        <P>There are currently four Speech and Language Therapy courses in Ireland &mdash; 3 undergraduate courses and one graduate entry course.  The undergraduate courses are in University College Cork (UCC), Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG).  The undergraduate courses are of 4 years duration leading to an honours degree.  The graduate entry course is provided in the University of Limerick (UL) and is of 2 years duration.  For entry to this course students are required to have a relevant undergraduate degree at honours level.  The number of speech and language therapists employed in the public health service has grown from 282 wholetime equivalents in 1997 to 721 wholetime equivalents at end March 2008, a 156% growth in that period.</P>
        <P>The part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the number of children who require speech and language therapy relates to the management and delivery of health and personal services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

	<P>Under Section 8 of the Roads Act 1993 the National Roads Authority (NRA) may apply to the Minster for Transport to re-designate a road to be a motorway subject to certain conditions being met.  This includes a requirement for a public consultation process.  That process is being undertaken in connection with an application by the National Roads Authority for redesignation of elements of the N6, N7, N8 and N9 as motorways.  The time limit for forwarding written submissions to the Minister expired on Friday 28th March 2008.  A number of written submissions have been received and these submissions are currently under consideration in my Department.  Once that process has been concluded, I will make a decision on whether to grant the application from the NRA. </P>

	<P>I have not yet received proposals from the Joint Committee on Transport regarding this matter.  When I do I will convey this to the group established and chaired by the Dublin City Manager, to develop a new Dublin City Centre Traffic Management Plan to address the traffic management issues which will arise from the construction of major Transport 21 projects, particularly in the city centre.  The plan will also take account of the impact of other works, including the renewal of water, gas and electricity services and a range of private developments planned for the city.  The Group includes the chief executives of the transport agencies and representatives of business organisations.  The City Council is working to ensure that the Traffic Management Plan will be in place and tested well before initial work on the various T21 investment projects commences. </P>
        <P>The objective of this plan will be to ensure continued access to the City Centre and its retail, cultural and leisure attractions.  All the agencies participating in the formulation of the plan are keenly aware of the importance of maintaining access to the centre of Dublin and of retaining and enhancing its competitive edge.  The proposals to which the Deputy has referred are, I presume, those outlined recently in the media by the Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport.  I understand that the Chairman has indicated that he intends to present this plan to me.  When I receive the plan, it is my intention to ask the Chairman to take the report into consideration in the deliberations of the group.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The question of introducing a PSO air service on the Waterford-Dublin route was first raised in 1993. I understand that the E.U. Commission refused to sanction the proposal because the route is relatively short and because Waterford was already adequately served by other transport modes.  In the interim, the relevant surface transport links have been upgraded and continue to be improved.  In the circumstances, I have no proposals to revive the question of including the airport in the Irish PSO air service programme.  However &euro;22.3 million has been allocated to Waterford airport under the regional airports capital expenditure grant scheme as part of Transport 21.  In 2007, Waterford received &euro;1.3m in operational subvention for the airport and I expect to consider a further application for subvention to the airport in the current year.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on such expenditure.  The Department commissions consultancy services only where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid (Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance programme), where ongoing independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required.  Given the overall scale of the Irish Aid Programme, I am satisfied that this level of monitoring, review and evaluation is both prudent and proportionate.</P>

        <Quest> the reason for the difficulty in issuing a passport for a person (details supplied) in County Monaghan in view of the fact that they were previously issued a passport and the current application is simply to replace the first passport which has been lost. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Passport Office can only issue a passport to an Irish Citizen.  The person in question was born in Ireland in 2005.  Under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004, persons born in the State after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside without restriction in the State or in Northern Ireland, may claim citizenship by birth in the State only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for 3 years of the 4 years preceding their birth.  In all such cases, it is the practice of the Passport Office to seek evidence, in the form of official documentation, of lawful residence in the State by one or both parents. </P>
        <P>An application for an Irish passport was first submitted on behalf of the child by his mother to the Passport Office in November, 2005.  This application was approved and a passport was issued in December, 2005.  The passport was reported lost by the applicant&rsquo;s mother and an application for a replacement passport was received on 21 February, 2008.  In line with routine procedure in respect of lost or stolen passports, it was necessary for the applicant&rsquo;s mother to re-submit original papers including evidence of citizenship.  Upon checking of these papers, it was the view &mdash; wrongly as it turned out &mdash; that satisfactory evidence of reckonable residency in the State had not been provided and that the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship had not been established.  The application was therefore rejected on 10 March, 2008.</P>
        <P>Both applications were subsequently re-examined in detail by the Passport Office.  Based on this review, the Passport Office is satisfied that the applicant is a citizen and therefore entitled to an Irish passport.  A replacement passport was issued on 16 May 2008.  The Passport Office has also been in contact with the applicant&rsquo;s mother to apologise for the error and for the inconvenience.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  For the period 2000 to 2006 IDA Ireland had set itself a high-level performance target for the Objective 1 (BMW) Area, which committed the Agency to work to deliver a target of 50% of all new Greenfield jobs to be located in the Objective 1 Area.  Despite difficult global trading conditions, substantial progress was achieved against this target and in that period 36% of all new Greenfield jobs were located in the area. At the end of 2007, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 26,430 people employed in IDA supported companies in the BMW Region, which represents almost 20% of all IDA supported employment in the country.</P>
        <P>The knowledge intensive FDI for which Ireland now competes favours locations in or near centres of urban scale, where it has access to the concentrations of infrastructure, skills and <Col N="894"/>services it needs.  Accordingly, IDA Ireland has aligned its regional strategy with the National Spatial Strategy and is focused on delivering investments to the Gateway and Hub locations.  In this regard the target now for IDA Ireland is to locate 60% of new investments outside of the Greater Dublin Area.  The strategy in place to achieve this involves matching investor requirements with the competencies, infrastructure and critical mass of the Gateway and Hub location.  The key sectors of focus for IDA are Life Sciences, Information and Communications Technologies and high value Services activities.  In this connection, it must be remembered that, under the revised EU Regional Aid Guidelines, the BMW and South East Regions are the only areas where regional aid is available up to 2013.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the work of the Agency on the ground, together with the continued roll out of the National Development Plan will continue to bear fruit in terms of investment and job creation for the people of the BMW Region.</P>

	<P>I would advise the Deputy that I have no direct responsibility in relation to property transactions or in relation to the level of conveyancing costs attending to such transactions.  In so far as the Consumer Protection Act 2007 is concerned, the Act, whilst not dealing with issues such as the cost of specific products or services, does contain provisions applicable to all sectors which prohibit traders from engaging in unfair commercial practices including misleading actions, misleading omissions and aggressive commercial practices.</P>
        <P>In that regard, any consumer who believes that they have suffered as a result of being misled in relation to the price of a good or service, including in relation to a property conveyancing service, may wish to contact the National Consumer Agency which is the body responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007. The Deputy will be aware that the Agency is independent in the exercise of its statutory functions.</P>

	<P>The Statutory Instrument 130 of 2008 deferred the introduction of the requirement for employers to provide training to employees in respect to specific tasks listed in Schedule 4 of Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006 (S. I. No. 504 of 2006). The tasks involved are:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(i) <Miles com="ix" />mobile tower scaffold (where the employee has not been trained in basic or advanced scaffolding),</P>

        <P el="5" FLI="0">The reason for the deferral was that, due to problems in the accessing of certified training courses, it was not practicable for the required numbers of employees to obtain the required competence levels to obtain the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) card as described in the 2006 regulations.  It should be noted, however, that the recent statutory instrument did not defer the introduction of the requirement for competence and CSCS recognition for other tasks listed in the 2006 Construction Regulations.  These tasks are:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p2" />(i) <Miles com="ix" />self erecting tower crane operation &mdash; where the employee has not been trained in tower crane operation</P>

	<P>Under the aegis of my Department F&Aacute;S labour market services for disabled people have been mainstreamed, in line with best practice internationally. This means that the objective is the systematic integration of disabled people into the open labour market by actively creating conditions whereby disabled people can compete and operate in the labour market on an equitable basis with their non-disabled peers.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has been making considerable efforts to encourage disabled jobseekers, regardless of their educational or working background, to register with F&Aacute;S Employment Services. In particular, F&Aacute;S supports GET AHEAD which is an organisation that assists disabled third level students or graduates seeking employment to find work appropriate to their qualifications.  This organisation operates a work placement initiative in partnership with large companies.  Graduates with disabilities who are finding it difficult to get employment are encouraged by F&Aacute;S to <Col N="896"/>familiarise themselves with the service provided by GET AHEAD. They may be contacted at AHEAD, Anglesea House, 63 Carysfort Ave, Blackrock, Co Dublin, telephone number 01- 2789325.</P>
        <P>A job seeker with a disability should initially call to the local F&Aacute;S Office and discuss his or her options with an Employment Services Officer (ESO). The ESO is the access point to all F&Aacute;S training and employment services. F&Aacute;S staff have considerable experience in assisting unemployed people, including those with disabilities and across a wide range of backgrounds, on the options to assist people access labour market opportunities, or return to employment.  All vacancies advertised by F&Aacute;S are open to disabled people, as indeed are all F&Aacute;S training courses and employment programmes.  F&Aacute;S has in place a series of employer supports that are specifically for the employment of disabled people.  Full details of these supports are available from the F&Aacute;S Employment Service Offices or on the disability portal of the F&Aacute;S website at www.fas.ie.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I should point out that the figures for 2006, 2007 and 2008 refer to consultancies as defined by the revised 2006 Guidelines issued by the Department of Finance.  Figures for the earlier years predate these revised guidelines and represent total expenditure by my Department on consultancies, contractors and external service providers &mdash; categories which we had previously grouped together as &ldquo;consultancies&rdquo; when replying to previous Parliamentary Questions on this topic.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) were set up in 1993 to provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.</P>
        <P>The Boards are widely dispersed geographically and provide a single point of contact at local level for new and established small businesses.  All areas of the country are served by and benefit from, the full range of Enterprise Board grant supports and entrepreneurial development programmes.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria enterprises may access assistance and support from the CEBs.  The forms of financial assistance which are available, subject to certain restrictions, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study Grants.  The <Col N="898"/>provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice such as Programmes covering Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education, and Women in Business networks.</P>
        <P>The cost of administering the CEB network is primarily made up of payroll costs and associated expenditure &mdash; travel costs, office accommodation, etc.  Typically, each CEB would have between 4 and 5 staff.  The total number of staff employed by the CEBs nationally is about 150, a figure that has been broadly constant for several years. The focus of CEB activity has been increasingly on the provision of &ldquo;soft&rdquo; supports &mdash; management training, mentoring, advisory and information services, etc.  A significant allocation is made to the CEBs each year for the provision of these soft support or Measure 2 activities.  These activities are considerably more labour intensive than processing grant applications.  While the direct costs of training, mentoring, etc are borne by the programme budget (&euro;11.2 million in 2007), a very significant portion of CEB staff time is taken up with the organisation and delivery of such activities.  In addition, CEB staff would be engaged on a daily basis in the provision of an informal information and advisory service to local entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2008 the Capital allocation for the 35 CEBs stands at over &euro;20m.  This will enable the Boards to continue to be actively involved in the area of economic development and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.  This will be done not just by direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters but also through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation.  The precise statistical information sought by the Deputy is in tabular format as follows.  Figures in relation to grant approvals and project approvals are collated on an annual basis at year-end.  Accordingly 2008 figures are not yet available for these activities.</P>

	<P>The Social Partnership Agreement &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo;, provides for greater co-ordination between organisations concerned with employment rights compliance, with a view to realising the considerable potential for synergy that exists in this area.  In particular, the agreement provides that authorised officers of the new National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) will join with officers of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in Joint Investigation Units.  The role of these Joint Investigation Units is to address areas where evidence suggests that non-compliance with employment rights legislation exists.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2007, which came into operation on 30th March, 2007, provides for the disclosure of relevant employment data between the Office of the Revenue <Col N="902"/>Commissioners, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment/NERA. This legislation effectively enables NERA to join with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to work together in Joint Investigation Units.  Since the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2007, exchange of information activity has already taken place between the bodies in a number of specific cases. In addition Joint Investigation activity, involving the three bodies, has also taken place, particularly in the context of the NERA Construction Industry Campaign in May-July 2007.</P>
        <P>A Working Group has been established comprising the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and NERA to further enhance procedures for improved cross-Departmental co-operation and the sharing of information by the respective Departments/Offices and to plan future Joint Investigation activities and strategies.</P>

	<P>The Employment Permits Section of my Department informs me that following the introduction of new administrative arrangements in 2007 under the Employment Permits Act, 2006, employment permits are now issued on the basis of different permit types with dedicated staff working in each group. This system has streamlined the work of the section allowing faster times for issuing. Currently, fully completed applications for all employment permit types are processed within our business target of 15 working days.</P>

        <Quest> if, with regard to electrical contractors and the fact that a private company (details supplied) is calling on contractors and requesting to see their books and records, including payroll, she will confirm the way statutory authority would be given to a limited company to force employers to hand over their books and records in order that they carry out an inspection to see if the employees are in the pension scheme operated by the construction workers pension scheme and then report the matter to the Labour Court; if she had a role in promoting the CWPS to business people when they were setting up in business, in view of the fact that it has come to this Deputy&rsquo;s attention that the Technical Engineering Union has suggested in correspondence that the details of this pension scheme are readily available through the Labour Court and her Department; if she is satisfied that when the Labour Court passes a complaint to the labour inspectorate of her Department as a result of an inspection carried out by the company which is a limited company with no statutory powers, that she should recommend prosecution; and if she is further satisfied that section 27(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Industrial Relations Act 1946, has been fully met by the Labour Court and that all sides to the employment agreement between the Electrical Contracting Association and the Technical and Engineering Union, meet the criteria of substantially representing the majority of the employers and unions in the industry, particularly when this agreement was set up on 24 September 1990, and as at the latest review dated 11 May 2007. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The company to which the Deputy refers (EPACE) was established under the aegis of the National Joint Industrial Council for the Electrical Contracting Industry. While its main <Col N="903"/>objective is to advise Electrical Contractors of their responsibilities under the Registered Employment Agreement (REA) for the Electrical Industry it also carries out inspections of Electrical Contractors in order to ensure compliance with the agreement. While the organisation does not have statutory authority under employment rights legislation to undertake such inspections, Electrical Contractors have in the past been in general willing to facilitate, and cooperate with, these arrangements.</P>
        <P>Section 45 of the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 is intended to support and enhance monitoring and inspection activity in relation to compliance with the Registered Employment Agreement in the electrical contracting industry. The Bill awaits consideration by D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  In the meantime current arrangements continue to apply. Regarding the question of initiating prosecutions on the basis of an inspection undertaken by EPACE, the Deputy should be aware that enforcement of the provisions of the Registered Employment Agreement for the Electrical Sector is effected through the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts.</P>
        <P>A trade union, an association of employers or an individual employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with the Agreement. As EPACE does not have a statutory basis for taking a complaint to the Labour Court, complaints to the Court in respect of non-compliance with the Registered Agreement are in the normal course made by the Technical and Electrical Engineering Union (TEEU). If, after investigating a complaint, the Labour Court is satisfied that the employer is in breach of the Agreement, it may by order direct compliance with the Agreement.</P>
        <P>NERA&rsquo;s Inspection Services receive requests, from time to time, from the Labour Court to undertake an inspection of an employer&rsquo;s records for the purposes of securing certain employee details. Such information is then used by the Labour Court in calculating the amount of pension or other arrears due to employees in the context of a complaint made by the TEEU. In such cases, therefore, the Labour Court is the relevant redress authority and I, as Minister, do not have any function insofar as making a determination or initiating a prosecution is concerned.  Failure to comply with an order of the Labour Court is an offence punishable by a fine. In accordance with section 7 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 the Minister may bring proceedings in relation to such offences. Insofar as non-compliance with Labour Court orders directing compliance with the Registered Employment Agreement for the Electrical Sector is concerned, the practice is for the TEEU to request the Department to initiate legal proceedings against the relevant employer.</P>
        <P>As regards the specific query about Section 27.3(c) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, I repeat that the Labour Court is a separate statutory body, which acts independently of the Minister in the carrying out of its functions.  I have no function in relation to the decision making process of the Court.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 296 and 297 together.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>In the period January 2007 to date, there have been 3 site visits to Mayo, 2 in 2007 to both Westport and Castlebar and one in 2008 to Westport.  To date none of these visits has resulted in the establishment of an industry in County Mayo.  Discussions with existing or prospective client companies are an operational matter for the Agency and are treated as confidential.  While IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of location, the final decision on location is taken in all cases by the promoting company.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development. The National Spatial Strategy provides a framework for achievement of this goal through the prioritization of development and investment in the gateway and hub locations. On this basis, IDA Ireland seeks to attract Foreign Direct Investment into the gateways and hubs, as well as a small number of additional locations, throughout the West, and particularly in Mayo through the linked hubs of Ballina and Castlebar, and Westport. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s sectorial emphasis in Co Mayo is on attracting new knowledge intensive projects in the Medical Technologies, Life Sciences, Information Communications Technology and International Services sectors.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Agency works with its existing base of overseas companies in County Mayo to encourage them to grow and expand.  A notable success of this strategy was the announcement, in November 2007, by Baxter International Inc, a world leading healthcare company, in November 2007, that it intended, with IDA support, to invest more than &euro;75 million over a six <Col N="905"/>year period as part of a strategic programme to introduce new technologies and higher value products to its manufacturing plants in Castlebar and Swinford, Co. Mayo.  This investment will establish a development and innovation capability, enhance therapies for the treatment of patients with renal failure, introduce new generation manufacturing processes, up-grade existing manufacturing facilities and advanced drug delivery and packaging systems and provide for extensive re-skilling of the existing workforce.</P>

	<P>The management of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s industrial property portfolio including the purchase of land and the creation of business parks, are day-to-day operational matters for the agency and not matters in which I have a function.  I have been informed by IDA Ireland that it owns a total of 63.21 hectares of land in County Mayo, of which 14.82 hectares are unused and currently being marketed.  The tabular statement sets out the location of the individual properties.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Agency own two buildings in County Mayo, a 335 m<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> cluster unit in Ballina and a 540 m<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> factory unit in Charlestown. The unit in Ballina is occupied at present while the Agency&rsquo;s Property Marketing Department is currently involved in sale negotiations on the unit in Charlestown.  IDA Ireland also holds a 35 year lease on a 2,603 m<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> Factory in Ballina which the Agency has sublet since 1992 to an Enterprise Ireland company.</P>

	<P>I understand the requirements that the Deputy is referring to is the provision of toilet and changing/shower facilities.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (No. 10 of 2005) applies to employers and employees in all employments, including those in the <Col N="906"/>security industry. Section 8 of the Act requires that every employer ensures, so far as is reasonably practicable the safety, health and welfare at work of all of his or her employees. The general duties of the employer as set out in Section 8 includes the provision of adequate welfare facilities.</P>
<?oasys _cl14- ?>
        <P>The provision of sanitary and washing facilities and changing rooms and lockers are provided for in Regulations 20 and 21 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 299 of 2007). A guide to the appropriate numbers of conveniences to be provided can be found in Chapter 1 of Part 2 Workplace of the Guide to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 published by the Health and Safety Authority.  The provisions set out in this legislation and guidance document are generally applicable to all places of employment and would therefore apply in this case also.</P>

	<P>The amount of funding available for spending on sport in 2008 is &euro;336 million which demonstrates a clear and substantial commitment to investment in sport by this Government.   In 2008 my Department has allocated &euro;57.631 million to the Irish Sports Council, an increase since the last Olympic year of &euro;26.9 million, or 87%. One of the ISC&rsquo;s primary functions is to encourage the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence in competitive sport.  In this regard the ISC works in partnership with the Irish Institute of Sport, the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Paralympic Council of Ireland and the relevant governing bodies of sport in the preparation of Irish athletes for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.  Significant progress has been made to date by all the agencies in preparation for the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games.</P>
        <P>The Olympic and Paralympic Councils of Ireland are the agencies responsible for the organisation and participation of the Irish teams at the Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The Irish Sports Council provides annual funding to both Councils for administration and programme costs aimed specifically at preparation for the Games.  The OCI and PCI have responsibility for a number of areas including:</P>
        <P><Miles com="is0p8" />(i) <Miles com="ix" />team selection (following nominations from governing bodies of athletes that have reached qualification standards);</P>
        <P><Miles com="is0p6" />(ii) <Miles com="ix" />selection of support personnel;</P>

        <P><Miles com="is0p2" />(vii) <Miles com="ix" />all logistics at Games time and</P>
        <P>(viii) <Miles com="ix" />liaison with the organising committee and the International Olympic Committee.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">Primary responsibility for the preparation and performance of individual athletes rests with the relevant National Governing Body or, in the case of Paralympic sports, the Paralympic Council of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Planning has been comprehensive and well funded, with plans implemented by top quality professionals at every step.  The ISC has defined success as meeting its target of six finalists at the Olympics.  This target is still in place and I hope it will be achieved. In February 2008, the ISC announced the allocation of &euro;9 million in High Performance Support.  15 focus sports received over &euro;5.9 million for their high performance plans, athletes and teams received over &euro;2.2 million under the International Carding Scheme and the Institute of Irish Sport received &euro;935,000.  This brought the total to &euro;30.06 million invested in this Olympic and Paralympic cycle.</P>

	<P>The current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme provides grant aid to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools.  The current round of the Programme closed to applicants on 31 July 2000 and the expenditure under the Programme since that time has focused on the 57 projects which make up the existing Programme. &euro;184m has been provided in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 for supporting existing projects in the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme and for new projects to be selected following the launch of a new round of the Programme.</P>
        <P>The terms and conditions of a new round will be devised taking into account the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review report on the existing Programme which has been completed by my Department and which will be published shortly.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government recognises that the response to the issue of obesity must address the various complex causes, including diet, lifestyle and environmental factors.  As part of this response, I am aware that investment in sport can yield very tangible returns in improved fitness and health for individuals, which can help combat obesity and result in a consequent reduction in the demand on health services. The Irish Sports Council (ISC) has a statutory role in developing sport and increasing participation in Sport in Ireland.  My Department funds the ISC on an annual basis and has allocated over &euro;57 million to the ISC in 2008.  This significant level of funding ensures that the ISC can continue to embark on initiatives and programmes that increase participation in sport and physical recreation by people of all ages in the country.</P>
        <P>The Irish Sports Council&rsquo;s current strategy, &ldquo;Building Sport for Life&rdquo; 2006 &mdash; 2008, identifies increasing participation in sport as a key objective and, based on its research programme with the Economic and Social Research Institute, sets specific targets in this regard.  To implement its plans for increasing participation, the ISC is ensuring the national roll out of the Local Sports Partnership (LSP) network in order to deliver greater access to sport for all.  It is working with National Governing Bodies of Sport to deliver large-scale participation programmes and it is targeting sections of the community that have traditionally low levels of participation in sport and physical activity, such as older people, women and people from areas of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Children and young people are also specific target groups and there are several ISC programmes and initiatives aimed specifically at young people.  These include the Bunt&uacute;s series of programmes for primary schools and pre-schools, which operate through the LSP network; the Youth Field Sports initiatives to support the work of the GAA, FAI and the IRFU in expanding their participation base, with a particular emphasis on young people in areas of low participation; and various programmes specifically targeting young people organised under the Women in Sport scheme or operating within the LSP network.  Some of the LSP projects have been supported in partnership with the Health Services Executive, thus recognising the need to challenge the issue of obesity through a multi-disciplined, cross-functional approach.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the availability of sporting facilities is crucial to the greater involvement of people in sporting activities.  In that context, the Government has invested significantly in the provision of such facilities through the Sports Capital and Local Authority Swimming Pool programmes.  Under the Sports Capital Programme, allocations to the value of &euro;85 million were awarded to 935 projects nationwide in 2007 and allocations for 2008 will be announced after the 2008 applications have been assessed.  Under the Pool Programme, eight new swimming pools were opened in 2007 and a further three pools have been opened so far in 2008. I will continue to monitor progress in this area closely and I am confident that the programmes provided by the Irish Sports Council to increase participation, together with the continued Government investment in sports facilities, will contribute significantly to combating the problem of obesity in this country.</P>

	<P>CSO statistics for overseas tourism for 2007 show a very positive result in terms of overseas numbers &mdash; up 3.9% to an all time high of over 8 million visitors &mdash; and revenue earnings &mdash; up almost 4.5% to &euro;4.9 billion. As global competition intensifies and consumer preferences evolve, these results represent a very robust performance by the sector and confirm how dynamic and responsive the Irish tourism sector is.  Performance to date in 2008 is so far positive. The CSO figures for the first two months of the year show over 900,000 visitors to Ireland for the period &mdash; an increase of almost 1% over 2007, which was a record year for Irish tourism.  Financial instability, deteriorating exchange rates and weaker economic growth, have become features in some of our key source markets in recent times and would suggest that 2008, despite performance to date, will prove to be a very challenging year.</P>
        <P>The home holiday market is an increasingly important component of the tourism business in Ireland particularly in terms of seasonal and regional spread. Statistics on the regional spread of tourism in 2007 will not be available until later this week but in 2006 (the latest figures available) over eighty-three per cent of holiday trips and eighty-eight per cent of holiday nights by domestic tourists were spent outside the Dublin area. This offsets, to some extent, the relative strength of Dublin in the overseas visitors market.  In 2006, expenditure on domestic tourism across all regions (excluding Dublin) grew by 17% &mdash; with some regions performing better than others. Preliminary estimates for 2007 indicate that domestic expenditure has grown by a very positive 23%.</P>
        <P>While the regions outside of Dublin earn almost 70% of all Tourism revenue (based on 2006 figures) the fact that all regions and sectors are not benefiting to the same extent from our tourism success continues to be a matter for attention from the Department and the State tourism agencies as tourism policy and programmes evolve.  I am confident that the new regional tourism development boards and the strategies that they have prepared will facilitate the tourism industry to maximise its contribution to the regions to a greater extent than at present, and that the various region specific initiatives managed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland Ltd will further help to address this situation.</P>

Each sector of the Department has a unique contribution to make to the enrichment of our society, and as a consequence the quality of life of the people of Ireland. The Revised Estimates Volume, copies of which are available in the D&aacute;il Library, sets out the details of expenditure planned by the Department for 2008 in each of the sectoral areas of Arts and Culture, Sport and Tourism. Total expenditure will amount to &euro;725 million <Col N="914"/>this year including programme expenditure of &euro;170 million on Tourism Services, &euro;336 million on Sport and Recreation Services and &euro;208 million on Arts and Culture.</P>
        <P>In addition the National Development Plan, 2007 &mdash; 13, which was published in January, 2007 contains the largest ever Government investment programme for the development of the arts and culture, tourism and sport sectors.  The NDP includes an &euro;800m Tourism Development Programme, a &euro;904m Cultural Sub-Programme and a &euro;991m Sport Sub-Programme. These programmes contain a wide range of capital schemes and projects which will be progressively rolled out over the lifetime of the Plan. The Government is committed to implementing the NDP and I look forward to advancing the full range of projects envisaged during my tenure as Minister.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE). SWA provides a safety net against poverty in that it gives a statutory entitlement to a minimum weekly income, based on criteria set out in legislation. The Midland Area of the Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned was in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance but this payment was suspended on the grounds that he was working. The Community Welfare Officer has now <Col N="916"/>reviewed the case and payment of supplementary welfare allowance has recommenced from 16 May 2008. </P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The HSE has advised that the person concerned is residing in the family home. Consequently, she has accommodation available to her and is not entitled to rent supplement in respect of alternative accommodation. She has been advised accordingly and has appealed against this decision to the HSE Appeals Office.  She will be advised of the outcome of her appeal in due course. </P>

	<P>The outgoings of a household are not taken into account in the means assessment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  The assessment is based on income.  All the income of the customer and his/her spouse/partner is taken into account. However certain disregards apply.  For example, the first &euro;20,000 of any savings or investments is disregarded.  If the customer or his/her spouse/partner is working in insurable employment, PRSI, Union Subscriptions, Personal Retirement Savings Accounts and Additional Voluntary Contributions are disregarded.  There is a further daily disregard of &euro;20 for each day worked up to a maximum of &euro;60 a week and the balance is assessed at 60%.</P>
        <P>Where the person has a mortgage on the property in which he/she resides, the mortgage repayment is not taken into account.   The value of this property is not assessed for means purposes. Where a person owns a second property, any outstanding mortgage on this property is disregarded from the capital value of the property and the balance is assessable. In the case of self-employed customers and farmers all reasonable business expenses are disregarded in the means assessment.  There are no disregards for mortgage repayments on the family home or loans.   However, supports are available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances where they experience difficulties with mortgage payments or other household bills.</P>

This is an increase of almost 70% on the figure for May 2007 (929) which is significantly higher than the national increase of approximately 27% over the same period.  The Portlaoise office is currently staffed by five staff and the Branch Manager is satisfied that this number is adequate to meet local demand.  The branch manager has spent some &euro;60,000 recently in upgrading the office to improve the physical environment and introduced a range of measures to improve customer service.  In addition, staff in Kilkenny local office are working overtime to deal with the increased volume of claims from Portlaoise.</P>
        <P>My Department recently commissioned a customer service survey of all local and branch offices in the South East Region, which includes Portlaoise.

        <P>The purpose of the Scheme of Community Support for Older People is to encourage and assist the community&rsquo;s support for older people. This Scheme is open to people aged 65 and over who have a genuine need for assistance. Any local voluntary or community based organisation, especially those working with or providing support for older people, can apply to my Department for funding under the Scheme. Individual applications must be made through such organisations. My Department can provide assistance in identifying a local community and voluntary groups in different geographical locations</P>
        <P>The Scheme provides maximum individual grants of &euro;300 in respect of the once-off installation cost of socially monitored alarms. Funding is also available under the Scheme for a range of other security measures for older people. I should point out that the Scheme does not cover conventional intruder alarms.  Full information in respect of this Scheme is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.pobail.ie.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation, published in May 2007, made a series of recommendations for the development of a comprehensive rehabilitation pillar under the National Drugs Strategy.  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to implement these recommendations.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will be working to ensure that the recommendations of the Report are implemented.  Indeed, I understand that Minister of State, Pat Carey T.D., met with the Minister for Health &amp; Children, Mary Harney T.D., twice this year to pursue this matter.  In this context, the Deputy should note that the HSE is taking the lead role on rehabilitation and I understand that the post of Senior Rehabilitation Co-ordinator is to be advertised shortly and that it will be filled by September.  It is also proposed that the National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee, the establishment of which was recommended in the Report, will be in place for September to dovetail with the appointment of the Senior Rehabilitation Co-ordinator, who will chair it.</P>
        <P>Overall progress on the implementation of the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation is also monitored through the Inter-departmental Group on Drugs (IDG).  The following are among the recommendations on rehabilitation that are being progressed:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />steps are being taken to increase the numbers on drug-specific Community Employment Schemes from 1,000 to 1,300;</P><Col N="922"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Dept Education &amp; Science is developing proposals for an Education Fund for drugs rehabilitation;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Dept Environment, Heritage &amp; Local Government is establishing a Working Group to progress the recommendations in regard to accommodation issues for drug misusers;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Irish Prison Service is working to improve the operation of the Local Prisons Liaison Groups and to ensure a continuum of care for problem drug users when they leave prison; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />various research options are being considered. In addition, my Department has provided increased funding to the Family Support Network that will help to support the role of families in the rehabilitation process.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Furthermore, it should be noted that additional funding of &euro;12.5m was secured for the drugs area of my Department in 2008 and part of this is being used for rehabilitation initiatives.  In particular, funding of &euro;0.75m is being provided to support the development of rehabilitation initiatives through the Drugs Task Forces, building on the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation.   These initiatives will assist drug users to regain the capacity for daily life from the impact of their drug use.  Overall, I am confident that progress will be made on the implementation of the recommendations of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation in the short-term and I look forward to the benefits that this will bring to recovering drug users.</P>

	<P>The process of developing a new National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009&ndash;2016 has commenced in my Department.  In this context, a Steering Group has been established with representatives from the key statutory, community and voluntary interests involved in tackling problem drug use.  The work of the Group is ongoing and an extensive consultation process is currently underway. I look forward to the development of a new Strategy that will further strengthen our overall response to the evolving drugs problem. With this in mind, the Deputy will appreciate that I would not like to pre-empt the outcome of this process.</P>
        <P>With regard to the current strategy, the South Eastern Regional Drugs Task Force, which includes Tipperary South, has been allocated approximately &euro;1.6m this year.  An alcohol and substance misuse campaign to highlight and promote positive extra curricular activities specifically aimed at young people to distract them away from alcohol and substance misuse into healthier pursuits has been funded.  An outreach worker is also funded to provide support, mentoring and outreach services to young people in South Tipperary who are at risk of substance misuse or engaged in substance misuse and who are excluded for these reasons.  Funding has also been provided to Aiseir&iacute; Addiction Treatment Centre which provides residential treatment.</P>

        <Quest> if, regarding renegotiations for blue whiting in EU waters, there are plans in place to renegotiate Irish fishing rights within the framework of the Lisbon treaty, with particular emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity within the EU Lisbon treaty, which expects regions within Europe to harness economic and social potential; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s share of the Community&rsquo;s fishing opportunities was established for the main stocks  in the early 1980s when these opportunities were being portioned out between Member States.  The share allocations were based on catch records and reflect the fishing levels by the Irish fleet at that time.  The percentage shares held by each Member State have generally remained the same for over 20 years under the Common Fisheries Policy&rsquo;s principle of &ldquo;relative stability&rdquo;.  In addition, at each December Fisheries Council, Ireland has received an additional share of some of the most important stocks around our coast under the &ldquo;Hague Preferences&rdquo; based on the 1976 Hague Agreement which recognised the development needs of peripheral regions whose populations were heavily dependent on fishing activity. </P>
        <P>Since then, it has been a priority of successive Government Ministers with responsibility for the fisheries brief to try to have these shares improved.  The Common Fisheries Policy was reviewed in 1992 and again in 2002, and in both cases substantial efforts were made to push Ireland&rsquo;s case for increased shares of important stocks but without success.  Ireland received no support from other Member States for changes in the allocation keys for the share out of stocks.  The next overall review of the basic framework of the Common Fisheries Policy is not scheduled until 2012.</P>
        <P>The discussions regarding sharing out blue whiting quota in EU waters is a different matter.  Blue whiting is a highly migratory species in the North-East Atlantic which is to be found in European Community waters only part of the year. The stock is managed under arrangements between the European Community, Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland.  These arrangements are negotiated on an annual basis and involve setting a total allowable catch (TAC), based on scientific advice and catch records of the parties, as part of a series of coastal states agreements for the year.  Once agreed, the 2008 blue whiting TAC total is shared out amongst the parties concerned according to agreed allocation keys, with the European Community&rsquo;s share similarly distributed among Member States.</P><Col N="929"/>
        <P>I am committed to working closely with the Irish fishing industry to deliver the best possible deal, taking account of the scientific advice on fish stocks and the needs of fishing communities around the coast, at the annual  TAC and Quota negotiations near the end of the year.</P>

	<P>Within the European Community, fishing activities are carried out under the Common Fisheries Policy.  Under this Policy, the annual Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas for fish stocks are agreed each year during negotiations at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in December.  The TACs and quotas are based on advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES).  ICES recommends TACs for the various fisheries based on its analysis of the sus<Col N="930"/>tainability of the stocks involved.  The European Commission then brings forward a TAC and Quota proposal for the coming year which takes into consideration the scientific advice as well as the Commission&rsquo;s consultations with all the stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s proposal is considered by the Council of Fisheries Ministers in December, and a revised proposal is agreed.  Member States&rsquo; quotas are determined by the allocation keys that are fixed for each fishery.  These guarantee the Member States fixed shares of the various TACs.  Ireland and the United Kingdom are also able to invoke the so-called &ldquo;Hague Preferences&rdquo; in respect of certain important fish stocks during the negotiations.  The Hague Preferences gives Ireland an additional share of certain TACs in these fisheries.  Each Member State is responsible for managing its fishing quotas and ensuring that catches by its fishermen do not exceed the limits agreed at the December Council.  In Ireland, representatives from the industry, the Department and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority meet once a month to agree the catch limits for whitefish and deep-sea species for the following month.  Meetings are also held as required to discuss pelagic management arrangements.  The proposals of industry representatives for the management of fish stocks are, as far as possible, implemented.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 357 and 358 together.</P>
        <P>Changes in food prices are primarily a function of market forces operating at international, EU and national level.  Consistently strong economic growth in developing countries is the main driver of changing world food demand towards high-value agricultural products and processed foods.  Slow-growing supply, low stocks, and supply shocks at a time of increasing demand for feed, food and fuel have led to price increases globally.  In common with the rest of the EU, Ireland has been affected, both positively and negatively, by higher food prices.</P>
        <P>Data on the recent rise in food and non-alcoholic beverage prices must be viewed in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s position regarding overall food expenditure, where the proportion of household income spent on food is among the lowest in the EU.  In common with countries such as the UK, Germany and Luxembourg, Ireland would spend a significantly lower proportion of total household expenditure on food when compared to other EU countries, with the most recent estimates putting Ireland at approximately half the EU 27 average for expenditure on food.  I am aware of the possible impact of higher food prices on the less well off; therefore this Government will continue to focus on the need to keep in place sound economic and social policies to protect the more vulnerable sections of society.</P>

	<P>The Seafood Strategy &mdash; Steering a New Course 2007 sets down a vision for a sustainable profitable and self-reliant industry.  The Strategy clearly recognises that the vision must revolve around developing a strong and positive identity for Irish seafood on the domestic market and in key international export markets.  The development of such an identity will assist in positioning Irish seafood products at the upper end of the industry&rsquo;s targeted market.</P>
        <P>BIM have been involved in progressing the Strategy&rsquo;s vision in terms of developing quality product schemes and encouraging industry wide participation and cooperation in promotional and marketing initiatives.  Significant progress has been achieved with four of the main fishing cooperatives coming together under a single brand name.  The April Brussels Seafood Show provided an opportunity for these cooperatives to meet buyers from key international markets and the initial feedback from the buyers was extremely encouraging.  It is anticipated that other such developments will follow.</P>

	<P>The escalation of fuel costs, as a result of global economic and political conditions, remains a matter of concern for all sectors of industry.  It is important to note that the fishing industry in Ireland already receives favourable treatment in the form of a full rebate on excise and VAT on marine fuel, if the enterprise concerned is registered for VAT.  In addition Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) is making grant aid available to improve fuel efficiency on board fishing vessels.  Fuel subsidies, in terms of operating aid for fishing vessels, are not permitted under EU State Aid rules and any such measures introduced by EU Member States would be in breach of EU law and subject to Infringement proceedings in the European Court of Justice. </P>
        <P>Within the EU State Aid rules and the funding available to each, it is a matter for each Member State to put in place measures to support and develop the fishing industry.  Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, the Irish seafood industry will benefit from funding of &euro;216m.  A further &euro;118m may be made available on the basis of verified progressive change in the industry as set out in the national strategy for the seafood industry &mdash; Steering a New Course.  I believe that the most critical element in addressing the impact of high fuel prices is to make the fleet more profitable.</P>
        <P>The planned reduction in the size of the fishing fleet, through the Whitefish decommissioning scheme launched in February, will increase the profitability of the vessels that continue to fish because they will be permitted to land higher quantities of quota stocks.  Funding under the NDP will also focus on increasing returns to fishermen through maximising the value of seafood at every stage from the sea to the table.  I also consider that considerable research activity is required in order to identify the most fuel efficient equipment and practices and I will be pushing strongly for this area to be prioritised under the EU&rsquo;s Seventh Framework Programme for Research (2007&ndash;2013).</P>
        <P>At present, Bord Iascaigh Mhara is making grant aid available to improve fuel efficiency on board fishing vessels.  I will keep this scheme under review to ensure that it covers best practice in the context of available research in the area.</P>
        <P>I will continue to ensure that priority will be given to the delivery of the national strategy for the seafood industry &mdash; Steering a New Course (the Cawley report).  I do not consider that the establishment of a specific task force in this area would deliver any additional benefits.</P>

	<P>The Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006 was enacted on the 4th of April 2006 and provides for dissuasive and effective penalties for infringements of fisheries law as required under the Common Fisheries Policy.  On foot of the recent Court of Auditors Report on Fisheries control the Commission is proposing wide-ranging proposals to reform and update the EU Fisheries Control framework and it is likely that the issue of harmonised sanctions will be considered in that light.  In the interim I have asked my Department to review the operation of sanctions under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006 in light of experience since its enactment.</P>
        <P>Officials of my Department will be consulting with, amongst others, industry representatives, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority itself and the Office of the Attorney-General in the <Col N="933"/>course of their review.  This review is ongoing and effort will be made to have it completed by the early autumn.  I await the outcome of this review, and will consider its conclusions carefully.  It is important to note that administrative fines for fisheries offences could be introduced in Ireland if such were a requirement under European law.  I am supportive of any proposals that may be brought forward by the commission in this regard.</P>

	<P>I am not aware of any specific requirements being placed on small animal feed merchants, other than those required of any small business enterprise, that could be considered burdensome red tape.  The Deputy may be referring to a letter distributed by my Department last November, with an end December closing date, to all commercial feed operators involved in the manufacture, storage or handling of animal feed.  In accordance with EU Feed Hygiene Regulations all operators involved in such activity were registered as Feed Business Operators in 2006.  The Regulations require my Department to secure a declaration from these operators, within two years of registration, that they are in compliance with the obligations of such registration, particularly in relation to HACCP and food/feed safety.</P>
        <P>The letter merely reminded the operators of their obligations and asked that the declaration be signed.  A stamped return envelope was provided.  My Department is currently examining the returns.  I am satisfied that this process did not place any undue burden on the businesses concerned.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 365 and 375 together.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the FSAI to ensure that appropriate checks are carried out and any breaches of food labelling legislation should be reported to the FSAI.  EU beef labelling legislation requiring country of origin labelling of beef has been in place since September 2000.  As this legislation did not cover beef sold by the catering trade Minister Coughlan collaborated with the Minister for Health &amp; Children to have national legislation enacted to require that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is enforced by the FSAI.</P>
        <P>Regarding the labelling of poultrymeat, there are EU Regulations which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultrymeat at retail level.  The Regulations require such poultrymeat <Col N="934"/>to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat.  This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  However, it indicated that it would reconsider the draft measures on submission of additional explanatory information.  This information is currently being prepared for transmission to the Commission.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 378 and 381 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a very important position as custodian of some of the largest and richest fishing waters within the EU but also in our location on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.  Illegal fishing practices by all fishing fleets in Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are and have been a matter of ongoing and substantial concern.  Illegal practices militate against the protection of our fisheries resources, and their exploitation in a sustainable way into the future.  Ireland sets and maintains high standards in the enforcement of regulations within our Exclusive Fisheries Zone using the resources of the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  The use of these resources with the addition of satellite monitoring of all fishing vessels both EU and Non-EU allows a high level of monitoring and surveillance of our waters.</P><Col N="939"/>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s control authority, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) which came into being on the 1st January, 2007 has significantly strengthened our capacity to monitor and control illegal fishing activities in Irish waters.  The SFPA and our Naval Service are enhancing their monitoring and inspection systems, with upgraded communications systems, greater co-ordination between agencies and the appointment of additional inspection staff at our ports.  At EU level, agreement was reached late last year on a Regulation on Electronic Recording and Reporting of fishing activity and on a means of remote sensing of fishing vessels.  The new measures oblige fishing vessels to record and submit their logbook by electronic means at least once a day to the control authorities.  The Regulation also allows remote sensing to be used to detect and track fishing vessels.  The electronic logbook will be mandatory for all vessels over 24 metres in length from 1 January 2010 and it will be applied to vessels over 15 m in length from 1 July 2011.</P>
        <P>Following strong pressure from Ireland, including a bi-lateral meeting in the autumn between my predecessor Minister Coughlan and Commissioner Borg, it was agreed that the implementation rules would ensure that each Coastal Member State would have full on-line access in real time to the electronic logbook data and landing declaration data of all vessels operating in its waters.  This measure will substantially strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s controls at sea.  These control measures will substantially strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s ability to monitor and control all fishing activity within its Exclusive Fisheries Zone.  This is particularly important to Ireland because it will give our Naval Service access to catch data of all vessels operating within our Zone and strengthen their ability to target fishing vessels whose catch records would not appear to correspond to the profile of their fishing activity as determined by the vessel monitoring system.  In addition the introduction of remote sensing will help to address instances where fishing vessels eluding monitoring by switching off their VMS system.</P>
        <P>The measures outlined here are vitally important in demonstrating that Ireland is serious about control and for ensuring that all fishing vessels, Irish and non-Irish alike, fully record and report on their catch levels in our waters.  These combined measures will substantially enhance Ireland&rsquo;s ability to effectively control all fishing activity within our waters and ensure that fish stocks in Irish waters are protected from over-fishing.  In addition, the recently established EU Community Fisheries Control Agency will help to improve co-operation and co-ordination between the control authorities of member states.  At European level also, there are new measures under discussion to regulate the activities of EU-flagged vessels outside of Community waters as well as of non-EU vessels wishing to exploit fishing opportunities within EU waters under international agreements.  Ireland also campaigns vigorously for a level playing field on control across all Member States and this will remain one of my top priorities.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the extent to which set-aside lands are being utilised to grow biofuel crops; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The rate of obligatory set-aside has been set at 0% for the 2008 Single Payment Scheme. Therefore, a farmer with set-aside entitlements is not required to put any land into set-aside in order to draw down payments on set-aside entitlements.  A farmer with set-aside entitlements must, however, declare sufficient hectares of land on his/her 2008 Single Payment Scheme application form that, under the provisions of the relevant EU Regulations, are eligible for set-aside.</P><Col N="940"/>
        <P>Given that the closing date for the receipt of applications under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme was just last week, and bearing in mind that applicants have until 31 May 2008 to submit late applications, it will be some weeks before it becomes clear as to the number of hectares being utilised to grow bio-fuels in 2008.  Furthermore, it is difficult to estimate the number of hectares which will be utilised to grow bio-fuels in 2008, largely because of the dramatic price increase during 2007 for crops such as oilseed and the decision on the reduction of compulsory set-aside for 2008 to 0%.  While oilseed has been harvested for the production of pure plant oil and bio-diesel, it is currently attracting significantly higher prices when sold for food purposes.</P>
        <P>With the change in the set-aside rules, farmers in 2008 have much greater freedom as to the use they will make of lands which previously they were required to set-aside i.e. farmers will have the option of growing energy crops on lands previously set-aside.  Under the 2007 Energy Crops Scheme, 2,858 hectares of set-aside land was used to grow various eligible crops.  In 2007, a new National Energy Premium of &euro;80 per hectare and a new Bio-Energy Scheme to assist the development of the production of energy crops in Ireland was introduced.  The &euro;80 National payment supplements the EU Premium of &euro;45 per hectare.  The buoyant market for bio-fuels and the introduction of the &euro;80 incentive contributed to an increase in the area devoted to oilseed rape, which is used to produce bio-fuels.</P>
        <P>The Bio-Energy Scheme aims to encourage farmers to grow willow and miscanthus as a renewable source of energy.  These crops have considerable potential for heat and electricity generation and my Department is aiding establishment with grants of up to &euro;1,450 per hectare.  The introduction of this Scheme has been well received by farmers with some 800 hectares planted so far.  Sufficient funding has been provided in 2008 to support the planting of a further 1,600 hectares.  As a further support measure, land planted with these energy crops can also benefit under the Single Payment Scheme, Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and REPS.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 382 to 384, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>A revised negotiating text on agriculture was issued yesterday evening and a text on non-agricultural market access earlier today.  These texts are being issued with a view to facilitating <Col N="941"/>a final WTO agreement by the end of 2008.  It is by no means clear whether such an agreement will be reached this year.  The range of issues outstanding across the broad spectrum of the negotiations and the US political situation are among the factors that make it uncertain whether an agreement can be secured in the coming period.  Already there is slippage in the negotiating timetable.  A Ministerial meeting, anticipated to take place on 19 May, has been deferred and the latest indications are that it will not now take place until the end of June or even early July.</P>
        <P>Against this background, there is no doubt that these WTO negotiations represent a significant challenge for EU and Irish agriculture. I and my Government colleagues are seeking a balanced and fair outcome across all of the various pillars of the negotiations.  I am very concerned about some of the proposals being made in the agriculture negotiations and with the lack of balance in the overall process.  It is not acceptable that the current negotiations are focused on agriculture while other negotiating areas are not making progress.</P>
        <P>The Irish Government has and will continue to take every opportunity to express our concerns in the strongest terms in the various EU and WTO meetings dealing with these negotiations.  I recently met my French counterpart in Dublin, and the current state of play and imbalance in these WTO negotiations were high on the agenda of this meeting.  I can report that France and Ireland share the same concerns on the direction of these negotiations and will continue to insist that the Commission does not accept a deal which undermines EU agricultural production.</P>
        <P>The Commission, including Commissioner Mandelson and his officials, are well aware of Ireland&rsquo;s views on the matter.  These views have been articulated clearly and consistently at all available forums over the last several years, including bilateral meetings, meetings of the Article 133 Committee, the Agriculture Council and the General Affairs Council and in bilateral meetings with the Commission.    As the negotiations progress I will continue to impress on the Commission that Ireland will not accept an unbalanced agreement which does not provide real benefits to Ireland and the EU.</P>
        <P>At yesterday&rsquo;s Agriculture Council of Ministers meeting, I re-emphasised  to the Agriculture Commissioner, Mrs. Fischer Boel and to the Council as a whole, Ireland&rsquo;s concerns, insisting that any WTO agreement must not place a disproportionate burden on EU and Irish agriculture.  I will also continue to ensure that Ireland plays a leading role in the Group of 14+ like-minded Member States who have come together to express concerns in relation to the direction of the WTO agriculture negotiations.  I will continue to work closely with like-minded Ministers in other Member States to seek support for my position.  At official level, my Department, and other Departments involved, have and will continue to work assiduously in the various technical meetings to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s interests are best protected.</P>
        <P>In summary, I will continue to pursue an outcome which does not undermine the 2003 reforms of the CAP and ensures that Irish and EU agriculture can compete on world markets.  The current world food situation, with demand exceeding supply and stocks falling to unprecedented low levels, underlines the need for Europe to retain a strong agriculture production base.  Security of food supply is firmly back on the European agenda &mdash; this was very clear at the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting yesterday. This was not the situation when we started out on these WTO talks seven years ago &mdash; back then Ireland was a relatively isolated voice on this issue, but the great majority of European agriculture ministers now recognise its importance.  My view is that we must seek to make the CAP more effective in supporting our farmers and food industries.  Our efforts should focus on building a better and stronger CAP, adapted to contemporary needs, not to dismantling a policy that has proven so effective.</P>

Under rules applying to intra Community trade, live animals including animals destined for circuses are certified from points of origin to points of destination. Circus animals generally do not come within the ambit of the computerised EU animal movement system (TRACES) which in any event only holds data for a period of 4 months. </P>

	<P>The revised Farm Waste Management Scheme, introduced in order to assist farmers meet the additional requirements of the Nitrates Directive, was launched in March 2006 following the receipt of EU state aid approval for the Scheme.   The EU Commission approval specifically states that all work must be completed by farmers under the Scheme by end-December 2008 in order to qualify for the grants available.  The final date for completion of work has been very well publicised and I have no plans to approach the EU Commission to seek an extension of that deadline and all applicants were advised of the situation.</P>

	<P>The project for the school referred to by the Deputy has advanced to the stage that the Department has agreed the Schedule of Accommodation for a new 16-classroom school. The site required for the new school has now been acquired and the process of appointing a design team has commenced. The Department published the advertisement seeking qualified consultants on the public procurement website in January 2008. These re-qualification questionnaires have been received in the Department for assessment and the Department will be back in contact with the school authorities on this matter as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In the interim period pending the provision of a new school building the Department has approved the rental of one further temporary classroom for this school for September 2008 to cater for its immediate accommodation needs. In addition the Department also funded grant-aid of &euro;394,771.72 in 2007 for the provision of adequate car-parking facilities for this school.  The building project required to deliver the new school building will be progressed in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme and availability of funding.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The teaching of computer literacy to those over 50 years of age is delivered through a number of <Col N="944"/>current initiatives.  Through The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI), the Department provides funding for part time learning opportunities for adults.  Information and Communications Technology courses feature prominently within BTEI provision. Participants undertake programmes in ICT for both personal and vocational reasons.  </P>
        <P>Older people are specifically prioritised within BTEI, as one of a number of target groups.  In 2007 over 5,000 participants on BTEI programmes were aged over 55 years. This represents 20.6% of BTEI participants overall, 12.7% of participants were aged between 55 and 64, with a further 7.9% aged over 65.  In 2007, the number of BTEI places was increased by 1,000 bringing the total number to 9,000.  An additional 500 places has been allocated in 2008.  Adult Literacy classes include literacy tuition through the use of computers.  In 2005, 4,400 participants over the age of 55 availed of the Adult Literacy service provided through the VECs.  In 2006 this number increased to 5,200 participants. The number of older people availing of adult literacy tuition represents 13% of the overall number of people availing of the service.   In 2007, the number of Adult Literacy places was increased by 3,000 serving almost 44,000 participants.  Provision has been made in the Revised Estimates for an additional 500 places this year.</P>
        <P>Under the Community Education Programme, older people also participate in computer classes, language classes and hobby type courses, funded mainly through the provision of tutor hours.   The Department also provides funding to Age Action Ireland for a project entitled University of the Third Age (U3A). This is part of an international movement to support active ageing through the development of self-help learning circles for older people who are no longer working full time. The learning activities include computer training for older people.</P>

	<P>Data on the average annual cost of living for higher education students is not collected annually. The main source of data is the Eurostudent Survey, which is conducted with other research in this area by the Higher Education Authority.  The second survey in the series, published in 2005, indicated that the average monthly expenditure (excluding tobacco, alcohol and entertainment) incurred by a student residing at home was &euro;340 and &euro;672 for those living away from home.  It is anticipated that the 2007 Eurostudent study will be ready for publication towards the end of 2008. </P>

	<P>A person with a degree on the list of approved qualifications is automatically entitled to be considered for registration with the Teaching Council (all other requirements being satisfied) provided that the subject coverage in his/her undergraduate degree meets the general and specific requirements for at least one curricular subject. These subject specific requirements are available on the website of the Teaching Council.  For example, a person with a BSc degree shown on the list of approved qualifications is not automatically registered to teach all science subjects. An applicant must take a curricular subject as a major subject in the degree extending over at least three years and of the order of 30% at a minimum of that period.</P>
        <P>All applications for registration are individually assessed to determine that the undergraduate qualification(s) of the applicant satisfy the general and specific requirements for curricular <Col N="947"/>subjects referred to above.  In a small number of cases, a person with a qualification included on the list of approved qualifications (e.g. a Bachelor of Arts) will present for registration with insufficient undergraduate academic time spent on any post-primary curricular subject in his or her degree. In these cases, the person cannot be registered.  One of the roles of the Council is to maintain and improve standards of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence. The assessment of all applications for registration in the manner referred to above ensures that the Council is fulfilling this role.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 399 to 402, inclusive, and 429 together.</P>
        <P>Projects are usually activated by an application from the relevant school authority for capital works or on foot of the outcome of an Area Development Plan initiated by my Department. The estimated cost of a project cannot be easily determined at this initial stage.  Generally before establishing the scope of such capital works, the viability and long term future of the school is verified through examination of existing data on pupil numbers at the school and in the general area and, in the case of post-primary schools, in the feeder primary schools within the catchment area. Consultation with patrons and other education providers in the general area and with Local Authorities and examination of local area development plans may also be required.</P>
        <P>The scope of the works is established through visiting the school(s) involved and through preparation of technical reports by my Department&rsquo;s professional and technical staff.  The <Col N="948"/>priority rating of each major project is established in accordance with the Criteria for Prioritising Capital Projects which allocates each project to an appropriate priority band rating on the basis of objective criteria. Following a review of the criteria, undertaken in 2004 in consultation with the Education Partners, amended criteria were applied to all projects from 2005 onwards. In general the cost of a proposed project would have no bearing on its band rating.</P>
        <P>It would not be realistic to try to estimate with any accuracy the potential cost of all building projects on hand in my Department. A variety of factors can affect the final cost of a project.  Site size/conditions, demographic trends, technical assessment of the existing buildings etc., requirement for new buildings, extension to existing schools or refurbishment of existing schools will all affect the cost of the various projects, as will the trend in building costs in the broader economy.  Ultimately it is only when a project has been tendered that an accurate cost becomes available.</P>
        <P>Projects are assigned a band rating as follows:</P>
<P el="10"><i>Band 1</i></P>
<P el="0">Band 1 projects address:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The needs of schools in rapidly developing areas.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The provision of specialist accommodation for special needs pupils.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Schools with structural issues.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Rationalisation projects.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Band 2</i></P>
<P el="0"><Miles com="ix" />Band 2 addresses the needs of schools that have a deficit of mainstream accommodation and/or require refurbishment.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Band 3</i></P>
<P el="0"><Miles com="ix" />Band 3 addresses the needs of schools that have no deficit of mainstream accommodation but that have a deficit of ancillary accommodation.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Band 4</i></P>
<P el="0"><Miles com="ix" />Band 4 addresses the needs of schools that have desirable but not urgent needs.</P>
        <P>When it is necessary to select projects from within the same band, as a general principle, projects will be selected on the basis of enrolment stability; projects that have been the longest period in the planning process and the most cost effective solution. In this regard, it should be noted that a project&rsquo;s banding, or classification, can be subject to reassessment having regard to demographic developments in the area served by the school and also, for example, if on foot of a technical examination of the school it was found that the proposed project put forward by the school was not an appropriate design solution to meet the accommodation requirements.</P>
        <P>The number of school building projects categorised by band rating is as follows: Band 1: 330; Band 2: 800; Band 3: 244; Band 4: 54</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware that my Department has put in place a range of teaching and care supports for pupils with special educational needs, including those with Down Syndrome.  Pupils with Down Syndrome are entitled to additional teaching support in school, either under the terms of the general allocation system for children with high incidence special needs or through an allocation of additional resources where a pupil has been assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need. One of the benefits of the general allocation system is that it has put support teaching resources in place in schools on a more systematic basis.  This facilitates flexible and early intervention and gives schools more certainty about their resource levels.</P>
        <P>In circumstances where a pupil with Down Syndrome has other associated needs and would fall into the low incidence disability categories, schools can apply to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for an additional resource teaching allocation. The number of additional teaching hours allocated would range from three to five hours per week depending on the pupil&rsquo;s special educational needs. Special needs assistant posts are allocated to schools to support students with care needs.  Funding has been made available to enable schools support students with special educational needs with specialist furniture and/or assistive technology if necessary and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.  Applications for such support are made through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser.  These supports are targeted at the special educational needs of the pupils concerned.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 405, 406 and 407 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is providing broadband connectivity to recognised primary and post-primary schools under the Schools Broadband Access Programme. This programme is being undertaken in partnership with industry in the context of a Government &mdash; IBEC/TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) Agreement to provide local broadband connectivity to schools.   The Programme has three elements &mdash; local connectivity to schools, a national broadband network and a broadband support service desk. Schools connectivity is being routed to the Internet through a national broadband network, which is supported by HEAnet and provides centrally managed services for schools such as security, anti-spam/ anti-virus and content filtering. The broadband support service desk has been established to interface between the network, the local broadband service Access Providers and schools.  It is managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE).</P>
        <P>The total costs of the Programme for the first three years, including the initial set-up costs, are some &euro;30m. Schools are not required to meet the costs of their broadband connectivity under the Programme. The Agreement provides for the establishment of a three year &euro;18m joint Government-IBEC/TIF Fund, with industry contributing &euro;5m per annum and the Government contributing &euro;1m per annum.  To date the receipts to the Fund comprise the State&rsquo;s contributions of &euro;3m and &euro;8.03m from IBEC/TIF contributing members.    The costs associated with the broadband network, the help-desk and the routers in schools are met by my Department.  In addition, there are staffing costs in the NCTE and my Department associated with the operation and management of the Programme, which are met from the overall provision for each organisation.</P>
        <P>A competitive, technology neutral, central procurement process for the provision of local connectivity for schools was undertaken based on a tiered bandwidth provision, ranging from 0.5 Megabits per second (Mbps) in the case of small primary schools up to 2 Mbps for larger post-primary schools.   Contracts were finalised in 2005 with six Service Providers for the provision of local access connectivity to 3,925 schools and with a further Provider for the installation of a broadband router at school level where appropriate.  The 3,925 initial individual school awards involved a range of technologies.  Roll-out commenced in June 2005.  The installation process has two stages starting with the local broadband connectivity installation followed by the installation of a high-speed router and circuit and acceptance testing.</P>
        <P>The total number of schools involved in the Programme has been adjusted in the meantime to reflect a number of school openings, closures and amalgamations and stands currently at 3,936. As of 24th April, 2008, 3,907 (99%) have had their local connectivity installed and of these 3,904 have had their router capability installed and tested.   The number and percentage of schools that have had their local connectivity installed is 3,211 (99%) at primary level and 696 (99%) at post-primary level.  There are 29 schools that have yet to be connected to the Network.  Of these 15 schools have been awarded service providers and their installation is being progressed.  2 schools were not bid for by any service provider, 8 schools have refused the service on the basis that their existing broadband service is preferred or because of concerns regarding the particular service offered and 4 schools have outstanding issues in relation to building works that have delayed the installation.</P><Col N="951"/>
        <P>Of the 3,907 local connectivity installations, 27% have fixed line services, 26% have wireless services and 47% have satellite services.  Having regard to the usage levels observed by HEAnet, my Department has procured additional bandwidth from its two satellite providers to improve the broadband connection speeds for schools on this portion of the Schools Broadband Network.  The situation continues to be monitored closely.  Another development has been that increased bandwidths have been provided to some schools with fixed line services as a consequence of improvements in the wholesale broadband market.  Over 650 schools are now receiving bandwidths of 3Mbps or higher. In addition, my Department has migrated schools to superior alternative technology, where feasible.  A further 72 schools have had broadband access provided under the Hermes and Advanced Deployment programmes.  Where feasible, these schools have been connected to the national broadband network and to date, 66 of these schools have been connected.</P>
        <P>My Department will shortly issue a Request for Tenders for the next round of service.  The priority for the new procurement process will be to ensure that the broadband services to schools keep in line with national infrastructure improvements. The RFT will seek tenders which at least maintain the existing service (in terms of speed and reliability) that schools currently receive. Having regard to the general developments in broadband availability nationally, improved service offerings are expected to be received under the new tender process.</P>

The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  In this context, the status of all schools in Rush are being assessed. The school referred to by the Deputy is being included in this assessment.  As is the case with all large capital projects currently on hand within the Unit, their progression will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 409 to 416, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There are a range of measures in place to safeguard personal data held by various business units in my Department. My Department has produced a set of guidelines for all staff which sets out the issues to be considered when collecting, storing and processing personal data. These guidelines were approved by the Data Protection Commissioner in 2007. The guidelines were circulated to all staff in the Department and are also available on the Department&rsquo;s Intranet.  Staff are made aware of their obligations under the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003 at induction training courses. In addition, my Department is currently rolling out records management training courses to staff, part of which covers data protection issues.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;Computer and Network Usage Policy&rsquo;, which was in place at the time of these thefts, covers the use of laptops as well as desktop computers.  The officials who were using the laptops that were stolen reported the laptop thefts to the Department&rsquo;s Personnel Section and IT Unit as required by the policy.  My Department is in the process of finalising a &lsquo;Policy for use of laptops and other portable electronic devices&rsquo; and this will be issued to all staff shortly.  The laptop stolen from the Department&rsquo;s offices in Marlborough Street did not contain personal data.</P><Col N="953"/>
        <P>The laptop which was stolen from an Inspector&rsquo;s car contained draft reports on quality and standards in the classrooms of teachers on probation. As this laptop was used by the Inspector for occasional work only, an exact list of the draft reports on the laptop at the time it was stolen is not available.   However, it is estimated that there were approximately ten reports at various stages of drafting on the laptop when it was stolen.  While the draft reports contained the name of the teacher and the roll no. of the school where they were teaching, and certain information in relation to the performance of teaching duties, the reports did not contain personal information such as date of birth, home address etc.  The reporting template provides for inclusion of PPSN but it is understood that this was not included on any draft reports contained on the laptop. The stolen laptops had a dual level of password protection. The Department did not notify the Data Protection Commissioners of the theft of this laptop given the type and volume of information involved.</P>
        <P>A third laptop was stolen from the home of an Inspector in 2007.  The theft was reported to the Department&rsquo;s Personnel Unit and IT Unit.   The laptop did not contain personal data.</P>

        <Quest> his views on criticisms of his Department&rsquo;s circular 0044/2007 in respect of the teaching of English in gaelscoileanna; and his further views on the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment&rsquo;s proposals regarding language and literacy in Irish-medium primary schools. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Circular 044/2007, issued in July 2007, requires all schools to provide the minimum recommended tuition in English in Irish medium primary schools, beginning no later than the start of the second term in Junior Infants.  The revised primary curriculum was launched in 1999 after extensive consultation with the partners in education. Page 27 in the Introduction to the Curriculum states &ldquo;It is a particular feature of Irish primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have experience of language learning in two languages.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Fundamentally this issue is about access by all children to the full national curriculum.  My Department&rsquo;s policy in this area, which has been set out in replies to Parliamentary Questions, is that all schools, including Irish medium schools, should provide the minimum recommended instruction time in English in the infant classes of 2.5 hours per week.  There are compelling public policy reasons why an &ldquo;a la carte&rdquo; approach to curricular provision should not be encouraged.  The current debate is about availability of English at the early stages of primary schooling but one could readily see why similar arguments could be advanced in relation to the required provision of other areas of the curriculum.  It is also quite likely that delaying the introduction of English would have the effect of deterring the enrolment of disadvantaged and special needs pupils which would run counter to the State&rsquo;s policy of maximum inclusion.</P>
        <P>The question of deferring a decision was considered in relation to this matter pending a research project to ascertain the impact on student performance of various models of immersion education.  Such research is, in any event, likely to be inconclusive, given the many variables (socio economic status, school practice, variations in first language at home of students etc) that are at play here.  In any event, research will, by its nature, focus on but one subset (learning impact) of what is a significantly wider public policy matter and it would be inappropriate to base a decision purely on research or indeed to delay a decision pending any such research.  The issue of the circular is currently subject to Judicial Review. In addition, my Department has undertaken a consultation process, with a deadline for feedback of 31 May,  on proposals to prescribe the primary curriculum by regulation.</P>

	<P>To meet the needs of migrant pupils for whom English is a second language English Language Support Teachers have been appointed to primary and post-primary schools. There are now just under 2,000 language support teachers in the schools at a cost of &euro;120 million per annum.  Schools with less than the 14 such pupils needed to qualify for one support teacher are provided with financial resources to assist them.</P><Col N="956"/>
        <P>The National Council on Curriculum and Assessment has developed Intercultural Guidelines, one for primary schools and one for post-primary schools, to support teachers and schools in developing a more inclusive learning environment and in providing students with the knowledge and skills they need to participate in an diverse society.  There are also resources available specifically for English Language Support Teachers and other resources for the whole school team.</P>
        <P>A number of research projects are also underway: The Inspectorate is conducting an evaluation of the provision of English as an Additional Language (EAL) in a number of primary and post-primary schools in 2008 and 2009. A report will be prepared for mid 2009.</P>
        <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) is undertaking a large-scale study into how an increasing diversity of students impacts upon resource requirements and day to day teaching and learning in primary and post-primary schools.

These pre-qualification questionnaires have been received in the Department for assessment and the Department will be back in contact with the school authorities on this matter as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In the interim period pending the provision of a new school building the Department has approved the rental of one further temporary classroom for this school for September 2008 to cater for its immediate accommodation needs.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special needs supports on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The SENOs operate within the policy outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circulars for allocating such support.</P>
        <P>Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. All schools have contact details of their local SENO. It is also open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, including issues that arise in relation to transition from primary to post-primary level, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</P>
        <P>When a child in primary school has been in receipt of additional resource teaching and other educational resources, it is appropriate that these supports should be reviewed by the NCSE at the end of the primary school cycle.  Where children are in receipt of additional resources in primary school, it is the responsibility of the post primary school to which they have enrolled to submit an application to the local SENO, prior to the child&rsquo;s transfer, seeking the supports required for the child in post primary school.</P>
        <P>Such applications should be accompanied by any relevant assessment and attainment information, including information on the child&rsquo;s educational progress. Resources will then be made available by the NCSE to the school at the appropriate level and in a speedy manner taking into account the resources that may already be available within the school.  The NCSE issues specific guidelines to schools in this regard each year.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It should be noted that the responsibility for sound financial management of schools&rsquo; affairs rests with school authorities and these were exceptional payments.  Funding to schools to cover their day-to-day running costs has increased substantially in recent years.  With increases in capitation and ancillary services funding, primary schools are now getting &euro;105 more per pupil per year than they were in 2002.  The capitation grant has been increased to &euro;178.58 per child, and the ancillary services grant has risen to &euro;151.50 per child, bringing the total value of both grants to &euro;330 per pupil.  This amounts to almost &euro;100,000 a year for a 300-pupil school.</P>
        <P>There have also been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools.  With effect from January 2008, the standard per capita grant was increased by &euro;15 per pupil and now amounts to &euro;331 per pupil.  In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of &euro;15 per pupil in 2008 in the support services grant bringing that grant to &euro;204 per pupil.  The cumulative increase of &euro;30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to &euro;535 per pupil.  These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.  For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;300,000.</P>
        <P>Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector along with those in the VEC sector are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant.  All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.  Schools have, therefore, benefited from major increases in funding in recent years.  The Deputy will be aware that as well as general increases in capitation funding, extra financial supports are being provided to schools under the DEIS action plan for educational inclusion.  In the current school year, DEIS related grants totalling almost &euro;19 million were paid to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The comparable amount paid for 2006/2007 was almost &euro;17 million.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to prioritise the needs of schools serving disadvantaged communities going forward.  The emphasis on tackling educational disadvantage in recent years is absolutely unprecedented.  In 2008, we are investing over &euro;800 million in measures aimed at tackling disadvantage at all levels.  This represents an increase of nearly &euro;70 million on the 2007 figure and an almost 74% increase on the &euro;460 million provided in 2003.  As well as continuing to prioritise disadvantaged schools, we are also determined to ensure that both primary and post-primary schools benefit from increased funding over the next five years.  The Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to double the standard capitation grant for primary schools.  Grants to schools for the employment of secretaries and caretakers will also be increased significantly.  In summary, therefore, we have substantially increased funding for schools and will prioritise further improvements in the years ahead.</P>

        <Quest> the reason a retired teacher works as a temporary teacher for the purposes of filling in or replacing a permanent teacher in a local school, that for the number of days that they work, they are unable to receive their appropriate pension entitlements for those days; if he will confirm that this is the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Where the nature of the pension awarded to the teacher on initial retirement does not debar a return to employment, such a return to work may give rise to abatement of pension.  Abatement is a standard feature of public service pension schemes and is the mechanism used to ensure that the combined earnings (pension plus pay) do not exceed the uprated pay on which the pension is based.  Where a teacher returns in a temporary capacity for any period of wholetime daily employment and is in receipt of incremental salary and allowances for that period, pension is stopped.</P>

	<P>While my Department does not operate a specific national scheme for the provision of homework clubs, it supports a range of programmes which target additional resources at pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in order to facilitate their full participation in the education system.  In assessing applications for funding, my Department gives consideration to interventions already in place and supported by my Department in the areas concerned so as to avoid duplication of effort and resource.  My Department currently supports 27 schools (8 post primary and 19 primary schools) in 6 School Completion Projects in this area under DEIS, the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  The 6 School Completion Projects receive over &euro;1.2 million in total annually which targets approx. 1355 young people and 71 out of school students.</P>
        <P>In addition, there are a variety of other interventions in place in these schools under DEIS such as reduced class sizes, appointment of administrative principals on lower enrolments, a range of literacy/numeracy initiatives, Free Book Grant Scheme and meal provision.  The Home School Community Liaison Scheme helps to get parents involved in their children&rsquo;s education, which as we all know is a crucial component of convincing young people of the value of education.  Additional financial resources amounting to &euro;619,820 has been allocated to the schools in this area under DEIS.  These financial supports allocated to each of the schools selected under DEIS provides for the inclusion of after school and holiday time support &mdash; for literacy and numeracy development as well as homework support, social and personal development and arts activities.</P>
        <P>The objective of the School Completion Programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education and aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process, entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.  It is based on the project model with an integrated approach involving primary and post primary schools, parents and relevant statutory, voluntary and community agencies.  The programme is funded <Col N="960"/>on a multi-annual basis under the National Development Plan (NDP) and up to 2007 with assistance from the European Social Fund (ESF).</P>
        <P>A local management committee, comprising representatives of schools and other relevant agencies, manage each project.  Projects are required to engage in a consultative and planning process with the school staff, with parents and with local representatives of relevant statutory, voluntary and community agencies in the development of annual retention plans.  What makes the School Completion Programme unique is its &lsquo;bottom up&rsquo; approach, which allows the local management committees to put together plans and supports that target the needs of local young people at risk of early school leaving.  Each project employs a local Co-ordinator to run the project at local level.</P>
        <P>A member of the National Coordination Team for SCP will make contact with the Homework Club to which the Deputy refers and with the Schools and SCP projects in the area, with a view to establishing the needs in the area with regard to homework provision.</P>

	<P>While my Department does not operate a specific national scheme for the provision of homework clubs, it supports a range of programmes which target additional resources at pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in order to facilitate their full participation in the education system.  In the region of &euro;800 million will be spent by my Department this year on tackling educational disadvantage at all levels from pre-school to further and higher education.  This represents an increase of nearly &euro;70 million on the comparable 2007 figure and is testament to the Government&rsquo;s determination to prioritise social inclusion and ensure that all our children and young people get the supports they need to do well at school.  Social Inclusion measures across all Government departments have also been prioritised under the Towards 2016 agreement, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-16 and the National Development Plan.</P>
        <P>In the current school year, grants totalling almost &euro;19 million were paid to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds under DEIS (the Action plan for Educational Inclusion).  These financial supports allocated to each of the schools selected under DEIS provides for the inclusion of after school and holiday time support &mdash; for literacy and numeracy development as well as homework support, social and personal development and arts activities.</P>
        <P>Preventative measures are also in place such as the Home School Community Liaison Scheme which helps to get parents involved in their children&rsquo;s education, which as we all know is a crucial component of convincing young people of the value of education.  Under the School Completion Programme children at risk of early school leaving are targeted for a variety of extra supports, educational and non-educational, during and outside of school time &mdash; all aimed at encouraging them to stay in school.  There are 124 School Completion projects spanning 26 counties, comprising 224 post-primary schools and 468 primary schools.</P>
        <P>After-school activities are delivered as part of the School Completion Programme and homework clubs in particular are a widely implemented support to provide students with a structured environment to complete homework.  After-School Supports provided under the School Completion Programme focus on the personal and social development of young people, aiming to enrich their overall educational experience by providing fun activities that tap into the many talents of young people.  Programmes that focus on activities like Drama, Music, Art, Craftwork <Col N="961"/>and Sport enable children to develop a range of creative and sporting skills.  These activities help to boost self-esteem, have positive consequences for the classroom and are particularly important for academically weaker students.</P>
        <P>A local management committee, comprising representatives of schools and other relevant agencies, manage each project.  Projects are required to engage in a consultative and planning process with the school staff, with parents and with local representatives of relevant statutory, voluntary and community agencies in the development of annual retention plans.

	<P>There are some 156 cases before the Courts which involve the Department as a Defendant or Respondent.  They include litigation relating to Primary and Post-Primary Schools, Community and Comprehensive Schools, Special Educational Needs, school non-attendance, school transport, employment law matters, (including salaries and pensions), litigation arising from industrial relations actions and/or appeals to the Courts from decisions of the Equality Tribunal, contractual disputes and a diverse range of matters.</P>
        <P>This figure does not include childhood abuse cases, which largely relate to industrial and reformatory schools and residential institutions.  These would amount to approximately 170 primary day school childhood abuse litigation cases and 118 Residential Institutions childhood abuse litigation cases.  There are an additional 652 Residential Institutions litigation cases in which legal proceedings were initiated but they are not currently before the Courts.  However, it is not possible to indicate what percentage of these cases would actually reach a hearing, as a large number of cases are discontinued following the acceptance by the plaintiffs of awards made by the Redress Board.  Accordingly, it would not be entirely accurate to describe the Department as being currently engaged in these proceedings in any manner comparable to those which are actively before the Courts.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the term &lsquo;legal actions&rsquo; does not encompass inquiries conducted under Rule 108 of the Rules for National Schools, statutory inquiries held pursuant to the provisions of the Vocational Education Acts 1930-2006, or matters which are before the Equality Tribunal, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, LRC, Labour Court and other statutory industrial relations mechanisms available under the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003, Maternity Protection Acts 1994-2004, Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-2005.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that all children including those with special needs <Col N="963"/>can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum with the option, in line with each child&rsquo;s ability, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</P>
        <P>Parents of children with autism now have three distinct choices available to them: their child can attend a mainstream class in their local school with additional supports as required; they can attend a special autism-specific class in a mainstream school or in a special school.  While some children with autism can thrive in a mainstream class, special classes have been specifically designed to meet the needs of those who require more intensive support.  Children in these classes benefit from having fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).  Teachers can tailor these to the needs of the individual child.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs.  In excess of 315 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, while more may be set up as required. 13 of these classes are in Co. Kerry.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently funding a number of ABA pilot centres which were established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools.  The Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot programme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable them to be supported them as primary schools for children with autism.  I am pleased to advise that the issue is being actively progressed.  However, now that a national network of special classes catering specifically for children with autism is available in schools, new centres will not be brought into the pilot programme.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the benefits to schools deriving from the Summer Works Scheme.  Since the scheme was introduced in 2004, over 3,000 projects costing in excess of &euro;300 million have been completed.  With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, my Department is focusing on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008.  Accordingly, there is no Summer Works Scheme for 2008.  However, it is intended to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties that parents of children attending a special needs school (details supplied) in County Cork are encountering in finding suitably qualified teachers to <Col N="965"/>provide tuition under his Department&rsquo;s July provision programme for special schools; and his views on allowing special needs assistants to give the tuition under the scheme. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware the July Education Programme is available to all special schools and mainstream primary schools with special classes catering for children with autism who choose to extend their education services through the month of July.  My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability.  My Department encourages all eligible schools to participate in this initiative in the interest of the children in question.  There has been a steady increase in the number of schools offering the programme since it was introduced in 2001 when relevant schools were circulated with details.</P>
        <P>Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.  As home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned.  My Department&rsquo;s qualification preference is for a fully qualified teacher.  Where parents cannot recruit a fully qualified teacher, then some alternative qualifications are acceptable including certain Montessori qualifications.  Details in this regard are published on my Department&rsquo;s web site.</P>

The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered on an on-going basis in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.   </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 446 to 448, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age.  Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My <Col N="966"/>Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
        <P>Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 62 and 63 of 13 November 2007, the progress the National Council for Special Education has made in the compilation of data in relation to the number of children with special educational needs in schools and the number of children who have been allocated resources; the details of their findings; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs. The NCSE also has a research function and part of this remit is to advise my Department on policy matters upon undertaking appropriate research and analysis.  My officials have been in contact with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) regarding the compilation of data in relation to the number of children with special educational needs in schools and the number of children who have been allocated resources and have been advised that the work in compiling this data is ongoing. The NCSE hope to have this work completed by the end of the year. </P>

        <P FLI="0">The key issue in the provision of medical services to the Defence Forces at this time is the acknowledged shortage of Medical Officers (Doctors) in the Medical Corps. The establishment for doctors is forty seven (47).  The current strength of Medical Officers serving in the Defence Forces is twenty two (22).  The challenges facing the Medical Corps have been recognized for some time and a review of the provision of medical services is ongoing as part of the Modernisation Agenda for the Defence Forces. The Representative Associations are involved in this review.  The scope of the review includes the level of service to be provided to members of the Defence Forces and the resources required for the delivery of that service.</P>
        <P>Given the ongoing issues and mindful of the need to make progress in this area I have decided to engage consultants to make recommendations on the best means of meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces. Tender documents for the consultancy have been evaluated and it is expected that a contract will be awarded shortly.</P>

	<P>The Law Reform Commission has indicated that it will publish, in the coming weeks, its Report on Multi-Unit Developments which, following an extensive consultation process, will contain definitive reform proposals concerning the regulation and governance of property management companies. The Government has already directed that early action be taken by the relevant Departments to address the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations; the types of action to be taken will, of course, be dependent on the form that the recommendations take.</P>
        <P>A high-level interdepartmental committee, under the chairmanship of my Department, comprising representatives of relevant Departments and Offices has been established to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive response to the problems arising in relation to multi-unit developments. A key task of this committee will be to identify the legislative and other actions to be taken in response to the Commission&rsquo;s reform recommendations and to determine a timescale for their implementation. This committee is reporting to a Cabinet Committee whose membership comprises the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Attorney General.</P>

	<P>No costs of the kind sought by the Deputy are available at present.  My Department, however, is examining  the issue of paternity leave as part of an overall review of maternity, parental and paternity leave as promised in the Agreed Programme for Government and the Social Partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;.  Costings in relation to the provision of paid paternity leave will, no doubt, be prepared as  part of this review.  This review will be conducted by my Department with input from other relevant Government Departments and from the social partners.  The issue of the introduction of a statutory entitlement to paternity leave was examined before, in 2002, by a Working Group, membership of which included Government Departments and the Social Partners, as part of the Review of the Parental Leave Act 1998.  The Working Group could not reach consensus on the issue.  </P>

	<P>For 2008, an amount of &euro;9.2 million was allocated to my Office in the Estimates.  This is being used to create new funding lines and establish new integration structures as outlined in my recent policy statement, Migration Nation, as well as to support existing initiatives.  In line with the policy I have announced, a special emphasis is being placed on funding membership organisations, faith-based groups and building local structures  I expect to allocate around &euro;3 million for these areas in 2008.</P>
        <P>Since I took office, actual expenditure and planned expenditure for the remainder of 2008 under the European Social Fund to support immigrants in gaining employment and/or further education and training amount to &euro;750,000.  &euro;4.4 million has been made available for other integration-related projects such as, for example, initiatives to support the integration of legally resident immigrants.  My Office also operates a small grants scheme to support community and voluntary efforts at a local level.  Expenditure on this since I took office and planned for 2008, is &euro;525,000.  In the area of addressing racism I am providing approximately &euro;1.05 million this year through the National Action Plan against Racism (NPAR) and &euro;500,000 is being used to fund the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism.  The NPAR allocation is used primarily to make strategic interventions in the implementation of the Plan, to pursue specific research projects and to undertake public awareness/information initiatives and grants schemes.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above measures, which are funded in 2008 from the &euro;9.2 million allocation in respect of my Office, &euro;1.2 million is available from the European Refugee Fund and a further &euro;1.6 million from the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals.  Pobal is administering these Funds on behalf of my Office and they have recently decided on the projects to be supported following a call for proposals and formal appraisal.</P>

	<P>Long term residency is an administrative scheme that was introduced in May 2004 and is focused on persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit / work authorisation / work visa conditions.  Such persons may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</P>
        <P>While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  I have been informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that they have recently been in contact with the person referred to by the Deputy in relation to his immigration status.  Further documentation has been requested from the person concerned in order to facilitate the Immigration Division in examining his case.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Immigration Division of My Department, that the person referred to by the Deputy received permission to remain in the State for one year on work permit conditions.  An application in respect of the person in question was received by the Immigration Division on the 13th March 2008, seeking an extension of his work permit permission as he was in a <i>de facto</i> relationship.  The Immigration Division replied to that application on the 8th May 2008 stating that the Department could not accept the submitted application, as it did not provide documented evidence that he and his partner had been in a relationship for four years.</P>
        <P>There are no provisions in Irish immigration law or procedure, or in EU law,  whereby a non-EEA national may obtain permission to reside in the State on the basis of a relationship with an Irish national, except where the person in question is the spouse or an immediate dependent family member of the Irish national in question.  However, it is open to any non-national to make an application to be allowed reside in the State in which case, the nature and duration of that person&rsquo;s relationship with an Irish national, as well the person&rsquo;s capacity to support himself or herself without recourse to public funds, would be taken into account in determining whether or not permission would be granted.</P>

	<P>As outlined in Parliamentary Question No. 249 put down for answer on 24 April, 2008, an application from the person referred to by the Deputy was received by the Immigration Division of my Department on the 5th July 2006 seeking long term residency.  This application was refused on 24 October 2006, as the individual did not meet the minimum criteria of over five years in the State on work permit conditions.  On two occasions the Immigration Division of my Department granted the person referred to by the Deputy, Stamp 1 conditions for a four-month period in order to obtain a work permit.</P>
        <P>To date the Immigration Division has not received any further applications for long term residency from this person and therefore are unable to confirm if he meets the minimum criteria for the long term residency scheme.  I have been informed by the Immigration Division that it is open to the person referred to by the Deputy to submit a fresh application in respect of himself and his dependants when he has completed five years legal residency (60 months of Stamp 1 endorsements on his passport) in the State, on work permit conditions. On receipt of such an application, the case will be considered on its own merits.</P>
        <P>Dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Under <Col N="973"/>current legislation, persons under the age of 16 are not currently requested to register or obtain permission to remain in the State.  Dependants of the person referred to by the Deputy will have to be resident in the State for a minimum of five years following their 16th birthday before they can be permitted to apply for long term residency.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 462 and 463 together.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service has made significant progress in meeting the commitments contained in the Programme for Government relating to rehabilitation for prisoners.  Prisoner rehabilitation involves significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and in-reaching statutory and non-statutory services.  Amongst these are health care, psychiatric, psychological, educational, work and training, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These services are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management, and self management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development in prisoners, and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.</P>
        <P>The Probation Service has an active role during the course of the prisoner&rsquo;s sentence in helping maintain links with family and community agencies, encouraging prisoners to address their offending behaviour and engaging prisoners in individual counselling and group counselling programmes such as offending behaviour, addiction, violence and sex offending.  The Service also provides supervision in certain cases under temporary release provisions.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service places a strong emphasis on access to educational services and on the provision of work and training activities for prisoners.  As a result of the Programme for Organisational Change, there has been a significant expansion and development of vocational training programmes.  The Work Training Service comprises an authorised complement of over 250 prison service posts and there are over 90 workshops operating in our prisons actively catering for in excess of 800 prisoners each day.  Training activities are chosen to give as much employment as possible for those in prison and to give opportunities to acquire skills which will help them secure employment on their release.  External accreditation of certified training is available for a number of courses run within the institutions.</P>
        <P>Educational services are now available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community including the VECs, Public Library Services, Colleges and the Arts Council.  Broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach.  During the academic year 2007/08, 220 whole-time-equivalent VEC teachers were the main providers of these education programmes.</P><Col N="974"/>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service is also delivering programmes aimed at reducing the demand for drugs within the prison system through enhanced security measures as well as education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  The Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy &mdash; Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons &mdash; caters for the expansion of existing drug treatment programmes and further recruitment of dedicated staff.  The expansion of these services is being achieved in partnership with community based services and will see a significant improvement in the range, quality and availability of drug treatment service in the prisons.  Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  Particular initiatives include the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, an information forum, addiction counselling, drug therapy programmes and the operation of drug free units.</P>
        <P>Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at any level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention.  In this regard, there are three forms of direct therapeutic intervention currently available &mdash; i.e., individual counselling from the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Psychology Service and from the Probation Service; the Sex Offender Programme which has been in operation since 1994, and the Psychiatric Service which provides some support to prisoners in this category.</P>
        <P>Significant progress is also being made in the development of programmes based on risk assessment and rehabilitation needs. The Irish Prison Service is developing and rolling-out, between now and 2012, a fully coordinated Integrated Sentence Management System (ISM) across all prisons and places of detention.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 464 to 466, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government, insofar as it relates to penal matters, contains proposals about revising the system of sentence remission for prisoners. These include lowering the rate of remission available to violent offenders and making its award conditional on various factors.  The Programme also includes further proposals on post release supervision in the community for former prisoners.</P><Col N="975"/>
        <P>Traditionally, 25% remission of sentence is granted to the majority of prisoners.  The use of remission in this way is tried and tested and has proved to be an important tool in the good management of our prisons.  The rate of remission granted can be affected where a sanction involving loss of remission is imposed for specific breaches of prison discipline.  Notwithstanding that, even when a sanction of this nature is imposed, the period forfeited may be restored through subsequent good conduct.</P>
        <P>The following categories of prisoner are not eligible to earn remission of sentence:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Life sentence prisoners</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Persons convicted of debtor offences</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Persons convicted of contempt of court</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Persons being held on remand warrants</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Persons serving a sentence of less than one month.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Probation Service has a role in relation to offenders on supervised temporary release and other orders including those on post release supervision under the Sex Offender Act 2001, as well as offenders released on part suspended sentences under the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  There are also provisions under the Children Act for supervision following a period of detention.  The Probation Service works with offenders in custody who request assistance in their reintegration into society.  The purpose of intervention by the Probation Service is to address the issues that contribute to reoffending and assist the offender in reintegration.</P>
        <P>There are a number of specific legal and constitutional issues raised by the commitments in the Programme for Government. Matters to be explored will include whether changes to remission can be applied retrospectively where such application might have adverse implications on the liberty of the person in question.  There are rulings from the European Court of Human Rights that may be relevant in this context.  There are also issues as to whether rates of remission can be varied by reference to the nature of the offence, what type of conditions can be imposed on a person granted remission and the implications of linking remission solely to rehabilitation without reference to behaviour while in prison.  My Department is examining how best to implement the commitments in the Programme for Government with particular reference to any possible legislative amendments that might be required.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">As regards enhanced security, the Deputy will also be aware that in 2007 my predecessor secured sanction for an additional 155 staff to implement a range of security measures, coordinated nationally by a dedicated Governor, aimed at keeping contraband out of our prisons.  These measures include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of Operational Support Units in each prison dedicated to, and developing expertise in, searching and gathering intelligence; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the introduction of enhanced security screening and searching of all persons (visitors and staff) entering our prisons.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">With regard to demand elimination and treatment for prisoners with drug problems, the policy and strategy provides for a comprehensive range of treatment options.  Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  The programmes seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  Particular initiatives include, <i>inter alia</i>, the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, addiction counselling and drug therapy programmes.</P>
        <P>The strategy sees existing drug treatment programmes being expanded and enhanced with the further recruitment of nurses, psychologist and 24 dedicated addiction counsellors, as well as other staff including prison officers.  The expansion of these services is being achieved in partnership with community based services and will see a significant improvement in the range, quality and availability of drug treatment services in the prisons.</P><Col N="977"/>
        <P>The Prison Rules 2007, which took effect from 1 October 2007, include specific provision for mandatory drug testing.  Mandatory drug testing provides information on trends in drug misuse, enables the identification and referral of drug abusers to treatment programmes, enables enhanced focusing of resources and acts as a deterrent to drug misuse.  Mandatory drug testing will also serve to provide important information to prison management that will contribute significantly to decision-making in relation to the management of individual prisoners&rsquo; sentences.   Mandatory drug testing is currently in use in the Training Unit, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, Castlerea Prison, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey.  All prisoners must be drug free to attend an open centre and the intention is to roll out a programme of testing to the remaining institutions during 2008.</P>
        <P>For those prisoners who have given up drugs, and those who do not misuse drugs, the policy provides for the establishment of Voluntary Drug Testing Units within each closed prison.  This allows prisoners to reside in an environment that has enhanced supports to maintain their drug free status.  For many offenders, prison provides the first opportunity to escape from the cycle of drug abuse.  Drugs awareness courses and other interventions to highlight the detrimental effects of drug use and encourage prisoners to adopt or maintain a drug free lifestyle are also provided.</P>

	<P>Part 3 of the Prisons Act 2007, which came into operation on 1 October 2007, relates to prison discipline and provided a basis in primary legislation for revised disciplinary procedures applicable to prisoners, including access for prisoners to an independent appeals mechanism.  Section 12 provides for an inquiry to be held by a prison governor if a prisoner is alleged to have committed a breach of discipline and provides that the procedures for such an inquiry may be set out in prison rules.  The governor may impose a sanction and record the finding and the sanction, or record a finding that the allegation was not substantiated.  Section 13 lists the sanctions that may be imposed.</P><Col N="978"/>
        <P>Under section 14, a prisoner on whom a sanction is imposed may make a petition to the Minister on the finding or the sanction, and the Minister, following consultation with the governor, may affirm, alter, suspend or revoke the sanction imposed.  Section 15 introduces an independent appeals mechanism to review loss of remission for prisoners.  It provides that a prisoner against whom a penalty involving loss of remission has been imposed may make an appeal to an independent Appeal Tribunal.  This Appeals Tribunal was established by my predecessor in January of this year. The Tribunal may uphold or quash the original finding and may affirm, vary or quash the original sanction applied.  I wish to advise the Deputy that to date four prisoners have appealed disciplinary penalties which consist of or include loss of remission.  Arrangements are being made to hear the appeals in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, provides that a Court may make a Community Service Order as an alternative to a sentence of imprisonment or detention in respect of any individual <Col N="979"/>over the age of 16 years who has been convicted of a criminal offence and who consents to the Order being made.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Community Service Order requires an offender to perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours, usually to be completed within 12 months.  The aim of a Community Service Order is to rehabilitate the offender and make meaningful reparation to the community for his or her crime.  The Probation Service of my Department has responsibility for the supervision and management of Community Service Orders.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983 provides for the performance of between 40 and 240 hours of unpaid work in the community under the supervision of the Probation Service by a person who is 16 years or over, who has been convicted of an offence, for which the appropriate penalty would be an immediate custodial sentence and who has given his/her consent to the Court.  Community Service Orders have been available as a community sanction to Courts since 1985.</P>
        <P>In 2007 Courts in Ireland imposed 1519 Community Service Orders and offenders under the supervision of the Probation Service providing for 217,879 hours of unpaid community service work for their communities in lieu of prison sentences.  The range of work generally carried out by offenders on Community Service Orders, has included painting, decorating, landscaping, clearing/maintenance of community facilities (indoor and outdoor) restoration or enhancement of existing facilities such as community centres, youth clubs, grass cutting, cleaning graveyards and work with community groups in groups.</P>
        <P>The express purpose of Community Service is to provide benefit at no cost to communities, and indirectly to victims through the work of offenders as reparation. Community Service is widely recognised as a practical and visible embodiment of Restorative Justice principles and offender reparation, in particular.  Community Service projects are identified and established with the assistance and support of local community organisations and interests. There is ongoing communication and consultation by the Probation Service with local communities to maximise the benefits of Community Service.</P>
        <P>A key action within the current Probation Service Strategy and Workplan is to maximise the benefit of Community Service to local communities by reforming, revitalising and restructuring its delivery.  An independent review of the operation of Community Service is currently being completed by consultants to advise on the most appropriate model and structure of operation of Community Service.  Having regard to the commitment in the Programme for Government, I await the findings of that review which are due mid year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Children Act 2001, as amended, provides for a number of measures in relation to parental responsibility in respect of children involved in anti-social behaviour, and children found guilty of offences.  Section 111 of the Act provides that in any proceedings in which a child is found guilty of an offence, the court may make an order for the supervision of the child&rsquo;s parents where it is satisfied that a wilful failure of the child&rsquo;s parents to take care of or control the child contributed to the child&rsquo;s criminal behaviour.</P>
        <P>Section 113 of the Act provides that where a court is satisfied of the guilt of a child and that the appropriate way of dealing with the case is to make a compensation order, it may order that the compensation be paid by the parent or guardian of the child instead of the child.  Section 114 of the Act provides that a parent or guardian may be ordered by the court to enter into a recognisance to exercise proper and adequate control over their child.  If the child is found guilty of another offence as a result of said parent or guardian failing to exercise such control, the parent or guardian would forfeit the recognisance.</P>
        <P>It should be noted, however, that the imposition of any particular sanction referred to above on the parents or guardians of an offending child is a matter for the judiciary.  In addition, Part 13 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 introduced new measures with effect from 1st March 2007 to tackle anti-social behaviour of children through a civil process.  These measures provide that when a Garda becomes aware of anti-social behaviour, the Garda may issue a behaviour warning to the child.  Failure to obey the warning may result in a good behaviour contract being made involving the child, their parent(s) or guardian and the Garda&iacute;. If a contract is broken or if it is not working, it can be renewed or, an application can be made to the Children Court for a Civil Behaviour Order.  In addition to the Order, the court may also make a plan for the child to be supervised by their parents or guardian.</P>
        <P>Finally, the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010 which was published recently provides for the monitoring of the use of the anti-social behaviour measures in the Children Act.  This will be progressed during the term of the strategy.</P>

One of the priorities set for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2008 under section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 is to combat, particularly in cooperation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder with particular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour (including underage drinking) and socially disadvantaged communities especially through utilisation of the legal mechanisms being made available.  To this end An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are driving forward the establishment of interagency activities against anti-social behaviour, including the deployment of CCTV in urban <Col N="981"/>areas. In addition, they are identifying local public order and anti-social behaviour hot spots and developing actions and plans in response.</P>
        <P>The Agreed Programme for Government contains a range of commitments to combat anti-social behaviour.

        <P>Existing &lsquo;restriction on movement&rsquo;- type powers under Irish law largely arise in either the context of decisions to grant bail subject to certain conditions or at sentencing. In the latter case examples include exclusion orders under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003, the mandatory notification requirements imposed under the Sexual Offenders Act 2001 on persons convicted of sexual offences and the post-release supervision orders provided for in section 26 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007. Going beyond what is permitted by existing statutory provisions will give rise to consideration of highly sensitive issues, including ones of constitutional importance and will require careful scrutiny. In this regard I have, for example, the constitutional right to travel within and outside the State in mind. The examination of the commitment will take account of issues such as that.

	<P>The policing priorities for 2008 for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na include, &ldquo;To increase the level of high visibility patrols, including through greater use of marked vehicles, linked to the development during 2008 of a Garda Charter which will set out targeted response times and levels of service, including frequency of high visibility patrols.&rdquo;  This priority has been incorporated into the Annual Policing Plan for 2008 by the Garda Commissioner who has set a target for its development later this year.</P><Col N="984"/>
        <P>The Garda Inspectorate has been requested to examine the allocation of Garda resources and also to provide advice on the development of a Garda Charter as proposed in the Programme for Government and I look forward to receiving its advice.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has always been cognisant of its duty to provide a high quality service to the public.  It has currently in place a Garda Customer Charter and a Declaration of Ethical and Professional Standards, and it is developing a Customer Relationship Model for all its customers.  I aim to build on the excellent record of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard through the development of a Charter which will ensure that Garda resources are targeted where they can have most effect and can respond rapidly and effectively to the needs of communities in all parts of the country.</P>

	<P>As at 30th April 2008 there were 51 Reserve trainees and 261 attested Reserve Garda&iacute;.  The Agreed Programme for Government has set a target strength for the Reserve at 10% of the strength of full-time members of the force.  Garda Reserve members undertake their training and other duties on a voluntary basis during their free time. As a result it is not possible to predict how many people will commence training in any particular period.  In the Annual Policing Plan for 2008 the Garda Commissioner has set a target of recruiting 270 members this year.  The next class of Reserve trainees will commence training on the 7th of June.</P>
        <P>Recruitment is continuing and regular promotional efforts to attract potential Reserve members are being undertaken.  In February and March 2007, the Garda Commissioner appointed a Chief Superintendent and Superintendent to co-ordinate the management and marketing of the Garda Reserve.  There is an on-going marketing campaign to recruit members to the Garda Reserve.  This is achieved through local media interviews, radio advertisements, cinema advertisements, DART advertisements and Dublin Bus advertisements.  There were <Col N="985"/>also stands taken at the Ploughing Championships, the Young Scientist of the Year Awards and F&Aacute;S Opportunities in Croke Park.</P>
        <P>There was a feature on the Garda Reserve on the RTE Crime Call programme.  A promotional DVD was commissioned and forwarded to all second level schools in the country.  This DVD was transmitted on the City Channel for three months.  Promotional material on the Garda Reserve has been forwarded to each District Officer in the country to be disseminated to post offices, libraries, leisure centres, shopping centres, banks and credit unions in their District, as well as to local residents associations, neighbourhood watch groups and community alert groups.  I cannot predict exactly when the full complement of Garda Reserve members will be reached but I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have advised me that they are making every effort to reach it and they have my total support in that objective.</P>

	<P>Section 56 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 governs the circumstances in which a copy of the recording of interviews conducted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may be given to an accused. Specifically the section provides that only a person charged with an offence before a court, or his or her legal representative, may be given at a copy of any recording of the questioning of the person while he or she was detained. The decision is a matter for the court and it may be subject to such conditions (if any) as the court may specify. A breach of the court order is punishable as a contempt of court.</P>
        <P>This section repeals provisions in the Criminal Justice, Act 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations, 1997 which provided that a copy of the recording be provided by the Superintendent, subject to certain exceptions, to the person interviewed or his/her legal representative on receipt of a written request irrespective of whether the person was charged with an offence. Section 56 creates a more restrictive framework while at the same time ensuring the accused&rsquo;s right to due process.</P>

Recently the Inspectorate published a progress report on the implementation of the recommendations contained in their report and I am informed by the Garda Authorities that of the total of eighty-five recommendations contained in the report, thirty-four have been fully implemented with a further forty-one recom<Col N="986"/>mendations currently underway with a targeted date for implementation by the end of 2008.  The remaining nine recommendations, which were accepted by the Commissioner with some modifications, are planned for implementation in 2009.</P>
        <P>In relation to gun licensing law, the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which was signed into law on 16 July 2006, provides for significant amendments to the Firearms Acts 1925-2000 and substantially reforms the law in relation to legally and illegally held firearms.  The vast majority of the recommendations proposed for gun licensing have been legislated for in this Act.  The Firearms Consultative Panel, which was set up in 2007 to assist with the introduction of the firearms licensing regime, is currently working on the outstanding issues.  The Panel comprises organisations representing the different shooting interest groups, firearms dealers representatives, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, officials of my Department and other relevant Departments.</P>

	<P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently delivers both Primary and Secondary School Programmes throughout the country which include a focus on drugs education.  The Garda Secondary School Programme has been designed in conjunction with the Social Personal &amp; Health Education (SPHE) syllabus of the Department of Education &amp; Science.  This SPHE syllabus supports the personal development, health and well being of young people and helps them to create and maintain supportive relationships.

	<P>In relation to the issue of the Criminal Asset Bureau&rsquo;s work at regional and local levels, I can inform the Deputy that in order to maximise the benefit that can be derived from local knowledge, officers from the Criminal Assets Bureau work closely with Gardai from specific regions and localities in order to ensure that the efforts of the Bureau are targeted in the most effective manner possible.  As you may also know, my colleague and predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Brian Lenihan T.D. , has also already included in the Government&rsquo;s policing priorities for 2008 for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a specific reference to enhanced liaison arrangements between Garda Divisions and the Criminal Assets Bureau in the pursuit of those engaged in drug dealing at all levels.</P>
        <P>The Bureau will continue to utilise the services of Divisional Criminal Assets Profilers throughout the country and profilers are now in place in all Garda Divisions across the country.  At present eighty one Garda divisional profilers have been appointed and are operational and the complement of Divisional profilers will continue to be monitored and reviewed on an on-going basis.  In addition, eleven officials from the Revenue Commissioners have been trained as asset profilers.  The use of local Garda officers in this way ensures that preparatory groundwork can be carried out in advance of a full investigation by the Bureau. Asset profilers have at all times recourse to the expertise and advice of the Bureau.  Essentially a key function of these profilers is to ascertain and build up information at local levels and point out individuals at whom the Bureau&rsquo;s work can be targeted. Such information is then investigated and followed up further by the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>

        <P>In this regard, the Criminal Assets Bureau is being actively utilised to identify and target assets accumulated by crime gangs, in order to seize such assets and to deprive criminals of the profits of their illegal activities. The measures which the Criminal Assets Bureau continues to take against crime groups involves the restraint and seizure of assets by way of the Proceeds of Crime legislation, the raising of tax assessments and the collection of money under revenue legislation and through the implementation of actions as deemed appropriate under Social Welfare legislation. This work continues to cause major disruption to these crime groups by removing the profit generated by their criminal activities and such action will continue to be vigorously pursued by the Bureau. My Department will continue to consider how to advance additional measures, such as the use of divestitures and trusteeships, designed to assist in the fight against organised crime.</P>

	<P>The Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a Judicial Sentencing Commission.  This matter is being considered in the context of the Judicial Council Bill under preparation.  I <Col N="989"/>stress, however, the independence, within the law, of the Judiciary and each member of the Judiciary in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of the judicial function.  In considering this matter, my Department is guided by the ongoing work of the steering committee established by the Courts Service Board to plan for and provide information on sentencing.  The committee, under the chair of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court, comprises a judge from the High, Circuit and District Courts and a university law lecturer with expertise in sentencing law.</P>
        <P>The project, known as the Irish Sentencing Information System, involves an examination of the feasibility of providing a computerised information system on sentences and other penalties imposed for criminal offences.  This will assist judges when considering the sentence to be imposed in an individual case.  The objective of a sentencing information system is to enable a judge, by entering relevant criteria, to access information about the range of sentences and other penalties imposed for particular types of offence in previous cases.  The Committee established a pilot project in June 2006 in Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.  A further pilot commenced in Cork Circuit Court in April 2008.  An appropriate IT system has been developed incorporating a database where the information collected is electronically stored for subsequent retrieval and searching.</P>

	<P>Section 27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, as amended by the Criminal Justice Acts 1999 and 2006, provides for mandatory minimum sentence of not less than 10 years of imprisonment for individuals convicted of a first offence under section 15A &mdash; possession of drugs with a value of at least &euro;13,000 for sale or supply &mdash; or 15B &mdash; importation of drugs with a value of at least &euro;13,000 &mdash; of that Act.  The mandatory minimum sentence, or to give it its more correct name, presumptive minimum sentence, is to be imposed in all cases save for those with very specific and exceptional mitigating factors.  Where an individual is convicted of a second or subsequent office under sections 15A and/or 15B a court has no discretion and must always impose a sentence of not less than the mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years.  The maximum sentence available for section 15A and 15B offences is life imprisonment.</P>
        <P>Having regard to concern about the degree to which the presumptive minimum sentence was being imposed, notwithstanding the amendments introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, section 33 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 further amended section 27 of the 1977 Act to insert an interpretation clause.  The clause emphasises that a decision to depart from the presumptive minimum sentence must be based on the presence of individual and extraordinary reasons as to why the interest of justice would not be served by imposition of a sentence of not less than 10 years.  Referring to the damaging effects of drug related crime on Irish society the clause states that a court must, as a general principle, always impose the mandatory minimum sentence on persons convicted of an offence under sections 15A and 15B.</P>
        <P>The Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to conduct a formal annual review of the effect of these provisions concerning the mandatory sentence regime for drug crime which were introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  As the provisions in question <Col N="990"/>which are contained in Section 33 of the Act were commenced with effect from 18 May 2007, they have only been in operation for just approximately one year to date.  Therefore, the issue of establishing a formal review mechanism will be addressed at the appropriate stage.</P>

	<P>New and stringent provisions in relation to bail were introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  These included a requirement that applicants for bail may have to provide a statement of their means, their previous criminal record and details of any offences committed while previously on bail.  The Act also provides that a Garda Superintendent may give an opinion that bail should be refused on the grounds that the applicant is likely to commit a serious offence if granted bail.  The prosecution authorities were also given the right to appeal against decisions to grant bail or, where it is granted, the conditions attaching to it.  The Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to conduct a formal annual review of the new measures in relation to bail introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  As the Deputy is aware, the provisions in question have been in operation for less than a year.  The issue of establishing a formal review mechanism will be addressed at the appropriate stage.</P>

	<P>The commitments in the Programme for Government 2007-12 to which the question refers are under consideration.  The question of giving the DPP the power to seek a review of unduly lenient sentences handed down in the District Court was examined by the Law Reform Commission in its report on prosecution appeals and pre-trial hearings (LRC 81-2006).  The LRC decided that in principle such sentences should be subject to review.  However, the LRC felt that more information was required on sentencing practices in the District Court before giving the DPP such a power.  This information deficit is being addressed by the steering committee established by the Courts Service Board to plan for and provide information on sentencing.</P>
        <P>The committee, under the chair of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court has initiated a project, known as the Irish Sentencing Information System.  The project involves an examination of the feasibility of providing a computerised information system on sentences and other penalties imposed for criminal offences.  This will assist judges when considering the sentence to be imposed in an individual case.  The objective of a sentencing information system is to enable a judge, by entering relevant criteria, to access information about the range of sentences and other penalties imposed for particular types of offence in previous cases.  The Committee established a pilot project in June 2006 in Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.  A further pilot commenced in Cork Circuit Court last month.  An appropriate IT system has been <Col N="991"/>developed incorporating a database where the information collected is electronically stored for subsequent retrieval and searching.  It is expected that the outcome of this initiative will prepare the ground for the implementation of this commitment in the Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The issue of prosecution submissions at the sentencing stage was examined by the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group.  At present there is no statute regulating the right of the prosecution to make such submissions.  The Deputy will be aware that the DPP&rsquo;s Guidelines for Prosecutors give some direction in this regard, as do the codes of conduct of the Bar and the Law Society.  In light of its deliberations the Group recommended that the DPP guidelines be amended to permit the prosecution to assist the sentencing judge by volunteering information on sentencing precedents irrespective of whether such detail was or was not solicited by the Court.</P>
        <P>The Group further recommended that my Department, together with the Office of the DPP, keep under review the possibility of allowing the prosecutor to volunteer precedents and to make submissions at the outset of the sentencing stage and to make submissions to the court as to the aggravating factors, but without recommending a particular sentence range.  The recommendations made by the Review Group are being examined by my Department.  In the course of that review, the views of the Office of the Attorney General and of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions will be sought.  I am not in a position at this stage to say when the review will be completed.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 497 to 499, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s Questions refer to Government commitments regarding the conduct of and procedures relating to criminal trials.  The issues raised by these commitments were considered by the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group, chaired by Dr. Gerard Hogan SC, which reported in March 2007 to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In considering the disposal of admissibility issues pre-trial, the Review Group recommended that legislation be introduced to provide that admissibility issues may be determined prior to the swearing in of a jury on the first day of the trial.  The Group considered that the present arrangement <Col N="992"/>whereby a jury is sworn in before any admissibility issue is determined is illogical and inconvenient on a number of levels and is based on historical considerations which no longer apply.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that a considerable disparity exists between the advance disclosure obligations of the defence and prosecution counsel in criminal cases.  The prosecution is required to set out the precise details of the case they will seek to present and the conclusions which it will attempt to prove.  The defence, in contrast, is not required to furnish any such information, with certain exceptions such as alibi evidence under Section 20 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, witness information required under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and evidence regarding the mental state of the accused under Section 19 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  The Review Group considered a range of options regarding defence statements, including models based on UK law.  The Group concluded that, having regard to the difficulties of moving to a defence statement regime, the obligation on additional disclosure should be limited to expert and technical reports and witness statements of experts on which the defendant intends to rely.</P>
        <P>The Government commitment to introduce measures to ensure that criminal trials can no longer be collapsed encompasses the majority recommendation of the Review Group concerning the exclusionary rule of evidence.  The majority of the Group recommended that the strict exclusionary rule as articulated by the Supreme Court in 1990 in DPP <i>v</i>. Kenny should be recalibrated so that the court would have the discretion to admit unconstitutionally obtained evidence or not, having regard to the totality of the circumstances and in particular the rights of victims.  The majority suggested, in the first instance, the approach of seeing whether a change in jurisprudence emerges following use of the more extensive opportunities for prosecution right of appeal which was provided by means of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  If such an approach does not bear fruit, the majority suggested various legislative options or possibly constitutional change.  The majority recognised the legislative options examined would give rise to important constitutional issues.  The Chair of the Group submitted a minority report.  In it, he argues that change is unnecessary and, perhaps, undesirable.</P>
        <P>In my view, the procedures mentioned by the Deputy are important and could have a significant impact on the conduct of criminal trials.  As with all long established procedures relating to the criminal law, it is important that we consider the issues and implications very carefully before undertaking radical changes.  However, that is not to say we should shy away from change where it is necessary.  These matters are being examined in my Department at present in the context of the commitments made in the Programme for Government. We are fortunate in having the considered opinions of the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group on the issues as a starting point for the examination.</P>
        <P>The recommendations made by the Review Group are being examined by my Department.  In the course of that examination, the views of the Office of the Attorney General and of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions will be sought.  I am not in a position at this stage to say when the examination will be completed.</P>

	<P>The current procedure used by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which was introduced following advice from the Law Officers, involves each participant in an identity parade being assigned a number.  To ensure there is no doubt as to the person the victim or witness has identified, it is necessary that a clear identification is made.  This may be done in a number of ways, including pointing at or stating the position or number of a person on the line-up.  Prior to this the procedure necessitated the witness or victim placing their hand on the person as part of the identification process.  The installation of one-way mirrors in Garda stations for identification parades including the practical issues such as suitable locations within stations is being examined by the Garda authorities.</P>

	<P>The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the Judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal representation him/herself.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &ldquo;gravity of the charge&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the Judiciary.</P>
        <P>The current position is that, under the Act, an applicant for free legal aid may be required by the court to complete a statement of means.  It is an offence for an applicant to knowingly make a false statement or conceal a material fact for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.  My Department, in consultation with the Courts Service, is carrying out a review of the operation of this aspect of the Scheme in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling domestic violence was reflected in the establishment in June 2007 of Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  Cosc&rsquo;s key responsibility is to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Cosc&rsquo;s major priority is to produce a National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence which has the support of State and non-government organisations in the sector.

	<P>Following a Government Decision, Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence was set up in June 2007 with the key responsibility is to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  As part of its remit, Cosc facilitates the development of strategies and services in relation to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in line with best international practice.  This involves mapping current service standards as well as sourcing, disseminating and, in due course, facilitating the implementation of best practice in relation to the services.</P>
        <P>With the aim of progressing its interagency work on health and housing issues, Cosc has established a committee which comprises senior representatives from Cosc, the Health Service Executive and the Departments of Health and Children and Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The involvement of these organisations is important as the provision of refuge accommodation can be funded through the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government&rsquo;s voluntary housing programme while the Health Service Executive provides funding for the staffing of the refuges.  The committee has agreed that the first steps in addressing the adequacy of safe accommodation provision is to conduct an assessment of the current system and to develop a needs assessment system informed by the National Housing Policy and policy to be included in the National Strategy on Domestic and Sexual Violence.  The outcomes of this assessment and consultation work will inform decisions on any increase in the number of refuge spaces.</P>

They receive this in two modules, namely Social and Psychological studies and Legal and Policing studies.  Additional training is provided as part of the Continuous Professional Development programmes and a dedicated training programme is provided for those selected for the Detective Branch.  Continuous Professional Development incorporated domestic violence in the 1997 Core Programme for all members of Garda and Sergeant rank after the Domestic Violence Act came into force in 1996.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, a policy document was issued to all members.

The situation is kept under constant review by Continuous Professional Development.  A Specialist Child Interviewer Course has been developed and 21 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have successfully passed the course to date.  This intensive course trains the participants to interview children under 14 and persons with an intellectual disability.  There is a Garda Inspector in each Garda Division nominated to monitor all incidents of domestic <Col N="996"/>violence within the Division and to ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigating such incidents adhere to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policy on domestic violence.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 508 and 513 together.</P>
        <P>There are a range of mechanisms in place for the assessment and monitoring of this group of offenders.  The Sex Offenders Act 2001 which commenced on 27 September 2001, makes provision, under Part 5, for the Courts to impose a post release supervision Order which obliges the convicted person to undergo supervision by the Probation Service for a specified period and to comply with such conditions as are specified therein.  Offenders who are subject to a post release supervision Order are managed on a one-to-one basis by a Probation Officer.  If a sex offender fails to comply with obligations as outlined in the Act, the offender is guilty of an offence and subject to a fine and / or imprisonment.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the Court in its deliberations to decide whether or not to impose a post release supervision order.  There is also a system in place whereby Child Care Managers in the Health Service Executive are informed, by the Senior Probation Officer, of the impending release of sex offenders from prisons irrespective of whether the offence is against a child or adult.   The Child Care Manager is provided with the date of release, details of the offence committed and address of the offender following release.</P>
        <P>Section 9 of the 2001 Act places an obligation on Prison Governors to inform the garda&iacute; of the impending release of a sex offender, at least 10 days in advance, and to remind the offender of his or her obligations under the legislation prior to release.  In addition to offenders approaching release, offenders who are going to Court where there is a possibility of early release (i.e. a review of sentence or an appeal of length of sentence) must also be informed of their obligations before they attend Court.  Furthermore, a convicted sex offender must notify his/her name(s), date of birth and current home address to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within seven days of the conviction for the sexual offence concerned or, where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of full release from prison.  The offender must also notify the garda&iacute; of a change of name or address within seven days of that change.  Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any 12-month period must also be given to the garda&iacute;.  If the offender intends to leave the State for a period of seven days or more s/he must inform the garda&iacute; of this fact and the address at which s/he intends to stay and also notify the Garda&iacute; of his/her return.</P><Col N="997"/>
        <P>The provisions of the Act extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries or who have been convicted abroad of an offence comparable to one covered by the Act.  It is an offence under Part 4 of the Act for convicted sex offenders to apply for, or to accept, work or to offer services, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of unsupervised access to, or contact with, children or mentally impaired persons, without informing the employer or organisation of his/her conviction for a qualifying sexual offence.  It is an offence to fail to comply with the notification requirements.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has in place a system for the monitoring of persons subject to aforementioned requirements.</P>
        <P>In September 2007, following a review and restructuring exercise, the Probation Service established a division to manage the rehabilitation of high risk offenders from prison to the community, on a national basis.  This followed from the allocation of additional resources to the Probation Service, on foot of a Government Decision of 18 April 2007 which approved an additional 71 professional and administrative posts for the Service.  The division consists of seven teams who deliver services to the main prisons for sentenced prisoners.  This dedicated division provides pre-sanction Reports to the Central Criminal Court, co-manages the Sex Offender Programme in Arbour Hill Prison with the Psychology Service of the Irish Prison Service, and co-delivers the Probation funded community based treatment programmes in conjunction with the Granada Institute known as the Lighthouse project.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, to enhance effective practice, the Probation Service is committed to the introduction of an all-Ireland sex offender risk assessment instrument which will enhance the assessment of sex offenders in prisons and in the community.  In turn, such assessments will facilitate an ability to target resources at those offenders who are categorised as posing a greater risk of re-offending and a risk to public safety.  In addition, linkages at a central level have been developed with the Irish Prison Service and the Garda.  Joint training in sex offender assessment between the Probation Service and the Garda will commence in June of this year.</P>
        <P>Linkages with the Probation Board of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Sex Offender Strategic Management committee have been increasing.  Contact has also been established with the Scottish Executive through Probation Officers attending training programmes at their invitation.  In addition, as part of the Homeless Agency structures in Dublin, the Probation Service chairs a multi-agency committee on homeless sex offenders.  The committee has representation from the four local authorities, HSE, justice and voluntary sectors.  My Department, through the Probation Service, has committed &euro;200,000 over two years to recruit a co-ordinator to increase the extent and effectiveness of cross-agency working in this area.  I will keep developments under constant review.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children is presently examining the Bill amending the Constitution published last year and expects to report to the Oireachtas by the end of November.  This deals, <i>inter alia</i>, with important matters that arose from the decision of the Supreme Court in the C.C. case and it is likely that further legislation will be necessary to give effect to the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  As soon as those two pieces of legislation are enacted, we will have a modern set of criminal laws governing sexual offences.  However, it is only at that point that the question of consolidation will arise.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 567 of 17 April 2008. The position in relation to long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</P>
        <P>While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  I have been informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that an application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received on 12 June 2007.  I understand that applications received in August 2006 are currently being dealt with and that as soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</P>
        <P>The person in question also made an application for Business Permission in the State which was refused in August 2007. There is currently an appeal pending in relation to this refusal and a decision should issue shortly.  If the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question wishes to leave the State for medical attention, he may do so, and if he wishes to return at a future date he should apply to the nearest Irish Embassy for the appropriate visa to re-enter the State.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Questions No. 220 of Thursday 3 April 2008, No. 391 Tuesday 22 April 2008 and the written Replies to those Questions.  The first named person concerned arrived in the State on 15 December 2002, accompanied by two of her children, and made an application for asylum.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P><Col N="1004"/>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the first named person was informed, by letter dated 28 April 2004, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of her and her children.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of deportation orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her children should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the first named person concerned and her two children.</P>
        <P>Additionally, the first named person concerned has recently submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). When consideration of this application has been completed, the first named person concerned will be notified, in writing, of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the first named person, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the first named person is passed to me for decision.</P>
        <P>The second named person referred to by the Deputy applied for Asylum on 24 October 2006. The claim was assessed by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the second named person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. The Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation was communicated to him by letter dated 15 November 2006. This communication advised the person of his entitlement to appeal the Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which he duly did.  The Refugee Appeals Tribunal considered the second named person&rsquo;s appeal, following which the Tribunal affirmed the Commissioner&rsquo;s earlier recommendation to reject his claim. The outcome of the appeal was made known to the applicant by letter dated 12 May 2008.</P>
        <P>In accordance with normal procedures, the applicant&rsquo;s file will be forwarded to my Department&rsquo;s Ministerial Decisions Unit for final processing of the Asylum claim. A letter will issue to him from my Department advising him formally that his  asylum claim had been rejected and affording him three options as follows: 1. Return home voluntarily; 2. Consent to the making of a deportation order, or; 3. Make written representations to me within 15 working days for temporary leave to remain in the State and/or make an application for subsidiary protection under the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (SI No. 518 of 2006).</P>

	<P>Since the Deputy has not provided details of a particular case, I can only set out the position generally.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. These conditions are that the applicant must: be of full age, or by way of exception, be a minor born in the State; be of good character; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P>Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that I may, in my absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.  If the Deputy wishes to furnish further particulars, officials in the Citizenship Section of my Department will advise him of the position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Immigration Act 2003, which was commenced on the 15th September 2003, contained a number of key changes to the Refugee Act, 1996 which enabled the processing of asylum applications to be speeded up and enhanced our ability to deal with abusive applications. These changes included the imposition on applicants of a clear statutory duty to actively pursue their asylum applications and co-operate at all times with the processing agencies or face having their applications deemed withdrawn.</P>
        <P>The most common reasons for an application to be deemed withdrawn are where an applicant fails to attend for an interview at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) without reasonable cause; an applicant fails to co-operate with the Refugee Applications Commissioner after having lodged his or her application; or an applicant fails to notify the Commissioner of his or her postal address or change of address.</P>
        <P>Since the commencement of the Immigration Act, 2003 recommendations are made by the ORAC to the Minister that an application should be deemed withdrawn.  Statistics are not maintained in a way which distinguishes between applications deemed withdrawn on the basis of applicants failing to notify the Refugee Applications Commissioner of their postal address or change of address and applications deemed withdrawn for other reasons.  The number of <Col N="1006"/>asylum applications deemed to be withdrawn in the period from 2000 to end of April 2008 are set out in the following tabular format (asylum applications deemed to be withdrawn where the application was transferred to another Dublin Convention country are provided separately).</P>

        <P FLI="0">Section 13(2) of the Refugee Act (as amended) provides that there is no right of appeal against a recommendation to deem an application withdrawn.  Where an asylum application is deemed to be withdrawn the applicant is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(a) of the Immigration Act, 1999. A person served with a notice of intent to deport is afforded certain options, viz. to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a Deportation Order; to make an application for subsidiary protection; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and why temporary leave to remain in the State be granted instead.</P>
        <P>In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended. Temporary leave to remain is considered in every case regardless of whether representations are made by, or on behalf of, the persons concerned.  Statistics are not maintained in a way which distinguishes between deportations effected arising from applications deemed to be withdrawn and other deportations.

	<P>Apartment living involves a high level of interdependence between residents and this is frequently reflected in the fact that the leases for such accommodation contain conditions or covenants which are designed to maintain the exterior of the building while minimising internal noise and nuisance levels for the benefit of residents. Such conditions may, for example, regulate the uses to which balcony space may be put, the keeping of pets or the installation of wooden floors. These covenants form part of the contractual arrangements entered into by residents themselves and are essentially a matter for the parties concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The compilation and publication of crime statistics is now the responsibility of the Central Statistics Office (CSO). This decision was taken following the submission of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics related to juvenile crime directly to the Deputy.  Statistics in regard to the number of children referred to the Garda Diversion Programme have been provided by the Garda Commissioner and are as follows in each year since 2004: 2004 &mdash; 17,656; 2005 &mdash; 17,567; 2006 &mdash; 20,016; 2007 &mdash; 21,941; 2008 to date &mdash; no figures available for this period.</P>
        <P>Diversion of young people from crime and the criminal justice system is one of the key responsibilities of my Department in accordance with the provisions of the Children Act 2001, as amended.  The causes of delinquent, anti-social, and criminal behaviour are often complex and may cover a range of issues which are dealt with by a number of Government Departments. In my own Department, for example, the Government has put in place a comprehensive programme to implement youth justice reforms including the establishment of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS).  In March of this year, the National Youth Justice Strategy was published.</P>
        <P>In developing the strategy the IYJS and other agencies agreed a number of goals and actions needed to achieve these goals over the next three years. It provides for a coordinated approach across agencies. The success of the strategy is dependent on the commitment and work of not only the IYJS, but also of other agencies working together in order to deliver services effectively to young people in trouble with the law. The focus is on diverting children from crime and the criminal justice system, promoting restorative justice, enforcing community sanctions, facilitating rehabilitation and, as a last resort, providing for detention.</P>
        <P>The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme which the Deputy refers to is an initiative first introduced in 1963 to provide an opportunity to divert juvenile offenders from criminal activity. It has proven to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. It also enables referral to the Garda Youth Diversion Projects which are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives <Col N="1009"/>operating separately from the Programme and which aim to divert young people away from crime and anti-social behaviour.  There are currently 100 of these type of projects operating throughout the country and this number will be extended to 168 in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government.</P>

	<P>With regard to proposed legislation, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008, which is currently at Committee Stage in the House.   Section 36 of the Bill contains proposals for the Introduction of a statutory long-term resident status based on a number of standard eligibility requirements including a requirement that the applicant have at least five years satisfactory residence in the State.  Applications in relation to the current administrative scheme for long term residency are considered in respect of persons who have resided legally in Ireland for a period of time in excess of 60 months on the basis of a Work Permit, Work Authorisation or Working Visa.  In calculating the reckonable period of 60 months residence, consideration is given only to time spent in the State legally on work permit conditions.  Short absences from the country, such as for holidays or business travel, would not prejudice an application.</P>
        <P>With regard to naturalisation, section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, requires that an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation has had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years. Applicants must also intend to have their usual or principal place of residence in the State after naturalisation.</P>
        <P>Should the applicant fulfil the aforementioned criteria, his / her application will move to be processed. During the processing stage, while it may not be deemed prejudicial to the application should the applicant wish to leave the State for short periods, each case is considered individually. In circumstances where the person in question does wish to leave the State while his / her application is being processed, he / she should notify the Citizenship section of my Department of the dates of travel and the reasons for same.</P>

A further application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department in March 2008.  The application has not been examined in detail.

	<P>The Sex Offenders Act, 2001 was enacted on 30 June, 2001 and contains a comprehensive series of provisions aimed at protecting children and other vulnerable persons against sexual abuse and attack.  The Act came into operation on 27 September, 2001.  The Act sets out the obligations on persons convicted of a range of sexual offences, making them subject to notification requirements under Part 2 of the Act.  The provisions of the Act also extend to any sex offenders who enter the State.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has in place a system for the monitoring of persons subject to these requirements.  The Domestic Violence and sexual Assault Unit monitor and manage the notification provisions.</P>
        <P>There are nominated Garda Inspectors in each Garda Division who have responsibility for the monitoring of persons subject to the requirements of the Act in their Division.  As soon as the Domestic Violence and Assault Investigation Unit is advised by a relevant authority, such as the Irish Prison Service, the Courts Service or a foreign law enforcement agency, of the impending release or movement of sex offenders into their area this information is immediately passed to the nominated Inspectors, who are advised of information relevant to their Division.  Should they arise, child protection issues are raised with the health authorities, as set out in the Children First guidelines.</P>
        <P>A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to ensure that information on sex offenders who plan to travel between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland, is shared by the relevant police forces was signed on 26 November, 2006.  There is ongoing contact between my Department and the Northern Ireland Office in the context of ensuring that registered sex offenders in both jurisdictions do not exploit differences in the legislative provisions and so evade the law.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Sex Offenders Act are kept under constant review with a view to ensuring the Act is operating in an efficient and effective manner.  I am preparing a Sexual Offences Bill in which it is proposed to amend certain provisions of the Act, including those concerning the notification requirements placed on convicted sex offenders.  At present a convicted sex offender is allowed seven days to notify the Garda&iacute; of his or her name and address.  It is intended that this will be reduced to three days and so bring the law in this respect into line with that in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.  Provision is also being made for annual notification, even where offenders have not changed their name or address.</P>
        <P>In addition, provision is being made that when an offender notifies his or her name and address to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is the name and address on the date of notification that must be provided and not, for example, the address at the date of conviction, which might be different.  It is intended also that offenders will be obliged to register in person at the Garda divisional or district headquarters for the area in which they reside.  Previously, offenders could notify Garda&iacute; at any divisional or district headquarters.  An additional requirement will also be placed <Col N="1011"/>on offenders convicted abroad whereby they will have to provide their address where they usually reside in their home country.</P>

In addition, the person concerned was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and, following consideration of this application, it was determined that the person concerned was not eligible for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 25 April 2008.  The case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will now be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned will be passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>Housing policy and support, as set out in the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, is designed to reflect the needs of our growing and diverse population and to target supports at the particular needs of people in different phases of their life.</P>
        <P>Supported by an unprecedented &euro;18 billion investment in housing programmes provided for under the National Development Plan, 2007-2013, my Department&rsquo;s social housing investment programme is focused on meeting the needs of individual residents by providing them with homes for life in safe and well planned neighbourhoods.  The Government has undertaken a broad range of actions as part of a strategic response to enhance the range of housing supports and services available to older people.  These actions range from the introduction of better-targeted financial supports to the development of inter-agency protocols to ensure coordinated service delivery at local level where there is a care dimension in association with meeting housing need.</P>
        <P>Apart from the provision of retirement-type accommodation by the private sector, the specific accommodation needs of older people can be directly met through a wide range of available supports including grant schemes which allow people to remain in their own homes to the provision of specific accommodation through local authority housing and voluntary and cooperative housing. In the context of Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, my Department continues to keep the matter of financial contribution schemes, whereby private housing is part-exchanged for social rented accommodation appropriate for older people, under review.</P>
        <P>The provision of accommodation by approved voluntary and co-operative housing bodies is an integral part of the Department&rsquo;s overall response to delivering on housing need for older <Col N="1016"/>people. Under the Capital Assistance Scheme, funding of up to 100% of the approved cost is available for the provision of permanent accommodation for groups with special housing needs, including the elderly. This year the allocation for the scheme is being increased from &euro;113m in 2007 to a record &euro;130m. Approved housing bodies which provide sheltered housing under the scheme, normally provide on-site support for the tenants where necessary. However, where a higher level of support is needed, this may be done with assistance from the Health Service Executive. The HSE introduced a scheme of dedicated funding for sheltered housing in 2006 with funding of &euro;0.5m in 2006 and 2007. This was increased to &euro;1.1m in 2008.</P>
        <P>In line with the commitments set out in the housing policy statement and the partnership agreement, Towards 2016, a cross-departmental team on sheltered housing, chaired by my Department, was established last year to develop and oversee policy in this area and to agree, as a priority, local structures and protocols for integrated management and delivery of housing and related care services. The work of this group will ultimately feed into the new National Positive Ageing Strategy, outlined in the Programme for Government.</P>

	<P>As indicated in the reply to Question Nos 197 and 198 of 27 September 2007, the non-completion of any development in line with the planning permission for that development is unauthorised development, which is an offence under the Planning Acts.  Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authorities, which have substantial enforcement powers and duties under the Planning Acts.</P>
        <P>The power to refuse planning permission to a developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission was introduced under the Planning and Development Act 2000. This provision was further strengthened under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, to allow planning authorities refuse planning permission in such circumstances, without recourse to the High Court, effectively reversing the burden of proof in such cases.</P>
        <P>The use of these powers, and the enforcement of planning control across the range of provisions for enforcement action in cases of breaches of the planning code, is a matter for each planning authority. My Department does not, therefore, hold information on the extent to which the new powers are being applied by planning authorities.  However, data on local authority performance on planning enforcement more generally are included in the publication Service Indicators in Local Authorities produced annually by the Local Government Management Services Board and available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

        <P>The NDP provides the resources &mdash; some &euro;18 billion in total &mdash; which will support increased output from social and affordable housing measures and result in the needs of some 140,000 new households being met in this period.  This level of provision has enabled significant progress to be made on the expanded delivery of social and affordable housing programmes with over 13,000 housing units provided through these measures last year by local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.

	<P>Homelessness involves a complex interplay between personal, economic, social and structural factors.  Significant progress has been undertaken to address this issue since the adoption of the Integrated Government Strategy on Homelessness in 2000.  This has resulted in an improvement in both the quality and range of services for homeless persons.  Homeless fora have been established throughout the country and local action plans on homelessness adopted.  A range of new services, in relation to emergency, transitional and long-term accommodation has been provided and settlement services have been developed to assist people out of homelessness.   </P>
        <P>In order to ensure a &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; approach to the issue of homelessness, the Government established a Cross Department Team on Homelessness.  The Team works to ensure an integrated response to the many issues which affect homeless people, including emergency, transitional and long-term responses as well as issues relating to health, education, employment and home-making.  The integrated work of this team, complemented by integration at local level achieved by local homeless fora, reflects the Government&rsquo;s recognition that the response to homelessness must involve not just the provision of housing or shelter, but that a comprehensive approach is needed involving health, care and welfare, education, training and support, as well as accommodation, to enable homeless persons to re-integrate into society and to prevent others from becoming homeless.</P>
        <P>Regarding the trend in homelessness, progress is reflected in the most recently published national figures for homelessness, which showed a total of 2,399 homeless households in the country at March 2005, a decrease compared to 2,468 households at March 2002.  The 2005 figures comprised 3,031 individuals, a significant reduction from 5,581 persons in 2002.  A count has taken place in March 2008 and indicative results are expected later this year.</P>
        <P>A revised Government Strategy on Homelessness is being developed by my Department, under the aegis of the Cross Department Team on Homelessness with input from the National Homeless Consultative Committee, which includes representatives of local authorities, the HSE and voluntary bodies.  I anticipate that the strategy will be submitted to Government shortly.  The strategy aims to eliminate long term occupation of emergency homeless accommodation and the need to sleep rough, by 2010 and also addresses the prevention of homelessness, where possible.  This builds on the commitments in both the Programme for Government and in Towards 2016.</P>

	<P>My Department, through its various mechanisms of policy, legislation and guidance, places priority attention on the promotion of quality in the built environment. Building quality housing is at the core of the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, which sets out a vision to guide the transformation of the Irish housing sector over the next ten years. Since its publication in February 2007, the reform agenda put forward in the statement has been actively pursued and a number of initiatives have already been undertaken.</P>
        <P>My Department is developing a suite of guid-ance documents to promote the highest possible standards in residential development and the provision of sustainable communities with access to the requisite range of public services and facilities. Included in the guidance is the promotion of better quality living standards, sustainable residential development and energy efficiency.  In particular, in March 2007 at the National Housing Conference, my Department launched new design guidelines on housing delivery entitled Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities. The conference, which was jointly organised by my Department and the RIAI, had as its central theme the housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.</P>
        <P>The chief purpose of the conference was to debate implementation issues which need to be addressed if we are to transform the Irish housing environment to meet the challenges ahead that are identified in the policy statement. The conference, and associated study tours, demonstrated considerable evidence of integrated approaches to the delivery of housing and greater consciousness of quality in urban design.  A subsequent conference, which addressed energy efficiency measures in the revised Building Regulations which come into operation in July and sustainability issues, as well as new approaches to dwelling design, was held in January 2008 and further events of this nature are planned.</P>
        <P>In addition, in September 2007, new guidelines for planning authorities entitled Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments were published. These were followed by the publication by my Department, in February 2008, of draft guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable residential development in urban areas, for public consultation. The consultation period has now ended and the finalised guidelines will be published later in 2008.</P>
        <P>In the private rental sector, while responsibility for enforcement of the private rented accommodation standards as prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993 rests with the local authorities, I am committed to ensuring that a robust framework is in place to promote improved standards in this part of the residential sector. My Department has provided significantly increased resources to support inspections by local authorities and this performance-linked funding is translating into significantly increased enforcement activity on the ground. I will continue to take the opportunity, when meeting with local authorities, to emphasise the high priority that must be assigned to effective action in this area.</P>
        <P>The revision of the Standards Regulations themselves is an important element of an Action programme to promote improvement in standards, which was launched on foot of the Towards 2016 agreement. On foot of a general review of the current Regulations, a Working Group comprising local authority and sectoral representatives is in place and has met twice so far to input into the final drafting of the revised Regulations. Following a short further period of consultation, I intend to finalise the new Regulations in July.</P>

	<P>The principal recommendation in the Ninth Progress Report of the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution (APOCC), on Private Property, was for the implementation of the central proposal of the 1973 majority &mdash; Kenny Report &mdash;  a  &ldquo;designated area scheme&rdquo; under which local authorities would be empowered to compulsorily acquire land for general development purposes, at its existing use value plus 25%, rather than at open market value.  In the light of a range of substantive legal, practical and financial considerations, successive Governments since the 1970&rsquo;s have not proceeded with such a scheme. </P>
        <P>However, the Government has approved the drafting of a Designated Land (Housing Development) Bill to provide for a &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; scheme.  The General Scheme of the Bill provides for: powers for planning authorities to enter into a binding agreement with, or  impose requirements on, the owners of designated land in order to bring such land into housing development; an amended compensation mechanism whereby designated land, if not developed in agreement with, or in accordance with requirements imposed by, the relevant planning authority, could be compulsorily acquired at below market value; and as a possible alternative to compulsory acquisition, the imposition by planning authorities of an annual development incentive levy on designated land.  The General Scheme also provides for mandatory registration of, and the imposition of a levy on, land purchase options. It is anticipated that the Bill will be drafted not later than the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>The APOCC report recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that: there should be a &lsquo;one stop shop&rsquo; planning procedure for strategic infrastructural projects;  the right to compensation for the acquisition of property rights below a specified depth under the surface should be removed, and the existence of land purchase options should be made public to achieve transparency in property markets generally.  The Strategic Infrastructure Act 2006 introduced a streamlined planning consent procedure for strategic infrastructure developments and amended the rules of compulsory acquisition to provide that the value of any land lying 10 metres or more below the surface shall be taken to be nil, unless it can be shown to be of greater value by a claimant.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 558 to 561, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>While continuing to have a particular focus on the Greater Dublin Area, the remit of the Affordable Homes Partnership was extended in June 2007 in relation to a number of affordable housing issues.  These include issues in relation to communications on affordable housing, and common approaches to affordable housing application systems and to the implementation of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006.  In relation to affordable housing supply, the Partnership was requested to conduct a study on ways in which the range of existing affordable housing mechanisms might be improved or expanded in order, principally, to increase supply and accelerate delivery.  The study is now completed and the resultant report, &ldquo;Increasing Affordable Housing Supply&rdquo;, has been published for public consultation with a view to submitting proposals to Government following completion of the consultation process underway.  The particular issues referred to in the questions would fall to be considered in that context.</P>
        <P>The housing policy statement of February 2007, &ldquo;Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities&rdquo;, signalled the intention to introduce a scheme of tenant purchase for local authority apartments and a scheme of incremental purchase targeted at households with an income lower than that required for affordable housing.  Work is continuing on the drafting of the necessary legislative provisions for these schemes in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is scheduled to be published in the current parliamentary session.  Arrangements are also being considered for the piloting of the proposed incremental purchase scheme in certain areas.</P>

	<P>In addition to the comprehensive legislative framework already in place, and in keeping with the Programme for Government commitment, my Department issued updated policy guidance to planning authorities in February 2008 on the taking in charge of estates in the form of circular letter PD 1/08.  Each planning authority is now being asked to develop or update, as appropriate, its policy on taking in charge by the end of June 2008, on the basis of the framework, and wider housing and planning guidance, as set out in the annex to the circular. </P>
        <P>The new guidance is primarily focused on proactively addressing the issue of taking in charge at the pre-planning stage.  The main principles now set out in the overall framework for taking in charge are: a statement of the facilities that will be taken in charge and the maintenance services that will be provided must be set out and the issue of taking in charge must be addressed at the pre-planning stage with the approved design facilitating the taking in charge of core facilities; developers will be required, through the development management process, to complete residential developments to a standard that is in compliance with the planning permission granted; planning authorities must take all necessary measures in this regard in particular through securing adequate bonds, inspection of construction and the taking of <Col N="1022"/>enforcement action when necessary; and the procedures for taking in charge will begin promptly on foot of a request by the majority of the residents in the development or by the developer, as appropriate; protocols, including time frames, must be set out by planning authorities to respond to requests for taking in charge; in general, planning authorities must not attach the establishment of management companies as a condition of planning in respect of traditional housing estates; in relation to older estates, priority must continue to be given to resolving those estates that have been left unfinished or not taken in charge for the longest period.</P>
        <P>This new approach, coupled with the extensive powers already available to planning authorities to deal with non compliant developers, will appropriately address the issue of unfinished estates.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 563 to 565, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>My Department issued Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for Apartments on 18 September 2007, with the aim of promoting sustainable urban housing by ensuring that the design and layout of new apartments provide high quality accommodation for a variety of household types and sizes, including families with children.  The guidelines have a strong emphasis on family living which is reflected in the minimum floor areas and other dimensions cited.  They also address and give guidance on issues such as: access; safety and security; general storage areas in apartments; communal refuse storage facilities, including recycling; car and bicycle parking; adequate daylight and sunlight in apartments; minimising noise transmission between apartments; communal and private open space; and recreational and play facilities for children.  The guidelines were issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which requires planning authorities to have regard to them in the performance of their functions, and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.</P>
        <P>Draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas were issued by my Department for public consultation in early February.  These draft guidelines, which are accompanied by a best practice Urban Design Manual, call for high-quality standards in terms of the design and layout of new residential areas which are properly integrated with good transport links, community and recreation facilities.  They also cover the <Col N="1023"/>broad range and types of urban development from city centre developments down to residential developments in small towns and villages.  The public consultation period closed on 6 May and the Department is currently collating and considering the submissions received.  The draft guidelines and Urban Design Manual are available to view on my Department&rsquo;s website.  These guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Act when finalised later this year.</P>
        <P>Section 10(2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 requires development plans to include objectives for the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities and recreational amenities and, also, the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community such as childcare facilities.  Section 19 of the Act also requires local area plans to be consistent with the objectives of the development plan for the area.</P>
        <P>In order to assist planning authorities in the preparation and implementation of development plans, my Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans in June 2007.  These guidelines, inter alia, emphasise the objectives for the provision of public open space and recreation space, including space/places for children to play and the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities and recreational amenities.  These guidelines were also issued under section 28 of the Act and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007 &mdash; 2009 incorporates a national water conservation sub-programme under which grant aid of &euro;288 million is available over the three years to local authorities to fund: management systems to monitor water use and loss in the public supply networks, targeted leakage control measures, whereby local authorities locate and repair leaking pipes; and the rehabilitation and replacement of obsolete supply networks, where repair has proven to be uneconomic due to the age or condition of the pipes. </P>
        <P>These measures enable local authorities to reduce unaccounted for water levels in public distribution networks, improve the quality of supply to consumers, lower operating costs and maximise the value of investments in new works.  Article 9.1 of the EU Water Framework Directive requires Member States to take account of the principle of water services cost recovery, including environmental and resource costs, in accordance with the polluter pays principle.  The Directive is being implemented in Ireland in relation to the non-domestic sector on the basis of recovery of all non-domestic water services costs from non-domestic users of the services through water charges.  This is being achieved by means of a meter based volumetric charge to ensure water charging of users according to actual consumption.  The metering of all non-domestic users is expected to be completed before the end of 2008.  Water charging in respect of non-domestic use should incentivise efficiency and conservation.</P>
        <P>A pilot rainwater harvesting project is being undertaken by the Dublin Institute of Technology on behalf the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee.  The overall objective of the project is to: determine the role and benefit of rainwater harvesting as a demand management tool; quantify the amount of harvestable rainwater at farmyard and domestic building level; measure and compare rainwater against mains water usage for farm use and for domestic purposes; determine the costs and benefits involved and calculate the pay-back period; and produce guidelines on rainwater harvesting based on experience with the project.</P>
        <P>There are two separate elements to the pilot project, a household application and a farmyard application.  The household project is being undertaken in a private housing development in <Col N="1024"/>Co. Carlow, supplied from a small public water scheme.  The farmyard project is located in a farm in County Meath.  It involves the harvesting of water from three barns, each with a total roof area of 1,000 sq metres.  Monitoring of the operation of the project is ongoing.</P>

	<P>Under the Waste Management Acts statutory responsibility for the making of regional waste management plans, which includes determinations in regard to the waste management infrastructure appropriate to each region, rests with the local authority (or local authorities) concerned and my Department has no function in this regard.  The proposed development in question is by a private company and my Department has no function in relation to this facility which it is understood will be the subject of an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning permission under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  Under the Planning and Development Acts the Minister is specifically precluded from involvement in a matter for which the Board has statutory responsibility. </P>
        <P>My Department and I hold regular consultations with stakeholders in the context of the ongoing implementation of Government policy on waste management.  Consulting widely, with a range of stakeholders, is designed to ensure that my Department and I have as full as possible an understanding of the issues and concerns of stakeholders and are therefore in a position to address them, where it is possible and appropriate to do so.  Such consultations are also useful to assist me and my Department in keeping up to date on alternative technologies to landfill and to traditional incineration.  In July 2007 I met with an environmental consultant acting on behalf of the proposers of the project.  The purpose of this meeting, and of a separate meeting with my Department, was to outline a form of thermal treatment of waste which differs from conventional municipal waste incineration.  There was, of course, no question of these discussions comprehending matters proper to the physical planning or environmental licensing processes from which I, and my Department, are precluded from involvement.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government clearly sets out the approach to waste management that will be reflected in national policy in the years ahead.  It is firmly grounded in a continuing commitment to the waste hierarchy with a renewed drive towards the achievement of international best practice in the reduction, re-use and recycling of our waste.  This, coupled with an increasing emphasis on technologies for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste, will significantly reduce potential reliance on landfill and incineration.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 573 to 576, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for storage of manual voting equipment has always been a matter for the local returning officers and so similar responsibility was assigned to them in regard to the electronic voting equipment. In the majority of cases, leases were entered into by them for the storage of the machines, which have a 20-year lifespan.  The Government decision to centralise storage of the electronic voting equipment was made taking into account a range of factors, including costs of local and centralised arrangements and the likely benefits to be realised; the majority of the electronic voting machines are now stored in containers at Gormanston Camp.</P>
        <P>Information provided by returning officers to my Department indicates that the total annual storage costs incurred by them in respect of the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment in 2007 is some &euro;489,000, with figures for 2004, 2005 and 2006 amounting to some &euro;658,000; &euro;696,000; and &euro;706,000 respectively.  Costs incurred to date in respect of the movement of the electronic voting equipment to centralised storage arrangements are some &euro;328,000.  Further costs will be incurred in relation to the completion of these arrangements, including buy-out costs.</P>
        <P>The following table sets out information provided by returning officers regarding storage arrangements entered into by them in each of the 25 locations involved.</P>

        <P FLI="0">My Department engaged consultants with valuation expertise in May 2007, following a competitive tendering process, to examine individual lease arrangements and to make recommendations as to termination of the leases, where appropriate. The consultants&rsquo; recommendations are currently under consideration in the Department.  I am at present considering the next steps to be taken in relation to this project. In this, I am taking into account the work of the Commission on Electronic Voting, which has examined the system, relevant experiences and developments internationally, and the need to maintain public confidence in the electoral process, as well as the provisions in the Programme for Government relating to electoral reform generally.</P>

	<P>The provision of accommodation by approved voluntary and co-operative housing bodies is an integral part of the Department&rsquo;s overall response to delivering on housing need for older people.  Under the Capital Assistance Scheme, funding of up to 100% of the approved cost is available for the provision of permanent accommodation for <Col N="1029"/>groups with special housing needs, including the elderly, homeless and people with disabilities. Overall expenditure under the Capital Assistance Scheme for the 5-year period 2003 to 2007 amounted to &euro;476m. This year the allocation for the scheme is being increased from &euro;113m in 2007 to a record &euro;130m.  These figures do not include funding for accommodation provided for homeless persons by Local Authorities under their social housing programmes.  </P>
        <P>Given that the special needs accommodation provided by voluntary housing bodies may be multi-purpose or may not be categorised specifically, and taking account of the fact that the accommodation needs of homeless persons can also be met from within the main local authority housing programmes, separate figures are not available for capital expenditure on accommodation for homeless persons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a directive establishing a framework for the protection of soil was considered at the Environment Council meeting of 20 December 2007 and did not have sufficient Member State support to achieve a political agreement.  The proposed Directive has the objective of establishing a common strategy for the protection and sustainable use of soil based on the principles of integration of soil concerns into other policies, preservation of soil functions within the context of sustainable use, prevention of threats to soil and mitigation of such effects, as well as restoration of degraded soils to a level of functionality consistent at least with the current and approved future use. An assessment of the potential impacts for Ireland will focus on any revised proposals to emerge.  </P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 628 of 17 April 2008.  As indicated in that reply, a recent review of the state of our bogs confirmed that continuing damage was occurring, with losses of the remaining raised bog at a rate of 2%-4% per annum.  In the light of this scientific evidence, it would not be appropriate to extend the 10-year derogation for raised bogs designated prior to 2002.</P>

	<P>Under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966, housing authorities are responsible for the management and maintenance of dwellings, of which they are the owner, provided under the Act.  Regulations under the section allow that the tenant may, with the consent of the authority, exchange the tenancy of his/her house for the tenancy of another house provided by a housing authority.  The administration of tenancy transfers are a matter <Col N="1031"/>for individual housing authorities having regard to individual schemes of priorities for letting dwellings under section 11 of the Housing Act 1988.</P>

	<P>As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government I have overall responsibility for the legislative and policy framework governing development contribution schemes.  Under sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority that benefit development in the area, based on a scheme of contributions adopted by the elected members of the authority.  The money collected in development levies is used to fund public infrastructure servicing new development, for example, roads, water and waste water services, community and other facilities.</P>
        <P>Development contribution schemes are adopted by the members of the local authority following a public consultation process. It is a matter for the elected members of the planning authority to determine the level of contribution and the types of infrastructure to which it will apply the contributions in its own functional area having regard to the governing legislative and policy framework.  The operation of the development contributions system will be kept under review by my Department.</P>

	<P>The provision of accommodation by approved voluntary and co-operative housing bodies is an integral part of my Department&rsquo;s overall response to delivering on social housing need.  Local authorities and approved housing bodies are working in close co-operation to deliver an expanded range of social housing options and a wide range of accommodation types to meet the needs of low-income families and persons with special housing needs.</P>
        <P>A number of approved housing bodies, including Cl&uacute;id and Respond!, are co-operating with local authorities in delivering, through a partnership arrangement, integrated housing developments comprising of voluntary housing units as well as social and affordable housing. In these circumstances, approved housing bodies support the housing authority in implementing its social and affordable housing programme and act as project managers for the planning, procurement and construction stages of  integrated projects. There are no arrangement in place at present for the direct provision of affordable homes by approved voluntary housing bodies.</P>
        <P>My predecessor asked the Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP) to consider how the range of existing affordable housing mechanisms might be improved or expanded by new initiatives to increase supply, accelerate delivery, improve access and affordability and deliver value for money for any associated resources required.  The resultant report was published last month <Col N="1032"/>for consultation, providing an opportunity for interested parties to comment on the recommendations and future directions of affordable housing.  My Department also approved two pilot projects, based on an equity-sharing model, to facilitate home ownership by low-income families. These projects were undertaken by the National Association of Building Co-operatives and are now complete. Any future expansion of the equity-sharing model will be considered in the light of the AHP report and the associated consultation process.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 568, 588 and 589 together.</P>
        <P>The Housing Aid for Older People Scheme is administered by local authorities and is part of a revised framework of grant aid, introduced in November 2007, to assist older people and people with a disability with their accommodation needs.  The Scheme, which amalgamates the provisions of the old Essential Repairs Grant Scheme and the existing Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme (SHAE), is designed to provide targeted support to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people.</P>
        <P>The Scheme facilitates the implementation of a Government Decision, taken in February 2006, to transfer the SHAE from the Health Service Executive to my Department.  That decision arose on foot of a recommendation made in the Core Functions of the Health Service Report that a more integrated service and better value for money may be achieved by transferring responsibility for the SHAE Scheme to the local authorities, who already had responsibility for the Essential Repairs and Disabled Persons Grant Schemes.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the need to ensure a smooth and seamless transfer of the SHAE Scheme from the HSE to the local authority sector.  To allow sufficient time to resolve relevant issues, including the allocation of staffing and other resources, it has been agreed with the HSE that the SHAE Scheme will continue to operate and be administered by the HSE, until such time as the appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure that the local authorities are in a position to accept the scheme on transfer.  My Department is engaged on an ongoing basis with the HSE to conclude this process as quickly as possible.  In the meantime, applicants who require repairs or improvements to their homes can avail of either the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme or the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme.</P>
        <P>The Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department, together with 20% contribution <Col N="1033"/>from the resources of the local authority.  Notification of the combined capital allocations for 2008 in respect of the Schemes will shortly issue to local authorities.  It is a matter for local authorities to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the Schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the Schemes in their area from within this allocation.</P>

	<P>The treatment of payments made from the Salmon Hardship Fund for tax purposes is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners in their assessment of each individual&rsquo;s liabilities.</P>
        <P>I am advised, however, that the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that payments from the Salmon Hardship Scheme, which is quite different in nature from the whitefish fleet decommissioning referred to by the Deputy, will be taxable on recipients as income in the year of receipt.  Therefore, commercial fishermen will have to include any payment received under the scheme as a receipt in their accounts.  That part of the payment which relates to six times the value of the 2006 licence fee will not, however, be liable to tax.  I understand that Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which is administering the scheme, has identified that element of the payment separately for recipients so that they can exclude the amount from their income tax returns.</P>

	<P>The Warmer Homes Scheme provides insulation and other energy efficiency solutions to low income homes across Ireland.  The service is coordinated by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and is delivered principally through Community Based Organisations.  The scheme is targeted at householders who are in receipt of the Fuel Allowance, Disability Benefit or Invalidity Benefit and is provided either free of charge or for a nominal fee (less than &euro;100).  Households are identified by community based installers working closely in association with other intermediaries including the St. Vincent de Paul Society, Health Services and GP networks.  The following table summarises the expenditure on the Warmer Homes Scheme since 2006.</P>

	<P>The Greener Homes Scheme provides support to homeowners to invest in a range of domestic renewable energy heating technologies including solar panels, biomass boilers and stoves and heat pumps.  There has been a strong interest in the scheme since it was launched in March 2006.  On foot of the achievement of the scheme targets a full three years ahead of schedule, Phase I of the Greener Homes Scheme was closed on 3 September 2007. Phase II of the scheme was opened on 1 October 2007.</P>
        <P>The objective in Greener Homes Phase II is to consolidate the market, underpinning it with quality standards and training and providing for a long-term future that is not grant dependent.  The aim is to ensure that the market for these products, services and fuels continues to develop strongly in a robust manner and that consumers continue to be guided towards discerning choices.  Continuing the scheme will help secure a range of objectives including more competitive offerings, revised product standards, improved training standards and stable growth across the renewable heating industry.  The Greener Homes Scheme will continue to be kept under review and will continue to evolve in light of maturing technologies and market developments.</P>
        <P>I have also recently announced an electricity microgeneration programme whereby grant support to meet 50% of the initial start up costs will be made available for the installation of microgeneration systems in approximately 50 trials to be conducted nationwide.  This programme is being administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and will focus on commercial/organisational on-site generation in its initial phases.  It will subsequently concentrate on generation by individual householders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Statutory responsibility for monitoring and ensuring quality of electricity supply rests with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The performance of the electricity networks has significantly improved in recent years.  This reflects the considerable investment of approximately &euro;3 billion in both our transmission and distribution networks that has taken place in the period 2001 to 2005, with another &euro;3 billion planned for investment up to 2010.  In allowing for capital expenditure in its revenue determination the CER sets challenging performance standards and monitors performance to ensure these are achieved.</P>
        <P>As distribution system operator, ESB Networks is required by the CER to maintain certain levels of quality of supply and to report annually on the criteria set out by the CER.  These service level requirements are reinforced with financial incentives, rewards for achieving better service and penalties for failure.  I have been advised by the CER that, while the data for 2007 is yet to be finalised, that for 2006 shows positive downward trends continuing in the two key metrics for quality of supply, Customer Minutes Lost and Verified Voltage complaints.  In addition, the twelve specific guarantees of quality of service delivery are set out in the Distribution Services guarantees section of the ESB customer charter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 602 and 603 together.</P>
        <P>Definitive figures on bio-fuel production for 2007 have not yet been finalised and it is likely that the figures included here will increase when all the data is available.  Based on provisional figures currently available bio-fuels represented 0.60% of the total fuel consumption in Ireland in 2007.  The provisional figures for 2007 are a significant increase on figures for 2005 and 2006 which were 0.04% and 0.09% respectively of the total fuel consumption in Ireland.  Following the introduction of the Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme, there have been increases in production towards year end 2007, despite increases in input prices.  While there is no specific information available relating to the percentage of Irish bio-fuel production, which is waste based and crop based, I can advise the Deputy that bio-fuels being produced here rely on a range of feedstocks which include soya oil, waste recovered vegetable oils, tallow and whey along with energy crops such as  oil seed rape and wheat.</P>
        <P>Provisional figures for the production of bioethanol in 2007 indicate that over 5500 tonnes was produced which represents 0.07% of the total road transport fuel consumption in Ireland in 2007.  The nature of ethanol production is such that large scale investment is required with significant lead in time for production start up.  There are currently two producers of bioethanol in Ireland and a number of other operators have plans in that direction.  We have committed <Col N="1038"/>to the overall EU bio-fuels target as set out in the EU Commission presentation on the 23 January last which includes a commitment to insuring the environmental sustainability of any new bio-fuel supplier.  In order to meet these EU targets we are preparing for our own national bio-fuel obligation scheme which will be going out for public consultation in a matter of weeks.</P>
