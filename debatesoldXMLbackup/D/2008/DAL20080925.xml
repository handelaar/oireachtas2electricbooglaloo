    <Title>Request to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Anois, iarratas chun tairiscint a dh&eacute;anamh an D&aacute;il a chur ar athl&oacute; faoi Bhuan-Ord&uacute; 32.  We will now deal with a request to move the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss a matter of specific and important public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the urgent need for a full debate on how jobs will be created and maintained in the Border region, which has suffered more than most with the winding down of jobs in the furniture industry and the timber frame industry, by firms such as IJM and Century Homes, the Kingspan Group plc and Roadstone, and the food industry, by firms such as Grove Turkeys; and the fact that inward investment has not been attracted to the area by IDA Ireland and that no real support has been given to the tourism industry, despite great efforts on the part of individual companies.  These problems are worthy of a full debate and action is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Tar &eacute;is breithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an n&iacute; ardaithe, n&iacute;l s&eacute; in ord faoi Bhuan-Ord&uacute; 32.  Having considered the matter raised, it is not in order under Standing Order 32.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 3, Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed).  Private Members&rsquo; business shall be No. 43, motion re the Irish economy (resumed) to be taken after the Order of Business and to conclude after 90 minutes, if not previously concluded.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the briefing relating to pre-budget growth figures be given.  The purpose of this briefing is that Opposition Members might gain an indication of what will underpin the budget to be introduced on 14 October.  The Taoiseach stated yesterday that a briefing will be provided.  When will this happen and what will be the extent of the information that will be given to Opposition Members?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister for Transport come before the House today to reassure people regarding the safety of the Dublin Port tunnel?  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd tabled a Private Notice Question on the matter yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="868"/>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It was disallowed but is under consideration for today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but it was disallowed by the Office of the Ceann Comhairle on the basis that the National Roads Authority does not have direct responsibility in this area.  It is a matter of public concern that a major report has indicated that the systems relating to the safety of the Dublin Port tunnel will not measure up in the event of something going wrong.  It might be appropriate if the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, came before the House later to give a statement of reassurance in respect of the safety of the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has indicated that a second probe into what she terms &ldquo;possible fraudulent activities within F&Aacute;S&rdquo; is ongoing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to interrupt but the difficulty is that none of these matters is in order.  I want to be helpful&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Ceann Comhairle mean by stating that they are not in order?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not in order on the Order of Business.  If Members wish to change the rules, that is a matter for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Ceann Comhairle stating it is not in order for me to ask a question in respect of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s indication that the Government will provide a briefing regarding the growth forecasts that will underpin the budget?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The full list of matters that can be raised is set out in Standing Orders but the issue to which the Deputy refers is not included.  On a number of previous occasions I stated that the full list of matters which can be raised includes business on the Order Paper, the taking of business which has been promised and the making of primary and secondary legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle is well aware that this will be a critical budget for the country and the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not make the rules.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Members should be entitled to comment or ask questions on the utterances of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem may relate to the fact that Leaders Questions are not taken on Thursday mornings.  However, that is a matter for Members.  I can do nothing about it, I can only enforce the rules of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>All I did was to ask the T&aacute;naiste when the briefing will be provided and to what extent information will be provided to Members.  I will ask a question that is in order but I hope the Minister for Transport will come before the House.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government clearly indicates that a constitutional referendum on children&rsquo;s rights will be held.  If absolute liability in cases of statutory rape is to be restored to the Statute Book, a constitutional referendum will be required.  This matter is not mentioned in any of the legislative lists with which we have been provided.  Do I take it that the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights will proceed and that legislation relating to this matter will be published or has the Government abandoned its solemn commitment to hold such a referendum?  The <Col N="869"/>T&aacute;naiste will be aware of comments made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the effect that cases cannot be taken in the absence of a constitutional referendum.</P>
        <P>A solemn commitment was given in the programme for Government and this was repeated on many occasions by Deputy Bertie Ahern when he served as Taoiseach.  Will the T&aacute;naiste respond on behalf of the Government and clarify, once and for all, whether it is intended to honour the commitment to which I refer and whether legislation relating to a constitutional referendum on absolute liability in cases of statutory rape will be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised or forthcoming in respect of a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the committee charged with dealing with this matter met yesterday.  We are trying to achieve a consensus.  If such a consensus is forthcoming, further deliberations can be engaged in and decisions can be made.  However, it would be appropriate to allow the committee to complete its deliberations.  My party has submitted a detailed proposal on this matter and it is on the basis of this that we can await an outcome.</P>
        <P>On the other issues to which the Deputy referred, the Taoiseach indicated that as much information as possible will be made available to the Opposition during the preparatory phase leading up to the budget.  We anticipate that when the third quarter figures become available at the end of next week or at the beginning of the following week, information will be provided to Opposition Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shatter submitted detailed proposals on behalf of the Fine Gael Party to the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children by the date requested.  The Government is not going to make a submission to the committee.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il Members on the committee are to make a submission, not on behalf of their party but rather on their own behalf as a group.  We need to know whether a referendum relating to this matter will take place.  There appears to have been a complete rowing back by the committee on this issue, which is of such extreme and sensitive importance that the Director of Public Prosecutions was forced to comment upon it.</P>
        <P>The Government is not making a submission and neither is the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  My understanding is that the members of Fianna F&aacute;il who are serving on the committee are going to make a submission on their own behalf.  Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify the position and indicate whether a referendum is to take place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Strictly speaking, that is a matter for the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an extremely important issue and if we are to address it, the most appropriate and mature way of doing so would be through consensus.  I believe that is the considered view of the majority of Members of the House.</P>
        <P>I refer to the submissions.  The committee agreed on the methodology by which people would put forward their views.  The legal advisers would then assess that and a decision would be made in due course.  As the Deputy knows, the Minister is also a member of that committee and he represents the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>So does the T&aacute;naiste but she will not answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to pursue a little further the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reply about the information which will be made available to the Opposition and the House in advance of the budget.  I ask her specifically about the statement made by the Minister for Finance last night that it is his wish to have a redundancy scheme across the public service.  Is it intended to <Col N="870"/>present a paper to the House setting out the areas, Departments and State agencies where the Government considers there are numbers or posts which are surplus to requirement?</P>
        <P>In that regard, I draw the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s attention to a reply to a parliamentary question she gave yesterday to my colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, which showed that in her Department, there are now 46 civil servants working in her private and constituency office and in the private and constituency offices of her Ministers of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore knows he cannot raise that. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 46 civil servants working in the private and constituency offices of the T&aacute;naiste and her Ministers of State at a cost of &euro;3 million per year.  The Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot go into that today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who describes civil servants as unfeathered, plump State hens, has ten civil servants&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is well aware that we cannot raise that matter now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;working in his private and constituency office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the T&aacute;naiste on the availability of budget documentation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Ten civil servants makes the Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, a pretty plump State gander.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I hesitate to interrupt Deputy Gilmore in full oratorical flow but the facts of the matter are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The chickens are coming home to roost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever about ganders and geese, as I said yesterday, we cannot go into that now.  I call the T&aacute;naiste on the availability of the budget documentation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I have another question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a process in respect of the budget which has been established for many years.  The Minister for Finance indicated he would make as much information as possible available to Members of the House within the normal budgetary constraints.</P>
        <P>On the last issue and the little quip, I work within the realms of the Department of Finance&rsquo;s regulations, as do all my colleagues.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Seymour Crawford. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Deputy Gilmore give me a break?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only day two and I am only getting started.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="871"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what worries me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, the Taoiseach told the House new legislation in regard to employment matters would be required arising from the agreement with the social partners.  What legislation will the T&aacute;naiste publish arising from that agreement and when will she do so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, we are currently dealing with a number of Bills, including the employment law compliance Bill, which is a huge piece of legislation, an industrial relations amendment Bill, an industrial development Bill and the Employment Agency Regulation Bill.  One or two of those Bills will have to be amended to reflect the agreement.  That will be on the basis that the agreement is accepted by all sides.  We will have to consult the social partners on a number of other Bills.  I anticipate another Bill on the basis of that.  At present we do not have a final decision on the format of that legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask a very important question.  When will the Bill on long-term subvention for nursing home care be before the House?  When will it be implemented?  When can we advise people that they will have some rights as far as nursing home subvention is concerned?  The issue is causing very serious problems for the elderly and their families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach answered the question yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not get an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The legalities have been addressed and we anticipate that the matter will be brought forward very quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has any work been done on the heads of the landlord and tenants Bill?  If so, when is it anticipated?  The date of its publication is very vague.  Is it possible to indicate whether any work has been done on the heads of the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible to say when it will be brought to finality.  The Minister has indicated that there are 102 heads to the Bill, so it will take a considerable amount of work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>My next question is close to the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s heart.  I refer to the legislation to implement the Dalton report.  I understand the heads of the Bill have been agreed and that drafting is taking place.  How long will drafting take and how much of it has been done already?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is to amend the greyhound Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle could answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Ceann Comhairle is anxious to hear the answer as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be available in the middle of next year.  I wonder why I answer the questions in the first place when Deputy Durkan has the answers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was only checking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, the Minister for Health and Children announced the establishment of an inquiry into services and recent tragic consequences at Ennis General <Col N="872"/>Hospital.  Have the terms of reference of that inquiry been drawn up?  Will they be presented in the House and will it have the opportunity to scrutinise them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The terms of reference are critical.  An inquiry is being established and there is not only concern within the greater Ennis area but throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order now.  The Deputy will have to find some other way to raise that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the investigation initiated by the T&aacute;naiste into management practices at F&Aacute;S.  When does she anticipate that the report will be available?  Will she intervene with the director of F&Aacute;S to put on a special F&Aacute;S course for the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and his golf buddies on arithmetics so they will not be misled again or that the Government will not be caused such embarrassment again as has happened in the case of student fees?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated in the House yesterday, the Comptroller and Auditor General has been requested by me to investigate the matter.  We will await the discussions and deliberations of the Committee of Public Accounts at which stage terms of reference will be finalised.  I hope there will be a speedy examination of the investigation.  The report will then be laid before the House and will come to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste do anything for Batt?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Before the summer recess, the T&aacute;naiste was kind enough to say she was prioritising the issue of management companies.  As she knows, tens of thousands of young people are paying very high management company fees.  She said the legislation would involve three Departments.  The Law Reform Commission has reported with its own draft Bill for owner managed companies.  When can we expect this legislation?  It is a considerable problem for the property market that so many young people are being charged these huge fees by developers and their agents.  There is no regulation to protect people from being fleeced.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste, on the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There was considerable discussion on that matter yesterday.  The situation is that we have yet to make a final decision as to whether we will have an omnibus piece of legislation or make three or four amendments to existing legislation.  The Attorney General will consider that in the context of the work we did during the summer, with a view to bringing it to Government very soon.  We are anxious to get progress on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that mean no legislation has been prepared or that the law reform legislation has not even been looked at?  The Law Reform Commission took two years to prepare the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The work has been done.  It is now just a matter of deciding on the methodology of how the legislation will be brought to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform told the House on a number of occasions that although the legislation covers three Departments, he had taken responsibility for the matter and would bring the legislation before the House.  Has that changed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  It is important to get clarity on this for once and for all.  It is under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and there are three Ministers involved in the legislation.  The quickest method of bringing the legislation to the House is the format we want to advance.  A final decision must be made by the Attorney General and he must advise whether we should amalgamate and provide new legislation or whether it would be more expeditious to amend existing legislation.  From what I can ascertain, the view is that, as there are three Departments involved, we must consider whether if we amend three pieces of legislation we will get the legislation through the House as quickly as if we had an omnibus piece of legislation. <Col N="874"/> The final decision will be made on the basis of how quickly the legislation can be brought through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>With due respect, the Minister&rsquo;s fast method sounds like a snail method.  It sounds like they are still having discussion on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton has had her say.  I call Deputy Stagg on the same issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been going on for five years, since Deputies Burton, Rabbitte, myself and others first raised the issue.  We have been getting a series of promises on legislation.  The last solid promise we got was that the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, would bring in legislation last March and it would be finalised.  Questions were put on the matter before last Christmas and the promise was the legislation would be enacted by last March.  Nothing has happened and we seem to be back further than we were at the beginning, with the T&aacute;naiste saying the Attorney General has to make up his mind.  Will the T&aacute;naiste twist his tail or put a burr under it or something and make him make up his bloody mind?  The people are suffering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the reason there are three Ministers working on the matter.  They worked at it on a number of occasions during the summer holidays.  The question is whether we want proper legislation brought to the House and that is the final decision to be made.  The legislation will be enacted quickly.  We had to await the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and the heads of a Bill were prepared by the Department on that basis.  The final decision will be made very soon.</P>

	<P>Some &euro;110 million was set aside last year to introduce the fair deal, but clearly the legislation in that regard will not be produced in advance of this year&rsquo;s budget and the money will remain unspent.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure that the upcoming budget will provide for that money to be released to health boards to alleviate the suffering of families and assist them with elderly people in nursing homes?  </P>

	<P>The Taxing Master of the High Court has drawn the attention of the House to the fact that many people are being ripped off in the legal fees they are being charged.  A Government committee sat and reported on this, but we have not yet had any action on the matter.  What priority does Government give to No. 74, the legal costs Bill?  This is a matter that affects not only ordinary families, but our competitiveness as a country.  At a time when we are considering what practical measures we may take in these difficult times, this Bill should be brought forward as a priority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity of speaking in support of the amendment tabled by my colleague, the Labour Party spokesperson on finance, Deputy Burton.  I agree with the request from Fine Gael and the Labour Party for a more substantial debate on the economy.  As I have only a short period of time available to me, I wish to concentrate on three aspects of the matter.</P>
        <P>The debate on the economy is totally inadequate.  It is flimsy and it does not deal with the fundamental issues.  I say this for two basic reasons.  The first is because the Minister for Finance is describing the external conditions, such as what he calls &ldquo;the credit crunch&rdquo; as a kind of international flu.  I wish to state immediately that those who want to look at the different models of international finance must conclude that a debate is taking place at present in Washington about how one should respond to the failure and collapse of the neoliberal model of non-regulation.  It is also interesting that the media, the members of which are not in the Press Gallery at present, came to accept a single model of the economy as the only model.  Like <Col N="881"/>others, I have had the privilege of working in a university where different versions of the economy were in fashion at different times.  After the Second World War, for example, this moved through Fordism and Keynesianism to the arrival of the Washington consensus.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I challenge the Government to state where it stands on the Washington consensus, which was created through collusion with the media and the control of universities.  That is why, for example, it is proposed to create the Friedman tower at the University of Chicago and the reason discrimination exists against academics within the United States system who hold different views.  Lest people say I am simply being anti-American, there is an absence internationally of any analysis of the different forms of capitalist structure.  There are differences between Asian capitalism, the kind of <i>rentier</i> capitalism practised in oil producing countries and the hegemonic capitalism which was driven by the Washington consensus.</P>
        <P>I have great respect for the Minister of State at the Department of Finance but I ask him not to mount a defence of the kind of illiterate economics and anti-intellectualism that would describe the international situation in which we find ourselves as some kind of flu or say that things have gotten very bad abroad.</P>
        <P>There are matters for which the Government has explicit responsibility.  One cannot blame the relationship between the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government and the speculative component of the building industry on the Washington consensus.  From 2006 there has been a crisis of management in the Irish economy which is not connected with waste but with economic structures, the fundamentals of which are available even to first-year students of economics.  In 2006 we imported more than we exported.  Between 1995 and 2000 the Irish growth rate was sustained by an export performance but exports flattened and in 2006 imports exceeded exports and there was a change in our balance of payments.  Nevertheless the growth rate stayed high.  That was because of little less than a property revaluation.  As property prices peaked in January 2007 there was a mad, wild speculative capitalism in the housing market, for which the Government has responsibility in the form of its endless sustenance and expansion of property-driven tax breaks for those who are not interested in housing but in speculative investment.  The insatiable demand for that expansion led to &euro;8.5 billion being invested by Irish people in property abroad.</P>
        <P>At the macro-economic level there is an international crisis of regulation.  There is a contradiction in the debate between Republicans and Democrats in the United States.  The Republican Party, in paper after paper from its research institutes such as the Cato Institute, with which the Minister of State will be familiar, set its face against even the Bretton Woods institutions, arguing that market competition between bad and good money, involving the yen, the dollar and the euro, would save us.  I challenge the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government to say where it stands.  Does it stand with the right-wing enterprise institutes in the United States on the international side of the crisis?  Is that crisis engendering an inchoate slash-and-burn response in this country, which sanctions cutbacks in public services, irrespective of whom they might affect?  What floor is being established whereby the most basic minimal rights in health, education, the environment and housing will be protected?  Having irresponsibly created a bubble the suggestion is that the Government can now contract that bubble without considering the impact of its public expenditure proposals in each of the categories that are responsible.</P>
        <P>I find it particularly depressing to witness the way the public is being softened up for some hard medicine.  It is as if there is an international flu and we have caught it.  The Government will have to dish out tough medicine and we will all have to put up with it.  If we live for two or three years we might survive but that is not good enough.  It is not good enough from the media, the Government or any political party.</P><Col N="882"/>
        <P>Let us ask tough questions and let the Minister reply.  Is he happy with the role of the Central Bank, which I explicitly contend is responsible for the disastrous abuse that took place in the area of housing?  Where were the warnings from the Central Bank?  In which particular quarterly report were they made?  When the Central Bank expressed concern did it seek legislative power from Government?  Did the Government read the quarterly report in question and decide it needed more accountability?</P>
        <P>We in Parliament are often criticised for the level of our wages and our expenses but what about those at the top of the Irish banks who awarded themselves hundreds of thousands of euro for creating a crisis by firing money indiscriminately at borrowers and increasing the mortgage ratio from between 3.5% and 4% of income, as it was for most of our lives, to between 15% and 20%?  That is a scandal and there is a dead silence on the matter as if this is an international virus which cannot be understood.  It can be understood.  The banking sector, in seeking to contract the false bubble it created in housing sustained by a larger artificial structure of credit, now says it wants all its money back in a hurry.</P>
        <P>How did this come to be?  What is the role of the Government and what should be done now?  Who should be protected during the disastrous policy of responding in the knee-jerk way I describe as &ldquo;slash and burn&rdquo;?  That would destroy more jobs, of which 73,000 have been lost since the beginning of this year.  The response must be economically literate, it must be principled and it must defend, internationally, the right of different models encompassing the economy, politics and society.  It must be truthful and must protect the weakest.  It must not be general in its ill-effect and one cannot use scapegoats.  Below the level of principal officer in the public services tens of thousands of civil and public servants draw family income supplement.  That amounts to a whole army of public servants.</P>
        <P>When the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy McGuinness, looks around for a scapegoat I suggest he look to the advisers who gave him not just illiterate economics but bad economics.  He should have the courage to change course.  He may look to the international situation for what must happen in the area of regulation.  At home, however, he should encourage people to understand how important it is in a Republic that citizens who are most vulnerable should be insulated against the outrageous mistakes of those who gave themselves hundreds of thousands of euro.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Michael Ahern, Chris Andrews and Michael McGrath.</P>
        <P>The sight, overnight, of an unusually humble President Bush addressing the American people on the parlous state of their economy is a vivid testimony to the extraordinary economic times in which we find ourselves.  They are extraordinary times in which pillars of world commerce, such as Lehman Brothers and AIG Insurance, fail and in which the foundations of the US home loan sector are crumbling and the availability of credit worldwide has virtually come to a halt.  Household banking names such as Halifax Bank of Scotland are being taken over within hours as normal rules of competition law are suspended to save the foundations of the system.  Ireland cannot be immune from these extraordinary times but, through Government policy and action in the past ten years, we have foundations in place to help us face into them.</P>
        <P>Our pension reserve fund, valued at &euro;19.5 billion, affords huge protection against the pension challenge we face in the future and is a protection many other countries do not have.  An ongoing public infrastructure programme, worth &euro;30 billion, is transforming roads and schools around the country.  Despite the serious challenges in the area of unemployment there remain more than 2 million people at work in the economy, with 700,000 new jobs having been created. <Col N="883"/> There have been job losses recently but there is job creation every week right across the country, a point which is being lost amid the news of losses.</P>
        <P>We have a very generous welfare system and State pensions have been transformed in the past ten years, now standing at a level of &euro;208 per week and increasing.  We have a highly educated, young and motivated workforce who, through their own efforts and intelligence and backed up by good staff and serious investment in third and fourth level education, are among the best in the world.</P>
        <P>It is important to reiterate these facts over and over because there are many who wish to discount them, ignore them and belittle the achievements of the past ten years.  There are many who, in the words of the motion, dismiss them as reckless budgetary policies while ignoring the many tangible benefits they have brought.  The forthcoming budget, on 14 October, will be tough and the Minister and the Taoiseach are not softening people up but telling it as it is.  It will be a budgetary response to the extraordinary times to which I have referred.  We cannot take for granted the changes and improvements in our country during the past 20 years.  We cannot presume, as many do, that the good economic times will always be with us.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party will be four-square behind the Minister for Finance on 14 October in regard to whatever decisions are made.</P>
        <P>Other parties challenge the Minister and accuse him of doing nothing in response to the crisis.  I challenge them to provide us with an alternative budget, to set out their stall so that they can be judged rather than offering cheap soundbites to journalists when present in the House or to the national newspapers.  I challenge further those who are calling for reform and criticising the Government for inaction not to spend the next 12 months running around the country criticising cutbacks while calling for more cutbacks in this Chamber without offering specifics.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the call by the Minister for Finance last night for a wider redundancy programme across the public service.  This is not a threat and should not be seen as one.  Redundancy programmes are modern management techniques in any workforce.  I appreciate the remarks made by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  It is unfortunate members of the media were not in the Press Gallery to hear them.  Redundancy programmes are available <Col N="884"/>everywhere.  In my view, many in the public service will use the opportunity to get out of it and apply their talents elsewhere.</P>
        <P>There are other issues which I would like the Minister to consider in the current economic situation.  The issue of prequalification for public contracts denies many small businesses access to them.  For example, in the construction sector many ably qualified builders cannot, for reasons relating to turnover, apply for jobs in schools and public building refurbishment contracts.  This turnover has nothing to do with their capacity to build or respond to a specific tender.  Turnover can be achieved in many ways.  The current system excludes small qualified contractors accessing public funds.  I fear it is also preventing us getting value for taxpayers&rsquo; money as these small contractors can do the job cheaper.</P>
        <P>Another issue requiring urgent attention is the importation of motor vehicles from Northern Ireland and, in particular, the UK.  I ask that the Minister ensure that the Revenue Commissioners allocate extra staff to ensure all imported vehicles comply with the law, revenue laws in particular, and are registered with the Revenue Commissioners in due time.  There is much evidence to suggest this is not what is happening.  This practice is undermining employment opportunities in the motor industry which is already under severe pressure.</P>
        <P>I referred at the outset to the extraordinary times in which we find ourselves.  An article in this morning&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> is testament to the worst excesses of the systems outlined by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  Hedge funds are betting hundreds of millions of euros that share values in Irish banks will fall.  They are effectively treating as pawns on a game board the people who work in the banks, customers and those whose lives are entwined with the banks through mortgages and savings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the banks put their assets on the balance sheet?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>Pressure on oil prices during the summer was partially caused by financial speculators.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>Those same speculators were also responsible in driving food and commodity prices.</P>
        <P>The decision by the Financial Regulator to suspend short-term selling is welcome and must be maintained for as long as possible.  However, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, should spend time, internationally, addressing these issues and should also address through the EU and UN, if possible, these excesses of capitalism.  I find myself agreeing with Deputy Higgins on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I have full confidence that the Government can deal with the challenges ahead.  Tough decisions will be made and are required to maintain the huge progress we, as an economy, have made in the past 20 years in particular.</P>
        <P>If the Opposition and, in particular, the main Opposition party, is interested in economic reform and public service reform, as it tells every journalist it is, it is time it set out its stall, laid down specific proposals in this regard and stopped running away from them when under a bit of pressure.</P>
        <P>It would be also interesting to hear if Fine Gael as a party has proposals rather than hearing from specific Deputies who are running off flying individual kites.  I support the Government <Col N="885"/>amendment to the motion tabled by the Opposition.  I have full faith in the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to address the challenges ahead.  I look forward to 14 October and to hearing Members opposite and, in particular, Deputy Varadkar, setting out their stall.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Calleary for sharing time with me.  I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  </P>
        <P>It is important to state at the outset that Ireland is part of a globalised economy.  Everybody, including the dogs in the streets, know this.  Our position in that world is affected by what happens in the United States of America.  The only people who do not appear to be aware Ireland is part of a global economy are Members of the Fine Gael Party.  The motion before the House makes no mention of the fact that Ireland is part of a globalised economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Clearly, Fine Gael is trying to blinker the public into believing that we in Ireland will be only affected by events in Ireland; that we alone can deal with them and that the meltdown in the US financial markets will have no impact on Ireland.  This is not the case.  There is an acceptance that savings must be made.  There is also an acceptance that we cannot return to the situation that prevailed in the 1980s.  Deputy Calleary stated that we are in a much better position now than we were in the 1980s and prior to that.  We now have more than 2 million people in work, a substantial pension fund and our best asset is our educated young workforce.</P>
        <P>The financial markets of any country depend on confidence in the system.  That lack of confidence did not originate in Ireland rather, it originated in the US.  Despite what Deputy Michael D. Higgins said, it has spread like a virus.  The financial markets are so delicately balanced that confidence has a significant impact on them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>They are so unaccountable and non-transparent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ChrisAndrews"><NameTxt>Deputy Chris Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>A lack of confidence in the US market has undermined confidence in Ireland and the wider economy.  One has to look no further than the situation that arose with Northern Rock, which was well capitalised, to see the real impact of a lack of confidence in the market.  Customers lost confidence in that bank and the rest is history.</P>
        <P>Some commentators and members of the Opposition speak about the economy and the financial markets in negative terms.  No one is suggesting there are not serious challenges ahead for the banks or the economy.  Everybody recognises this is the case.  It is the reason the budget has been brought forward to 14 October and I welcome that.</P>
        <P>The use of words such as &ldquo;we are facing a meltdown&rdquo; and commentators suggesting they are being muzzled is, in my opinion, completely irresponsible.  I do not believe this is in anyone&rsquo;s interest except perhaps those making the claims.  The banking model used in Ireland is different from that used in the US.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year members of the finance committee met with various stakeholders in New York and Washington and noted a clear absence of regulatory structures in the financial markets there.  What happened in America was that, from the hopeful homeowner to the brokers and right up to Wall Street, there was no one there to shout stop.  It was in nobody&rsquo;s interest to do so.  This is the outcome.  While we were on our visit to America, Henry Paulson announced that he intended to introduce plans for regulation, but it was said that it would not happen <Col N="886"/>until after the November election.  Clearly, self-regulation does not work.  Even the Republicans appear, reluctantly, to be accepting that now.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, the model is very different.  We have a much more robust regulatory framework overseeing the financial markets.  We have the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, the chairman of which appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service earlier this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>He has a lot of explaining to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ChrisAndrews"><NameTxt>Deputy Chris Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We also have the ECB, and the Department of Finance oversees matters.  Clearly, the Irish model is significantly different from the American model.  I read recently that 24% of mortgages in the US are sub-prime in nature, while in Ireland it is less than 3%.  Ireland&rsquo;s difficulties are not the same as those of the US, but the lack of confidence has had a major impact on us.  Years ago it used to be said that when Britain sneezed, Ireland got a cold.  Now, the US has pneumonia and Ireland will have to take its medicine.  People expect us to take that medicine.</P>
        <P>The OECD, in an economic survey earlier this year, stated that Irish banks were well capitalised and that their past large profits had given them a buffer to get them through the current difficulties.  That is the reality, despite what people like to say.  If there is any more volatility in the financial markets, it is unlikely some commentators will make it to Christmas without having a nervous breakdown.  The partnership deal reached a number of weeks ago was the result of much negotiation and compromise.  It is easy to say that one side did not go far enough or that the Government should have imposed X, Y or Z.  However, those who say that forget that it is about partnership and agreement.  It is a good compromise and I believe it will be one of the cornerstones on which the new and stronger economy will be built.</P>
        <P>The Opposition appears to want to have it every way.  As Deputy Calleary said, they use nice generalisations such as &ldquo;hunting down waste&rdquo;.  We all know the devil is in the detail.  It would be nice to hear them spell out which Ministers of State they feel are not needed any more.  Do they believe we should get rid of the Minister of State with responsibility for integration, or the Minister of State with responsibility for older people?  Are older people now somehow expendable in the Fine Gael ideology?  At a time when we need to maintain a cool head and steady nerves, I am delighted that we have a Minister for Finance who has the calmness, foresight and vision to get the economy into shape so that when the global economic upturn comes we will be in a position to benefit.  I support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words in this debate.  The greatest challenge facing us and the Government is to manage the economy through the international downturn we are experiencing, which is likely to continue for a considerable period.  There has been a rapid slowdown in the global economy arising from turbulence in the global financial markets, the credit squeeze, exchange rate shifts and the sharp rise in oil prices.  No one knows how quickly stability can be restored to the financial and equity markets worldwide.  As a small open economy we depend on exports, which represent up to 85% of our GDP.  Exports are the major driver of our economic success.  This means we are more exposed to those international factors than many other countries.  In conjunction with the dramatic slowdown in the housing market, this has had a dramatic effect on tax revenues, which leaves the Government with considerably less to spend.</P>
        <P>It is important to set the record straight on what has been achieved over the past 20 years or so.  The people have, through their application, talent and flair, established an economic platform that was unimaginable back then.  There has been an average growth rate of 5.5% <Col N="887"/>over the past five years.  Government debt has fallen from 32% to 23% of GNP and &euro;19.5 billion is now invested in the National Pension Reserve Fund.  An investment of more than &euro;30 billion in the biggest infrastructure programme <i>per capita</i> in Europe has been commenced.  Money was invested in schools, roads, public transport, communications, housing and the health service.  We have also dramatically increased the State pension for our elderly and child benefit for families with young children and we have significantly reduced the tax burden, particularly for the lower paid and those on average incomes.  We have increased the number of garda&iacute;, teachers, doctors, nurses and special needs assistants, and increased investment significantly for those with disabilities.  As the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, said yesterday, this is the record that has been described as representing reckless budgetary policies.  I ask the Opposition speakers to tell us what areas should not have received increased funding and where they would cut back expenditure.</P>

	<P>Deputy Bruton has consistently argued for restraint in public expenditure, but at his side and at his back, and in councils throughout the country, his colleagues have been shouting loudly for more and more expenditure in all areas.  Which is the real Fine Gael policy?  Is it Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s or is it that of the rest of the pack?</P>
        <P>The challenge facing the Government is not an easy one to overcome, as any fair-minded person will acknowledge, in view of what has happened in the US, across Europe and in international markets.  However, I have faith in Irish entrepreneurs, having been privileged, as Minister of State with responsibility for trade over five years or so, to see at first hand on many trade missions across the world how these men and women, in many diverse businesses, are capable of taking on the best any country can produce and succeeding.  These people were products of our excellent education system and we must ensure the system continues to receive the funding necessary to produce more and more highly qualified people to drive on the economy in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>As has been mentioned many times, regulation is important to ensure confidence and certainty in any system.  As was recognised by our Government in the last number of years, over-regulation was putting an excessive burden on many businesses and the Better Regulation report charted to way to reducing excessive regulation.  This must be continued in order to improve the competitiveness of Irish companies, but regulation is vital and it must not be thrown out.  As has been mentioned by previous speakers, lack of regulation in the US has led to the mess we are in today.</P>
        <P>I spent five years working in the building industry in the 1970s and early 1980s, at which time there was a downturn in the industry.  It was mainly due to high interest rates, high inflation, high unemployment and mass emigration.  The difficulties we are experiencing now are the results of different factors, one of which is the price of land.  There should be control over the price of land as it affects not only the price of houses, but also the price of agricultural land, public housing and many other things.  People with too much cash drive prices up to a level that is uneconomic for many industries.  This should be examined for the future.  We are in a cyclical world and these things will come around again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  I agree with the Deputy.</P>
        <P>What also happened back in the 1970s and early 1980s was that there was a pull-back of funding for apprenticeships.  When we came out of that downturn, there was a lack of skilled craftspeople.  That must not be allowed to happen now.  Inflation has also been mentioned.  I <Col N="888"/>have heard some Opposition speakers claim we have a very high rate of inflation compared with the rest of the EU.  However, they are comparing apples with oranges.  When using the EU harmonised index our inflation rate is approximately 3.2% compared with the EU average of 3.8%.  When people are quoting figures they should consider the facts.  We would have a better debate if they spoke about facts rather than fiction.  I accept the Opposition has a job to question the Government but it should speak factually.  I have confidence that my colleagues in government have the ability and courage to take the right decisions to protect the country&rsquo;s achievements to date and to chart the way forward through the troubled waters we are now in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in favour of the Government amendment to the motion before us.  We are now in a changed economic world.  What has happened in global financial markets in recent weeks is without precedent in modern history.  The proposed $700 billion rescue package for the financial institutions in the US is ten times what our public expenditure, current and capital, is likely to be in 2008.  The state of health of the global financial markets is directly linked to the strength of the US financial institutions, so it is in all of our interests that stability is restored to these institutions as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>As a small open economy, the fortunes of the Irish economy are inextricably linked to the global economy.  When I was studying economics in college, companies like Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns and AIG, were world leaders in their field.  Today, Lehman Brothers is no more, AIG has been rescued by the US Government, Bank of America has taken over Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns has merged with JP Morgan.  Events such as these would have been unthinkable just a few short months ago.  The bottom line is that there are no certainties anymore either for the global economy or for the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>However, unlike many of our European neighbours, we have entered this so-called &ldquo;economic perfect storm&rdquo; in a comparatively good position.  As a country, we have come through a period of remarkable economic growth.  No one can question that as a country we have made tremendous strides on the back of the economic boom of the past decade or so.  The Ireland of 2008 bears no resemblance to the Ireland of the 1980s, despite what some commentators and even politicians might wish to portray.  Contrary to the Opposition motion before us today, it is clear that fruits of this boom have been put to good use.</P>
        <P>We have seen a dramatic reduction in the national debt as a percentage of our economic output.  The Government has established a pensions reserve fund to provide for future pension liabilities.  We significantly increased investment in public services with more garda&iacute;, teachers, and health professionals than ever in the country&rsquo;s history.  In addition, we have rolled out an enormous programme of capital investment to improve the country&rsquo;s infrastructure.  However, that is not to underestimate the challenge before us, which is immense.  We can exercise no influence over some of the determinants of our economic performance.  Exchange rates which have been unfavourable for exports with the weak sterling and US dollar, interest rates now set by the ECB, and oil and commodity prices, to name but a few, are all important instruments outside our control.</P>
        <P>At a time when all the external factors are unfavourable, it is even more important that we manage well those factors under our control.  Public sector pay and private sector pay to a lesser extent must be kept under control.  I congratulate the Government and social partners on achieving a draft national wage agreement in recent weeks.  I hope the various unions will support the draft agreement so that it can be implemented.  We can control our taxation policy and the parameters of public expenditure.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment, which he reiterated last night, to weed out any examples of inefficient spending and poor value for money in the public sector.  The recently published report of the Comptroller and Auditor <Col N="889"/>General highlighted a number of such incidents that must be addressed urgently.  It is important that we also continue to pursue a strategy of managing inflationary pressures in our economy.</P>
        <P>The Government has taken control of the situation and has made a number of important decisions in recent weeks.  Savings of &euro;440 million are being implemented up to the end of this year, which only represents a start.  The deposit guarantee scheme has been increased to 100% up to a value of &euro;100,000 to restore confidence in the banking sector.  This decision was essential in recent days when considerable uncertainty had emerged in the media regarding the stability of the banks and the Minister acted decisively and underlined the strong capital base and liquidity of the Irish banking system which is quite distinct from the US system in terms of the retail banks here.  Most important of all, budget day has been brought forward to 14 October.</P>
        <P>The next three weeks provide the Opposition with a glorious opportunity to present a full budget as an alternative to the Government&rsquo;s.  It should flesh out the details and show us its proposed expenditure, the areas it would cut and the areas it would prioritise.  The budget next month will undoubtedly prove to be one of the most difficult that any Government has had to introduce in recent years.  Difficult decisions will need to be made and we cannot be all things to all people.  Public expenditure will need to be seriously restrained.  While we have a low debt to GDP ratio that allows us to borrow for capital purposes, it is an unsustainable position for any Government to borrow to cover current expenditure.  I am sure the Minister will ensure we do not pursue such a course of action.  I am sure there will be a number of initiatives to stimulate the economy.</P>
        <P>Agencies that are not performing or whose functions are unclear or overlap with others should be sacrificed.  It is my view that much of the work performed by agencies should be brought back into Departments under direct ministerial control.  The primacy of Government and the elected Member should be restored in our democracy, and this is the time to do it.  The public now have an appetite for reform.  They know that unpalatable decisions will be taken and sacrifices will need to be made, and I believe they will support the Government in the steps that will need to be taken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to place even more emphasis on entrepreneurs and start-up businesses, with the formation of a specific business start-up incentive package.  The types of incentives could include an exemption from local authority rates for a two-year period, a discount on electricity and energy supply for a defined period, and greater assistance in achieving compliance with revenue and regulatory requirements.</P>
        <P>It is important that the State would treat people who have lost their jobs in recent weeks compassionately and that every arm of the State would make every possible effort to support them in their hour of need.  I have full confidence that the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has the ability and the courage to introduce the measures required in the next budget.  On this side of the House, he will have our full support.</P>

	<P>Last night the Minister for Finance told us he welcomed a debate on the economy and asked us not to engage in dishonesty or misrepresentation.  I agree with those sentiments and it is in that spirit that I will make my contribution today.  The economic crisis Ireland is facing has two features, first, the recession; and, second, the precipitous deterioration in our public finances.  I will deal with the recession first.  This year we will have the first year of negative growth after 23 years of growth, some of which have had major growth and others had small amounts of growth.  For the first time in 23 years we are in recession; the economy <Col N="890"/>is shrinking and will do so again next year.  We have also seen the precipitous deterioration in the public finances with the worst turnaround in the history of the State going from a budget surplus to a massive deficit and a very likely public sector borrowing requirement of &euro;10 billion this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding the recession the Government&rsquo;s narrative seems to be simple &mdash; it is all down to international factors as we have heard again today.  They say that commodity prices are increasing, the credit crunch is affecting borrowing and the financial markets are in turmoil.  From the way they speak one would believe the banks collapsed last year rather than last week.  While international factors are at play, Ireland is not the only country affected by international factors.  The fair and reasonable question to ask is why Ireland is faring much worse in this scenario.  Why is Ireland the only eurozone country that will breach the 3% borrowing limit this year?  Why is it, according to the intelligence unit of <i>The Economist</i>, that out of the 56 largest economies in the world Ireland is one of only two that will be in recession this year?  Why is Ireland the only economy that will be in recession next year?  Why do the USA, Japan, United Kingdom, Germany and France still have moderate growth this year?  Why did China and India still grow at 10%, Russia at 7%, Africa at 6%, and South America at 7%?  Why will the world economy still grow by 4% this year?  Why are the international factors affecting Ireland so differently?  Why is unemployment increasing in Ireland when, according to Eurostat last month, it is decreasing in the EU?  Why has Ireland overtaken the US, United Kingdom, Japan, Britain, Austria, Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Czech Republic, Sweden, Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand and Israel in terms of unemployment?  Why will Ireland overtake the EU average in unemployment in the coming year?  The question that has to be asked is simple.  Why is Ireland, a country that boasted about outperforming the international economy for the past ten years, the dunce in the class and the economy that is faring worst?  The answer is simple, it is domestic factors.  In his contribution, Deputy Michael Ahern told us that Deputies should have regard to the facts when quoting figures, and I agree.  Let us examine the facts.</P>
        <P>Last year the economy grew by 6%, this year it will not grow at all.  For every 10,000 houses built, that is 1% of GDP.  Some 85,000 houses were built last year and 45,000 were built this year.  Therefore, four out of the six points we have lost in growth are due to the housing bubble that was not created by Merrill Lynch or Lehman Brothers but by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It was done by allowing 100% mortgages, 40 year mortgages and tinkering with stamp duty.</P>
        <P>In his contribution, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told the House that Fine Gael destabilised the market through half-baked ill-conceived proposals to reform stamp duty.  We did not destabilise the market.  The Government destabilised the market.  Mr. Michael McDowell said we did not need stamp duty.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, said we would not have any reform.  Then he introduced reform after the general election and another reform, which was more or less what we proposed, six months later.  The Government destabilised the market not Fine Gael.  The Government gave tax breaks to developers at a time when it should have been trying to rein in construction, poured cash into an economy which was already overheating and increased mortgage interest relief tax credits, which is essentially a mortgage subsidy.  The Government did this and should be honest about it and accept it.  It ignored all the warnings from Deputy Richard Bruton, Deputy Joan Burton, the IMF and the Central Bank.  If there is blame to be had in this crisis, 20% may be due to international factors and 80% is due to Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Government took a Celtic tiger that was based on competitiveness and export driven growth after five years and replaced it, after 2002, with a septic tiger, based on cheap credit and borrowed money.  That is the reason we are in this mess.  I accept there are international factors at play and that next year the US, United Kingdom and <Col N="891"/>Japan may go into recession.  Next year we will feel the bite of those international factors and it will get much worse, thanks to the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The public finances need to be examined.  Why have we seen the worst turnaround in the history of the State?  Why will the Government borrow &euro;10 billion this year?  Deputy Thomas Byrne and some of the other Deputies opposite mentioned that as a proportion of national debt the percentage of GDP has fallen to 23%.  That is a good thing and a genuine achievement.  The reality is that the Government will borrow &euro;10 billion this year, probably &euro;10 billion next year, perhaps &euro;7 billion the year after and &euro;6 billion the year after.  That is if we are lucky.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will double the national debt.  Where has one heard that before?  When the Minister is sitting on the Opposition benches in 2011, as Leader of the Opposition, we will remind him that he was the second Minister for Finance in a generation to double the national debt.  I will enjoy doing that.</P>
        <P>This year the Government will issue bonds and borrow &euro;10 billion.  That money will come from China and Arab cashflows.  Essentially we will borrow &euro;10 billion this year to pay teachers, nurses and garda&iacute;.  What is worse is that we will borrow that Chinese and Arab money to buy back from them their oil and cheap toys for Christmas.</P>
        <P>International factors have not caused the deficit.  The two reasons for the deficit are that the Government used unsustainable tax revenues from the housing bubble to fund the economy for years and its reckless spending whereby the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, increased spending at twice the rate of growth in the economy for five years.  Anyone, whether they have studied economics, knows that is not a sustainable economic policy.  It is reckless.  Let us take the contrast of Spain.  Spain is also an open economy, it is globalised and is affected by international factors and it also had a housing bubble but it will not go into recession this year because it has a competent government that prepared for the downturn.  Our Government did not prepare for the downturn.  It should have built up a surplus but did not, hence the reason for the mess.  It should have invested in the future and in infrastructure.  It had no plan whatsoever.  When things started to go wrong, instead of having a plan, it got angry and blamed other people, for example, David McWilliams, Joe Duffy and whoever it could find.  After that it was in denial and said nothing was wrong, that the fundamentals of the economy were sound.  It was going on holidays, everything was fine but now it has come back and there is panic.</P>
        <P>Some of the contributions last night by speakers opposite deserve a response.  The Minister for Finance accused Fine Gael of making political hay from the current economic crisis.  That argument would have had more credibility if Fianna F&aacute;il and Members opposite had not used the international boom of the past ten years as political hay and claimed credit for everything good that happened, whether it was of its creation or not.  It appears the Ministers and Members opposite speak with two faces.  They look back on the past ten years and claim credit for everything good that happened and look at the present and then forward to the next few years and absolve themselves of any responsibility.</P>
        <P>Last night the Minister for Finance told the House that loose lips sink ships and that in current economic times loose lips may sink a bank.  That may be credible but it came from a Minister who stood at a meeting of international investors and international developers and told them he had the misfortune to be the Minister for Finance.  He told them that our economy was coming to a shuddering halt.  The arrogance and the hypocrisy is hard to understand.  This was the same Minister for Finance who last night suggested Deputy Bruton should rein in some members of Fine Gael.  He appealed to Deputy Bruton to rein in the worst excesses of those in the party who in the pursuit of political advantage are undermining confidence in the economy.  He was probably referring to somebody like me in that regard.  Yet what has he to say about the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, <Col N="892"/>who in July told the House we were facing an economic crisis, the likes of which we have not seen in 20 years?  That came from a Minister in the Government.</P>
        <P>What about the different messages being sent out on the economy.  On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan, said the Government would intervene in the housing market to help out first-time buyers.  That afternoon, the Minister for Finance said it would not.  Mr. Michael McDowell said we did not need stamp duty.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, said there would be no reform but there was reform.  There were also the mixed messages from the Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste in regard to public sector reform.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the calls for honesty and accurate presentations from the Minister for Finance.  Let us have truth from the Government.  If it is truthful it will get more respect for it in the long run.  This is not a downturn, it is a recession and one that will turn into a slump.  The medium-term prospects are not good, they are uncertain.  The problems that occur in the economy are caused by international and domestic factors.  Primarily they are caused by domestic factors and the international factors have yet to kick in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fundamentals of the economy are not sound.  Unemployment, inflation and competitiveness are all bad.  The only thing that is good is the national debt and the Government intends to double it.  There is no silver bullet to solve the economic crisis, what is needed is recovery through reform.  I draw the attention of Members opposite, Deputy Calleary in particular, who clearly is very ignorant, to the three policy documents on our website, streamlining Government, recovery through reform and our VAT reforms.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>What is taking place in the House this week is very important.  It has illustrated in a very stark way the extent to which the Government is out of touch.  It is extraordinary after a recess of three months that we return to the House in the midst of the greatest economic crisis since the 1930s to discover a Government that gives priority on the agenda of this House to two issues.  They are a double taxation agreement between the Isle of Man, Macedonia, Vietnam and this State, a matter of no great urgency, and legislation on the constituency boundaries with the intent that Members ignore the economic crisis and engage in political naval gazing.  We have an arrogant, self-centred, incompetent Government, bereft of any notion of the impact of what is happening on people outside this House and incapable of understanding democratic accountability.  On occasion, it calls for a bipartisan approach.  How can one have bipartisanship on economic issues, in circumstances where the Government cannot agree to set aside reasonable time for debate on the economy?  The truth is that if there was no Fine Gael motion in Private Members&rsquo; time on the economy, after a three month recess the economic crisis with which we are confronted would not have been discussed at all.  The Government&rsquo;s call for bipartisanship is nothing more than political grandstanding and old style cute hoor Fianna F&aacute;il politics.  Its concept of bipartisanship is that the Opposition should endorse without criticism whatever unilateral decisions the Government makes.  This is not about the public good or democratic principle, this is a call for loyalty and obedience to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in government and the Green Party-Progressive Democrats slipstream in its wake.  There is a whiff of cordite implicit in the call because it involves a threat, namely: &ldquo;If you do not support what we say we will accuse you of being responsible for what we have done.&rdquo;  This is the Sopranos approach to politics.</P>
     
        <P>There are people outside this House who have not experienced recession during their adult lives while there are others who lived through the recession created by the unprecedented irresponsible level of public expenditure by a Fianna F&aacute;il government in the second half of the <Col N="893"/>1970s.  There are people outside this House today who are hurting as they face unprecedented job losses, while those in jobs lack security.  Multinational companies have established here but it is uncertain whether they will go or stay.  Hundreds, if not thousands of homeowners are experiencing negative equity.  There are more foreclosures than we have known in three decades, with at least one house per week being repossessed through the courts, and it is inevitable that there will be further foreclosures in the coming months.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The scale of claims for unemployment benefit are so high that the Department of Social and Family Affairs which administers the scheme cannot cope with the pressures.  A lack of liquidity in markets places at risk viable successful businesses that need to access funds within a reasonable time but cannot do so.  A stock market collapse impacts not only on the super rich but on the small investor.  It has decimated pension funds and has created a real problem for large firms and some State bodies with defined benefit schemes.  These will only have the capacity to pay pensions if the stock markets and the value of pension funds recover.  There are such funds today worth 20% less than they were worth this time last year.</P>
        <P>On their own all these issues demanded that the Government should order time to debate the economy.  Within a few days of this D&aacute;il reconvening we have had, in addition, the social partnership agreement.  Serious questions arise about that agreement.  Can we afford a 5.5% increase in public sector pay in the final ten months of this 21-month agreement?  Can private industry and the retail sector now afford a 3.5% increase in wages?  Should wages across the public and private sectors, except for those on low pay, not have been frozen for a period of 12 or 18 months?  The social partners might then have reconvened after the fog had lifted and there was a clear perspective of where the economy was heading.  Should job security not have been a priority instead of wage increases?  All these issues demanded that the Government order time for debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My colleague, Deputy Varadkar, eloquently illustrated that the difficulties we confront are not of a global nature alone but are domestically created.  The four budgets which the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, presented as Minister for Finance and the huge unsustainable increase in current expenditure authorised under his stewardship will in years to come be seen as an ill-advised unmitigated disaster.  The disaster is compounded by the bizarre paralysis and indecision that descended on the Government during the four months since Deputy Cowen assumed the office of Taoiseach.  Under the stewardship of Deputy Cowen, as Minister for Finance and as Taoiseach, the Government has clung to bad policies the way Mr. Magoo might cling to a lamp post, not to see clearly but to keep himself on his feet as he blindly staggers into an open manhole.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The baton of financial incompetence is now held by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  The Taoiseach and the Government fail to recognise and acknowledge that decisions they have taken have dramatically contributed to this State&rsquo;s economic downturn.  If they cling to the delusion that global factors are the only reason for our difficulties, we are in even greater trouble.  The foolish and ill-advised speech of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, last night gives no cause for confidence.  It clearly illustrates, however, the Government&rsquo;s unsuitability for office.  The Minister said the rapid deterioration in our economy and the speed with which international factors have impacted on us have taken everybody by surprise.  The credit crunch has existed for over a year.  The crisis arising from sub-prime borrowing in the United States has been whistling through the banking sector for approximately 15 months.  The collapse of property markets in the United States, whose property bubble was a mirror image of ours, commenced two years ago.  The strengthening of the euro against the dollar started four years ago.  The fact that it continued so was inevitable in the context of the insane economic policies of the Bush Administration and the dramatic growth in US budget deficits.</P><Col N="894"/>
        <P>The Government, however, ignored all the signs and ploughed on regardless, with unprecedented levels of spending, a total failure to reform the public sector and massive wastage of public funds, ably and annually illustrated by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It retained a commitment and dedication to pork barrel politics.  A particular example of this is the politically inspired, ill thought out decentralisation programme whose principal objective was to move State agencies and Departments from Dublin to ministerial constituencies in the hope of shoring up and increasing ministerial votes.</P>
        <P>The biggest scandal of all is the Government&rsquo;s failure to act to deal with the housing bubble.  Instead of popping it at an early stage the Government allowed the bubble to attain its full spherical shimmer.  This was not negligence but reckless governmental policy and fraudulent political trading.  The Government&rsquo;s vested interest in allowing the bubble to grow was evidenced by Ministers accusing anyone who spoke about the property bubble of national treachery.  The property bubble was allowed to grow because it increased house prices and the Government had its snout in the trough of stamp duty.  This situation facilitated the Government in making easy decisions to spend whatever money came to hand, whenever it suited, without having to display any level of political responsibility.</P>
        <P>Last night the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, spoke of a sharp correction in the housing market and corresponding processes of adjustment.  The reality is the Government should have called in the banks four years ago and stopped them providing 100% loans or repayment terms of 40 years.  It should have brought spiralling land prices under control because it had a duty in that regard.  The Central Bank, as a regulatory authority, also had that duty.  The Government and the Central Bank abdicated that responsibility because of the benefits gained from stamp duty expenditure.</P>
        <P>Last night the Minister spoke of those who criticise Government policy as undermining confidence in the economy.  It is the Government&rsquo;s incompetence, paralysis and ineptitude that are doing this damage.  The last refuge of a political scoundrel, bereft of ideas, is to label his critics and political opponents as unpatriotic.  Last night the Minister attempted to wrap the green flag around himself and accuse critics of political treachery.  The truth is the Government wanted no debate on the economy because it has no economic policy.  The party that proclaimed to the electorate that it had a safe pair of economic hands is now, like the emperor of fable, exposed and seen to have no clothing.  For the past four months it has played a game of economic roulette, hoping that one last spin of the political wheel would extricate it from its plight and remove this country from the malaise created by Government policy.

      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>For the past decade we have been led by a dishonest Government whose only real triumph has been the triumph of perception over substance.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Ahern, yesterday wailed and moaned about not being able to attend a Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels.  However, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, he did not attend the last Council of Ministers meeting before the Lisbon treaty referendum, which he should have attended.  In fact, no politician from that Department attended the meeting.  Ireland was the only country in the European Union that did not send a politician from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I understand that he has not attended the last two Council of Ministers meetings in Brussels and he may wish to share his reasons for failing to do so with the House, in view of the new found interest he espoused yesterday.</P>
        <P>We are used to the term &ldquo;as safe as the Bank of England&rdquo; but that term is no longer with us.  We may examine our own lives for tangible evidence of the economic slump in Ireland and <Col N="895"/>I found it yesterday when I left home at 6.30 a.m.  I would normally arrive in Dublin at around 8.15 a.m. but I was here by 7.40 a.m., some 35 minutes earlier than usual.  Why was this the case?  It was because there were no trucks on the road and very little traffic.  It was not because this Government has come up with a great new public transport system &mdash; if anything public transport has deteriorated.  It was because economic activity has come to a standstill on this Government&rsquo;s watch.  Like the trout in the bucket of milk, it is not a case of &ldquo;we are where we are&rdquo;, but rather &ldquo;how did we get here and how will we fix the situation&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>If this Government was on Wall Street it would be in liquidation by now &mdash; it is bankrupt in everything but name.  FF stands for Freddie Mac and Fanny Mae, Fianna F&aacute;il and freefall.  This economy has been in freefall for some years thanks to this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  For a political generation the Government surfed the construction boom and the global economy, spent money like a drunken sailor and carried out no reforms.  The Government watched as our competitiveness tumbled and no thought went into expenditure.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, last night spoke of the &euro;30 billion that has been spent on public infrastructure over this period but I guarantee that in the next decade many bestsellers will be based on that &euro;30 billion and I look forward to their publication.  The situation is epitomised by the kiosk on the front lawn of Leinster House.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh, represents the Department responsible for this and I hope he will initiate an investigation into how the glass box kiosk cost over &euro;1 million.  It defies logic and it has happened in front of the Minister of State&rsquo;s eyes.  I sincerely hope that one of the first things the Minister of State will do is look into how the money was spent.</P>
        <P>It is not as though the Government was not warned about all of this:</P>
        <P LI="1">There is a worrying complacency in Government about our enterprise sector.  In the last four years employment in the exposed sector of our economy has been in decline.  The rate of job loss has been more than double the rate of the mid 90s.  Dramatic acceleration in the growth of public service employment and payroll costs has forced up taxation.  Meanwhile the average price of exports since May 2002 has fallen by 15%.  It is not enough to live off past successes and ignore the emerging challenges.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Those words were spoken in December 2004 by Deputy Richard Bruton during his budget speech.  Where were the members of the Government parties at that point?  They were in the D&aacute;il bar and on the plinth, slapping one another on their backs for the great job they were doing on the back of the construction boom and the global economy.  However, now the Government claims it is not responsible for the downturn &mdash; it takes credit but not flak.  The things the Government can do have been outlined in the document &ldquo;Recovery through Reform&rdquo; and Deputy Varadkar has outlined how this can be accessed.</P>
        <P>The Government must publish the unedited version of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report on the reform of public transport.  It has been quoted to support certain policies but people do not have confidence in it and want to see the unedited version.  Indeed, people do not have confidence in this Government.  We need a comprehensive analysis of proposals, not a fire brigade approach.  I commend this motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I have heard, during this debate, the opening statements of many speakers mention that we are in the midst of an international crisis.  The global downturn has been cited as the reason for this economy suffering so badly at the moment.  It is true that we are in the midst of an international crisis but that crisis did not exist last year or the year before.  In 2006 the Exchequer had a &euro;2 billion surplus but by 2007 that had become a &euro;1.6 billion deficit and this demonstrates how much of this downturn or recession is of the Government&rsquo;s making.</P><Col N="896"/>
        <P>People in Ireland are suffering today due to the serious financial situation we are in.  It is expected that 200 Tyco workers in Cork will be let go today and yesterday 150 lost their jobs.  Pfizer is letting go 180 workers and Harmon Electronics has let go 140 people in recent of months.  I do not mean to belittle these statistics because they are important to the individuals affected.  This morning ISME stated that small companies throughout the country are letting people go and we know this already.  There has been a huge downturn in the construction sector and it has had a serious effect on unemployment.  We all know stories relating to this difficult and uncertain situation which affects many people who look to the Government for direction.  However, the Government is not giving direction &mdash; it packed its bags at the end of July and went on holidays and then decided to hold the budget in the middle of October.  We are still waiting for direction from the Government and we still seek leadership on this matter.</P>
        <P>Last night Deputies Varadkar and Bruton outlined how Spain got its house in order, despite the fact that before the summer it would have been seen as vulnerable and heading for a recession, like Ireland, due to an over reliance on the property sector.  The Prime Minister of Spain called the Government back and asked its members to submit proposals to deal with the difficult economic situation.  It is now apparent that Spain is moving out of recession, but Ireland&rsquo;s Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance are still caught, like rabbits in headlights, without a plan and with no direction for the economy.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has put forward many proposals and I suggest that we seriously try to tackle the issue of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  This is a very expensive place to do business and I suspect this is why Tyco made its announcement today.  Ireland is expensive in terms of labour costs and energy costs &mdash; there is no competition in the energy sector.  This is an expensive country in terms of local authority charges, Government charges and the red tape with which companies must deal.  These are all excesses that create difficulties for companies that want to do business here.  Ireland is an expensive place to operate and its economy must become leaner and fitter.  The Government must provide direction and leadership on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the counter-motion put forward by the Government.  Our economic difficulties may have specific domestic characteristics, but they do not exist in isolation.  As a small, open economy external developments have a major impact and the global rise in commodity prices has contributed to an erosion of consumer spending power.  The appreciation in the exchange rate has also contributed to rising competitive pressures for our export sector, particularly in the context of sluggish demand in several of our major trading partners.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to draw Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s attention to a report in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> that says the eurozone is now in recession.  Some have tried to give the impression that only Ireland and one or two other countries are in recession but it is far wider than that.  This is all taking place against a backdrop of international financial market instability over the past year, particularly the past few weeks.  It is essential that the Government participates fully in global discussions and this is especially the case given the uncertainty created by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the Lisbon treaty referendum.  That referendum saw a person, exposed in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> as a neo-conservative warmonger, hijack a sector of Irish public opinion.</P>
        <P>On the domestic front, the ongoing adjustment of the house building sector to more sustainable levels of output is having a negative impact on the economy and employment.</P>
        <P>Following a decade and a half of solid expansion, these factors are placing considerable strains on the economy and are having a detrimental impact on the public finances and on employment.  At least, however, we are starting from a strong position all round.  Certainly, <Col N="897"/>even in a worst-case scenario, the national debt will be nowhere near the level of greater than 100% of GNP that it reached 22 years ago.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has taken four actions recently to address some of the difficulties.  First, it is bringing forward the budget to mid-October, following some of the economies announced in July.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a great help.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>This action reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide clear economic leadership and the need to safeguard the gains our country has made by ensuring responsibility and appropriate action in the management of the public finances.  The budget will seek to prioritise expenditure in the light of our changed budgetary position.  As such, it will give clarity and confidence to investors, taxpayers and citizens and will provide a sound basis for economic recovery when conditions make that possible.</P>
        <P>Second, last weekend the deposit guarantee limit in lending institutions was raised to &euro;100,000 to counter speculative pressures about the stability of those institutions and their effect on public confidence.  Third, a social partnership agreement has been concluded, although obviously it has yet to be ratified.  It has played a crucial role in the past 20 years in our economic performance.  If I may reply to Deputy Higgins, there is nothing neo-liberal about social partnership.  Were I to define my own economic philosophy, it would be republican-social democratic.  The fourth factor has been the introduction of fixed contracts in State infrastructural projects.</P>
        <P>Despite the picture being painted, the previous Minister for Finance and current Taoiseach phased out many property incentive schemes.  During and before the last election, many other parties were urging on the Government measures that would try to sustain the property boom which clearly was impossible.</P>
        <P>I do not have time to refer to the target of public procurement savings of &euro;50 million on which the Government is working to achieve and rationalise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and commend Deputy Bruton on tabling the motion.  Throughout the summer, we were told <i>ad nauseam</i> that a Tallaght strategy was needed in respect of the economy.  Last night, however, as Deputy Bruton was speaking in the House, four Ministers of State entered the Chamber during his contribution and three of them left.  Not a single representative of the Government was prepared to listen to what Deputy Bruton had to say.  This is disappointing because I note the Minister of State referred to the issue of protection for depositors.  Deputy Bruton proposed that measure on 1 October 2007.  It took almost 12 months for the Government to implement it and it did so when we were on the verge of a run on our banks.</P>
        <P>It is about time the Government began to take up a leadership role on the economy and dealt with issues that matter to Irish citizens.  Irish businesses are going to the wall at present and Irish people are losing their jobs on a daily basis.  Young families, who are mortgaged to the hilt, are feeling the brunt at present and the blame lies firmly with the Government.  In 2005, the current Taoiseach and then Minister for Finance was advised privately by economic experts that the explosion in property prices was unsustainable.  However, he publically encouraged young people to invest their future in housing.  Why was that?  One must remember that 35% of the house price ended up in the Government&rsquo;s coffers in taxes and charges of one form or another.  That constituted &euro;35,000 of every &euro;100,000 that was owed in mortgage repayments, many of which were mortgaged over a 40-year period.</P>
        <P>At present, many ordinary people are trying to make ends meet.  They must pay the bank to keep a roof over their heads, pay for cars and child care and must devote most of their income to household spending.  At present, many of my peers are going to community welfare officers for assistance with their interest payments because they do not wish to lose their homes, many of them having lost their jobs.  What is the Government&rsquo;s answer?  Its response is that after three months of idling and doing nothing, it would unveil a plan next month, which would be implemented in four months&rsquo; time.  The cost of living in the economy must be tackled.  Vulnerable employees must be upskilled.  The economy must be revolutionised by giving real power to the Competition Authority.  Competitiveness within the economy must be improved.  The economy must be reinvented and new opportunities must be created.</P>
        <P>Two years ago, the economy was experiencing a shortage of labour and we needed to try to fill those jobs.  There now is a shortage of jobs and we need people to come here to create jobs.  One way to do so is to tap into our immigrant communities, who have significant skills that are not being used properly within the economy at present.  Three steps could address this issue easily.  The first is to ensure that language courses are available for people.  Second, many of the individuals concerned have third level qualifications.  However, because such qualifications are not recognised in Ireland, they cannot use them.  We need to tap into those skills and make them available to the economy.  Third, we must deal with the issue of business permission.  Many immigrants who have come to Ireland have entrepreneurial skills.  However, because the law stipulates that they must invest a minimum of &euro;300,000, many of them do not have the opportunity to establish a business in Ireland.  A minor change in the law could facilitate and allow them to so do.  While there are many challenges, many solutions exist.  The difficulty is that the Government is not prepared to listen or to implement such proposals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the participation of Members in this debate.  I find it incredible that on the resumption of the D&aacute;il after the summer break, there would be no discussion on the economy or the economic circumstances facing Ireland were it not for the tabling by the Fine Gael Party of this Private Members&rsquo; motion.  It is equally incredible that successive Government speakers have followed the classic Fianna F&aacute;il line of blaming someone else without accepting responsibility for one&rsquo;s own actions or, in this case, inaction.  Everyone is aware <Col N="899"/>that the implications of global financial turmoil are under discussion.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party in government in Ireland is not responsible for Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns or the American sub-prime mortgage catastrophe.  However, it is responsible for dealing with affairs of the nation that are within its own control.</P>
        <P>Over the past ten years in particular, Fianna F&aacute;il did not heed any of the warning signs that were put up by both the Fine Gael Party and by reputable international financial indicators.  No measure was taken into account by Fianna F&aacute;il in government of what could happen.  When the division in the road came, having grown out of an export-led economy, in which trade in goods and services became the fundamental catalyst for development in Ireland, the Fianna F&aacute;il Government turned to the tent in Galway and built its economy on the back of property as the new wealth creator.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, might smile but that is the truth, unpalatable as he may find it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>His party&rsquo;s Government built its future and that of the nation on the backs of a construction industry and housing boom which clearly could not last.  Successive Government speakers ascribed the current woes in the economy to international factors.  They have lost sight of what government should be about.  It is about having balanced budgets, efficient governance, value for money, job protection and security and keeping inflation down.  The Government has failed on these fundamental issues.  We now have the worst Administration in 40 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the reasons it is the worst Administration in 40 years is that it consists of a Cabinet of individuals.  There is no coherence, competence or leadership in Cabinet at the moment.  That is the reason for absent Minister after absent Minister speaking about increasing the top rate of income tax and bringing in domestic water charges when 43% of the treated water in the country is flowing away through pipes underground.  Ministers float personal musings about introducing third-level fees when the Government has screwed an entire young generation for capital gains tax and stamp duty on their houses.  It now expects them to pay for their future also.</P>
        <P>This Government has turned into a Cabinet of kite flyers and wasters.  It is nothing more or less than the worst Administration in 40 years.</P>
        <P>The lack of regulation from the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator when banks were throwing out money prolifically left, right and centre has been pointed out time and again.  I have been in houses which young people have built for a fortune and furnished to the gills.  On top of the mortgage they throw in the BMW and SUV.  We even now have cases where credit cards have been exhausted and transferred on to a mortgage, with a subsequent increase in repayments.</P>
        <P>The level of personal debt in this country will take years to filter through the system.  The lack of comprehension that it could not last was fostered by Fianna F&aacute;il with the idea that the good times would never end and the party would last forever.  The Government failed absolutely and fundamentally to do its constitutional and political duty by having a country efficiently run with value for money.</P>
        <P>Why does it take a recession for Fianna F&aacute;il to indicate it must do something about the public service?  It is five years since we were down in Killarney and I stated that if &euro;1 billion extra was to be paid in benchmarking, we should ensure a return in increased efficiency and better service for the people from that money.  That choice was never taken up and the Fine <Col N="900"/>Gael Party was scoffed at for issuing these warnings.  We repeatedly offered warnings on social partnership and the dangerous trend emerging of the entire economy being built on the back of the property boom.</P>
        <P>In government, Fianna F&aacute;il would not listen and we are now expected to row in with the Government on all issues.  This example of a bipartisan approach which the Government sought on cancer services and so many other issues was not evident this week when it would not even have a debate on the economic circumstances in which our people now find themselves.</P>

	<P>It does not even practise what it preaches and it breaks its word and contract.  The programme for Government is in shreds and cannot be implemented in the way the Government said it would.</P>
        <P>Behind the economic statistics, there are human factors.  Some 300,000 people will shortly be on the live register.  Some 23 other EU countries have falling unemployment rates so why is it that Ireland is going in the opposite direction with a serious increase in unemployment and the numbers on the live register?  These are the human factors behind the economic statistics and we will find much social pain and disruption in the period ahead.  The Government has allowed the country to be built on the back of a property boom that could not last.</P>
        <P>We are now over-retailed to the point that many people have moved into large shopping malls with the inducement of two years of free rent.  These people are finding the capacity is not there any more because the retail sector has become over-pressurised.  We must get back to the fundamental economic issue &mdash; that this is an island country which makes money by exporting goods and services but we have lost our competitiveness in that regard.</P>
        <P>Money set aside in the programme for Government for opening up next generation broadband has never materialised.  There is &euro;200 million in the programme for Government for IT in the schools, where the future generation of engineers, entrepreneurs, businesspeople, housewives etc. will emerge from, but they are put at a distinct disadvantage by taking even that money away.</P>

	<P>How in heaven&rsquo;s name does the Government expect this young generation coming through the primary and secondary system to measure up to its peers when the Government has failed to provide the necessary competitive tools, such as broadband and next-generation communication bandwidth, to our schools?</P>
        <P>As has been pointed out in recent programmes, many businesses around the country suffer from an inferior capacity with regard to broadband.  We cannot do business internationally if we do not get that right.</P>
        <P>I would like to see Fianna F&aacute;il for once take heed of Opposition speakers.  In July we pointed out through the party&rsquo;s financial spokesman, Deputy Richard Bruton, a series of roadmaps and points on these which the Government could usefully follow to begin to restore this economy to a competitive level, where we can again face the future with some degree of hope and optimism.</P>
        <P>I recall being in this House, as the Ceann Comhairle does, in the mid 1980s.  He was not just a mild-mannered young Deputy from Kerry in those days because he and his colleagues had a chance in Opposition when Government difficulties were evident to make their points very vociferously.  Fine Gael will not shirk its responsibility of holding the Government to account <Col N="901"/>in this House.  The elected Government has a responsibility to govern effectively but it is not doing this.  It is a Cabinet of kite flyers and wasters.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We will live up to our responsibility to prosecute the Government and its absent Ministers in this House on the programme it is supposed to implement.  If the Government carries through issues in the budget on 14 October that have been put forward by the Fine Gael Party, we will support them in the House.  The Government belatedly introduced protection for deposits and small savings in banks and we support that.  Although it was a belated decision, where credit is due it will be given.  On the other hand, if the Government wants a bipartisan approach to dealing with the country, it could at least take on board some of the fundamental economically and socially sound proposals which have come from the Fine Gael Party.</P>
        <P>I welcome this debate.  It has taken the Fine Gael Party, on this first week after the summer recess, to have an economic discussion.  There was much blather from Ministers about disrupting the business of government.  If the Government wants a bipartisan approach, it should implement it.  It should have had its own debate over two and a half days on the economy so all Deputies could paint the pictures coming from their offices and clinics every week, with unemployment rising and social pressures on so many people.</P>

    <Title>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy Cyprian Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the Bill is to implement the recommendations of the Constituency Commission with regard to D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies and to revise the procedures to be followed by future constituency commissions.  It also revises procedures for the nomination of non-party candidates in European and local elections, which worked well in the most recent general election.  The balance struck in the legislation is fair and equitable and will ensure that those who express an interest in running as Independent candidates in local and European elections will have the opportunity to do so.  The deposits involved are not prohibitive and applicants will have some choice as to the centre in which they stand.  This gives an opportunity to people interested in representing constituencies to put their names forward.</P>
        <P>Many Members have mentioned the effect boundary changes have in their constituencies.  The current situation is that the 166 Deputies in the D&aacute;il each represent approximately 25,541 people, well within the proposed guidelines.  According to the Constitution, there should be no less than one Deputy per 30,000 of the population and any future commission will have to take into account changes that have taken place.</P>
        <P>The demographics of our population have changed immensely in a short time.  In the past ten years there has been significant change in the demographics, particularly on the north side of the city.  These older areas, like developing areas, continue to develop and need investment in education and other areas.  Older and more settled areas continue to develop, particularly with the increase in the number of apartment complexes and small in-fill estates.  People often refer to one-off housing as a rural issue, but it is now common in urban areas.  The trend over <Col N="904"/>recent years has been for one-off housing to be built adjacent to existing houses, particularly in local authority areas where there has been an upsurge in the gardens of existing houses.  This has contributed to the change in population trends in these areas.  I have seen the effect apartment developments have had on old, settled areas and these are now young, vibrant and busy areas.  Population in such areas have increased and this has led to increased availability of services such as shops, restaurants and pubs.</P>
        <P>The reduction of the number of European Parliament seats in the Dublin constituency by one must be revisited as a result of the changes in population, particularly in the city.  I understand there are developing areas outside the city boundaries, but the continuing rate of growth of the population of the city must be taken into consideration.  The diminution of representation at European level must be given further attention.</P>
        <P>Since its initiation in 1979, the Constituency Commission has had an advisory role and it is established practice that its recommendations are accepted.  There is scope for change here.  Individual Deputies have explained the effects boundary changes have on how they represent the people in their areas and how those people react to the changes.  I had experience of this prior to 1997 when the most natural boundary in the country, the River Liffey, was breached and my constituency took in part of the south side of the city, Ballyfermot and Cherry Orchard, areas with no relationship with Cabra and Glasnevin.  Although we are all Dubs, I believe Dublin is made up of a series of small villages.  I see this in my constituency and have noticed that people are proud of their community.  They are involved in their local parish or community and take pride in that.  When a change such as the one mentioned occurs, it is difficult for a public representative to explain that because a person is on one side of the road, he or she must be referred to another Deputy or councillor.  This causes confusion.</P>
        <P>To further add to the confusion, sometimes successive commissions decide change is needed and areas that were changed by a previous commission are reviewed and a further change takes place.  This means representatives must explain to people they are moved again.  This can interfere with the ability of people to vote.  It creates a fragile situation and hampers their privilege to cast their vote for particular individuals or parties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The serious and important issues dealt with in the Bill are sacrosanct to the way we implement democracy.  There are proposals in the Bill relating to how the commission does its business and it can now use the preliminary report of a census, rather than wait for the detailed results of the final census report.  That provision will make it easier and quicker for sitting and potential representatives to assimilate changes.  In my area the commission made no changes to our boundaries in the case of local elections nor does it make any change to the boundaries of Dublin Central.  Therefore, it makes no impact on my area.</P>
        <P>I listened however to a different story from representatives from Leitrim, Meath, Kerry and Limerick and these stories help us understand the problems of local representatives in those areas.  I listened to Deputy Johnny Brady last night.  He gave 34 years in an area serving the needs of the people there, but has to explain to them that he will no longer represent them, but now represents people just a few fields away as the result of the change in the boundary.  It is very difficult to explain this to people.</P>
        <P>I welcome the changes with regard to Independent candidates putting their names forward.  Those changes will make a difference.  We want to avoid the situation that exists in the UK, where comical candidates put their names forward.  These candidates have absolutely no representation but because of the system, they manage to put their names forward for whatever crazy party name they invent.  We have to protect ourselves from that because this is a relatively small democracy.</P><Col N="905"/>
        <P>Any change we make to our electoral system must be treated with respect and dignity.  We are a modern, vibrant and economically progressive country and we now have many new communities joining our society.  Our population is increasing year on year.  We have to protect what has gone before and this Bill will help.  Other issues, such as the register of electors, can be addressed but I welcome the Bill and wish it speedy progress.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, although I would prefer to spend the time discussing the state of the economy and the pressures facing individuals and institutions.  Economic issues have an influence on the movement of people towards the eastern part of the country rather than western and north-western areas.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Houses of the Oireachtas opened a stand at this year&rsquo;s National Ploughing Championships.  It is a major event and we were fortunate in having had the Ceann Comhairle officially open the stand on Tuesday.  There was great interest in it and it is important that people are informed of the workings of this House.  I wish those involved well in their visits to schools and other places throughout the rest of the year.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008, I welcome the fact that there is no change in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan but I am appalled that a further two counties, Longford and Westmeath, have been added to the North West European Parliament constituency, to which County Clare was already added in the previous election.  This has been brought about as a result of the failure of Government to provide the infrastructure and jobs needed in the north west to retain and increase the population.  Even the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme was a total disaster and has now been abandoned.  It is unlikely that any one party will get more than one seat in the new North West constituency, which means that each MEP will have to cover an area from Malinhead to the Shannon estuary and from Connemara to the stony grey soil of Inniskeen.  That is an impossible project.  Governments of whatever kind must look seriously at injecting the necessary support structures into the north and west so as to maintain and increase the population base in those areas rather than continuing the present Government&rsquo;s insistence on making all investments on the east coast.</P>
        <P>This brings me back to my situation in Cavan-Monaghan.  According to statistics and the information provided by the independent commission dealing with this revision, my constituency is close to the bottom in terms of the retention of five seats based strictly on the county boundaries of Cavan-Monaghan.  The commission can do nothing in that regard because it must go by the figures in front of it.  However, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and the Government have a major role to play in ensuring that the population of the Cavan-Monaghan region is not only retained but also increased.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s decision to intervene in the county development plan for County Monaghan, which was clearly based on the advice he was given, has implications for the potential population growth of the county.  It was clear from the letter sent in his name that he had never read it because it stated on the first page that he had made decisions on issues regarding County Monaghan in January 2007, even though he was then a humble Green Party spokesperson and not a Minister.  While I have some sympathy with his letter dealing with some of the expansion programmes for villages, his decision to restrict planning in areas of the county that were not classified as CL&Aacute;R is unforgivable.  A friend of mine spent &euro;10,000 on a planning application which should have been granted by the middle of the following week but was blocked by the Minister&rsquo;s outburst on a Sunday evening that declared planning permission for his site was <Col N="906"/>restricted to people living in the immediate area.  He has lived only one mile outside this area for most of his married life.</P>
        <P>It is encouraging that the people of Monaghan should be able to build houses under normal planning regulations in any part of the county where depopulation has been a scourge.  The border counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Donegal have suffered more than most as a result of the Northern Ireland troubles.  Governments have failed to provide inward investment into the area and if the peace process is to mean anything, the Government, particularly the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, must ensure that the commitment of the previous Taoiseach to increase investment is delivered and that high technology jobs are created.</P>
        <P>The failure of the Government to deliver on its decentralisation project is a serious cause of concern.  Some 80 Department of Social and Family Affairs jobs were committed to Carrickmacross and, in fairness to the staff and management of Monaghan County Council, every effort was made to provide accommodation.  Unfortunately, however, the project was held up as a result of party political resistance and the enthusiastic private investor pulled out in frustration.  These jobs in Carrickmacross, which were over-subscribed by people who wanted to move home or into the area, would have maintained or increased our population.  Similarly, 350 jobs were destined for Cavan and would not only have benefited the Cavan area in terms of population but would also have utilised many of the unused housing developments currently available.  While I appreciate these issues may not be directly relevant to the Bill before us, I raise them as examples of the Government&rsquo;s failure to maintain or increase populations in difficult rural northern and western areas.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with the people named by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, as members of the present revision commission because they have a job to do.  However, unless the Government takes action to increase its involvement in the development in areas outside of what was originally known as the Pale, more and more Deputies will come from the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Another issue of concern to rural dwellers in many parts of my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan is the failure of the Government to provide proper broadband facilities.  It is extremely important in this day and age that people, even those based in Dublin, are able to work in their home areas.  This would not only cut down on time wasted travelling morning and night to the city centre but it would also bring a major benefit to our environment by cutting down on carbon emissions.  However, not even certain major companies have hopes of getting broadband at present.</P>
        <P>The decision of the commission to increase seat numbers in some Dublin constituencies will provide opportunities for new people to get elected.  I wish them well but I can understand the frustration of people in areas like D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Limerick City and others where the number of seats has been reduced from five to four, meaning that some of the city members must lose or go elsewhere.</P>
        <P>A similar situation has occurred within my own constituency in respect of the county council elections, where some individuals have lost their immediate electoral base and will find themselves under tremendous pressure.  While the Cavan-Monaghan constituency will be retained under the Bill, I have first-hand knowledge of how much pressure a change of boundaries can cause to individual politicians and their families.</P>
        <P>While we accept the decisions of independent commissions, it is sometimes very hard to see their logic.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments to the effect that he wished to hold more consultations.  It is vital that there be consultations on the ground, in addition to looking at maps in Dublin, so that simple logic can prevail.  When one area is shown as a long stripe and <Col N="907"/>others only cover small areas, one has to question the thinking of the commission.  The numbers may add up, but the process could be carried out in a different way.</P>
        <P>The use of an independent commission is the best way to carry out this exercise and I support the Bill in principle in the knowledge that my party spokesperson will table amendments, which I hope will be accepted in a constructive way.  I wish the Minister well but it is vital that, in the interests of democracy and fair play, when reasonable amendments are tabled they are not blocked for the sake of opposition.  I urge the Minister to listen to constructive amendments to make this Bill worthwhile.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>My party supports the Bill but I do not welcome it because it is based on a flawed commission report which was carelessly drafted.  In future reports the relevant commission should be asked to justify the decisions it makes and not be allowed to hand them down as diktats.  The logic of some of the decisions in the report is hard to understand.  It is inequitable and flawed.  The report is careless but the commission arrived at its conclusion and knows that the practice in the D&aacute;il is to accept what the commission decides.  If there are other reports like this, that practice itself could break down.</P>
        <P>Over the years commissions have adopted two different approaches to constituency changes.  One approach involves small changes with knock-on effects for every constituency in the country but which do not discommode many people.  The other approach is where one boundary goes free and this report is in that category, being based on two large initiatives with everything else built around them.  The two large initiatives were to suppress one seat in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and one seat in County Limerick, giving two additional seats which could be applied to the new population areas in west and north Dublin.</P>
        <P>I accept the approach because it has been adopted before but I wish to examine the situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Kerry and Limerick, which affects me personally.  County Limerick is losing a seat.  We had eight seats, one five-seater and one three-seater, but we will now have a four-seat city and a three-seat county, whereas Kerry is holding onto its six seats.  If the plan was to change the boundaries between Limerick and Kerry, I would question its logic.  The changes are being made by people who must be totally unfamiliar with both counties and they have discommoded many people.  Many ordinary voters and political activists are extremely unhappy that a whole tranche of the county, from Abbeyfeale down to the Shannon estuary at Glin, is being transferred to Kerry.  They are extremely unhappy that a tranche of the Castleconnell electoral area of east Limerick is going into what used to be Limerick West and will now be Limerick County.</P>
        <P>Obviously, when populations change constituencies have to change and the report of the commission provides statistics in that connection.  In 2006, Kerry North had 23,148 persons per D&aacute;il Deputy and Kerry South had 23,464.  Limerick East had 23,647 and Limerick West had 23,733 so Kerry was further from qualifying for six seats than Limerick was from qualifying for eight.  One of the major bases for the change made by the commission was the record of current D&aacute;il constituencies ranked by percentage variance from the national average for population per Deputy, given in table one.  Limerick West stood at -7.08 relative to the average and Limerick East at -7.42, whereas Kerry South stood at -8.13 while Kerry North was at -9.37.  This would favour a transfer of population from Kerry to Limerick rather than <i>vice versa</i>, yet the commission flew in the face of its own evidence and recommended the opposite.</P>
        <P>The justification for constituency change is the principle that the weight of representation should follow the weight of population but the opposite has been done in this case.  Why?  The commission must have had other reasons.  Was the position of the Ceann Comhairle taken into account?  Was there an informal conversation in which it was said that if Kerry was made a one-county five-seater it would effectively be a four-seat constituency, because the Ceann Comhairle would be elected automatically?  If that was a consideration, where in the Consti<Col N="908"/>tution or the terms of reference of the commission is it stated that the position of the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s automatic re-election is to be taken into account?</P>
        <P>When the three ladies and one gentleman of the commission decided this, they were quite aware of the political consequences, as anyone would be.  Limerick loses a seat and anyone looking at the statistics over the years would assume that the seat being lost when Limerick City went from five seats to four had to be an Opposition seat.  One does not need to be a genius with numbers or to be of a speculative disposition.  Many would assume it had to be a Fine Gael seat but, even if one was to take a wider interpretation, it has to be an Opposition seat.  In Kerry, the seat being saved as the county retains its six seats has to be a Government seat, and probably a Fianna F&aacute;il seat.</P>
        <P>Not only did the commission fly in the face of the evidence of the population statistics that it produced itself, its members did so knowing there were foreseeable political consequences which would favour the Government.  That is not fair play.  I would accept this report, as I have all the revisions which have marginally affected my constituency.  I would argue that this is the way the system works and we have all decided it is the fairest way to do it.  It would be biased if it came from a Minister but with a commission it would all be fair and above board.  However, I cannot see how a commission which examined its own statistics could recommend the county in the weaker position keeping its six seats while the county in the stronger position was deprived of a seat.  Given the fact that the commission has not sought to justify or explain the decision in any way, we must draw our own conclusions.  In future, I would like the commission to provided an explanation of its decision.</P>
        <P>I will move on to discuss the part of the Limerick constituency which is in County Clare.  When one crosses the Corbally bridge one comes to housing estates such as Shannon Banks and Westbury, which are part of Limerick City but administratively are in County Clare and run by Clare County Council.  Villages from Parteen to Ardnacrusha, where the Shannon power scheme is located &mdash; many Members not familiar with other landmarks in Limerick will be aware of it &mdash; will become part of the constituency of Limerick city.  Those living in the suburban estates are essentially Limerick city people.  The people living further out in the villages of Parteen and Ardnacrusha are Clare people.  This brings with it all the tensions experienced in any border area.  These people are in a peculiar situation which it is hoped a future commission will examine.</P>
        <P>In general elections those people voted for candidates from Limerick East and in future they will be in the constituency of Limerick city.  For the purpose of local elections they are included in the Killaloe electoral district of Clare and vote for Clare councillors who take up office in Ennis with Clare County Council.  For the purpose of the European elections these people are included in the County Clare district.  The euro constituencies are made up not of D&aacute;il constituencies but of counties.  While these people reside in County Clare the MEPs for whom they can vote may represent areas as far away as Donegal.  That is the extremely anomalous position in which these 3,500 people will find themselves.</P>
        <P>I hope that the Minister of State, when replying, will provide us with more detail of future arrangements for commissions.  I understand that Mr. Frank Clarke&rsquo;s judgment provides that a future commission may work on the provisional figures of the next census rather than the final figures.  I understand from the Minister&rsquo;s preliminary remarks on Second Stage that the commission&rsquo;s report may be finalised only when the full figures are released.  There will be some time gained but not much.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to match this to the electoral cycle.  Perhaps he will also answer the following question: will there be time before the next election, provided the D&aacute;il runs its full <Col N="909"/>term, to have another revision of the constituencies?  Is it the case, as many of us believe, that because a report on provisional figures cannot be finalised, the date for the report of the commission, three months after final figures are available, will be after the last possible date of the next general election?  There is an expectation that this is a temporary arrangement and that the position will be changed again, but I do not believe that.  I would like the Minister to let us know in exact terms the timeframe and how it matches with his plans.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am aware that the inclination is for everybody to speak about their own constituency, as Deputy Noonan did so eloquently.  Clearly there is cause for debate in regard to what he said.  However, I bring the attention of the House to what occasioned the setting up of an independent boundaries commission.  I was not elected to this House until 1982.  However, I recall reading, when I was a member of a county council and local authority, about the famous &ldquo;Tullymander&rdquo; when the then Minister of the relevant Department decided he would become the god of the constituencies and that he alone would decide how each constituency was to be configured, thereby returning his colleagues and their parties to Government.  We all know this action backfired in the face of the &ldquo;Tullymander&rdquo;.  One does not like to talk in such disparaging terms about a person who has passed away so I shall not dwell further on that issue.</P>
        <P>The late Jack Lynch, the man who became Taoiseach following the election at that time, committed Fianna F&aacute;il on taking up office to establish an independent boundaries commission and so it happened.  We have stook with it ever since.  I followed the debate in my office and noted Deputies&rsquo; distinct inclination to speak about how they will be affected by the new constituency boundaries, the loss to them of valuable parts of their constituencies and how unfair all of this is.</P>
        <P>I must say, despite some rocky ups and downs in various constituencies, I prefer to stick with the independent method of deciding constituencies rather than entrust such decisions to a Labour member, as happened in the Government of 1973-77.  I find it amazing that nobody else has mentioned this during the debate.  We are led to believe that the Labour Party is all things bright and beautiful, wonderful and good, but clearly that was not the case in that instance.  The action backfired because former Taoiseach Jack Lynch romped home, if one may dare say it, with too many seats, therein sewing the seed of future disagreements and difficulties.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report.  I recall when for constituency purposes Longford was linked with Roscommon and what a jarring note that struck.  Nobody could get their heads around it or understand what led to it.  However, it was accepted and people got on with it.  Likewise in the last round of constituency changes my constituency became the constituency of Longford-Westmeath, which had a comforting ring about it and gave me hope, which was subsequently realised.  As part of the change, the north part of Meath was moved to the constituency of Meath West which has its own gripes, about which I heard Deputy Johnny Brady speak in the House.  He was bemoaning that he cannot serve certain people.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is in the House to hear my simple solution to Deputy Brady&rsquo;s problem.  I live in the town of Athlone, a busy and bustling town which has been greatly extended to the west into the area of Monksland following the construction of an enormous number of new housing estates.  As far as I am aware, Monksland is the second largest town in Roscommon &mdash; I am sure the Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong.  It is part of the Roscommon constituency and is a mile from where I live.</P>
        <P>As one can imagine at least half of the people who attend my constituency clinic are from other constituencies.  I do not moan about this but explain the situation to them and deal with their queries.  I do not believe I can deal only with people from County Westmeath or County Longford.  Many of these people would have lived in Athlone and later moved a mile or two <Col N="910"/>to <i>rus in urbe</i> because they believed they would have a better life there, and good luck to them.  They come to me because I dealt with them previously under a different constituency arrangement.  I deal with their queries, and why not?  We are all elected by the people.  On a more practical level, many of them have mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers living in the town of Athlone, which has its own wash-back.</P>
        <P>I was amazed to hear several Deputies say they could not deal with people who came to them from another constituency.  I found that odd and alarming.  I deal with people on a national level and, be that as it may, I merely wished to raise that point.</P>
        <P>The Bill is tidying up legislation and it is rather good.  The daft arrangement whereby those seeking election as Independent candidates, who were called assenters, be it to a town council, county council, the D&aacute;il or Europe, had to be assembled in a vast concourse and they had to raise their hands and say who they were representing.  That was a very cumbersome, clumsy and silly system that was introduced, I think, in 1992 and was subsequently changed.  Now, candidates need only sign a form and the requirements vary according to the electoral mandate one seeks to fill.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Central Statistics Office will review population divisions.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
        <P>I note with interest, but of course we knew it before now, that those in Longford and Westmeath are to be Connacht people.  We are being put into the European North-West constituency.  I smile when I hear about Munster refusing to accept Galway into the province for the hurling championship.  They should set up a commission.</P>

	<P>I am sorry for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
        <P>If we are to be lumped into another constituency, that is fair enough.  We will go where we are sent.  If we are part of the North-West constituency we will be glad to participate as that constituency in the forthcoming European election.  All of these changes are useful tidying-up procedures which have to be carried out, and fair dues to the Minister for getting at the things that have to be done.  Before now, all assenters had to come together at one time in one room if they supported an independent candidate, but not any more.  There are measures here to deal with this.</P>
        <P>There is a point I would like to bring up which is not in the Bill.  I should not have signalled it was not in the Bill, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will want to strike me down, but I hope he will not.  There is a huge hole in the midst of the election process, namely the electoral register.  Every attempt made to compile an electoral register or bring about a new dawn in the compilation of electoral registers does not succeed.  We are told it is up to the would-be voter to place him or herself on the register.  There are advertisements and sexy jingles on the radio which tell one to go to the post office, the Garda or the town hall and put down one&rsquo;s name.  Essentially it is one&rsquo;s own responsibility to do so.  It is also one of the responsibilities of the local authority to compile a register.  Leading up to the 2007 general election, the county councils belatedly got a handle on it, and employed people for this task.  There was a very good young woman in Westmeath County Council, but she had a whole county in front of her, involving big towns, big movements of people in and out of areas and huge numbers of houses.  Yet it was the people who went around canvassing, who would ask whether Tom was on the register because he was 19 since last March &mdash; or 25 since last March &mdash; who would find that Tom had never been registered.  If one tells the person it is his or her own job to register, that does not cut the mustard.  People want to know why they are not on this mysterious register even though they have been living in the same place for the last 25 years.</P><Col N="911"/>
        <P>As elected Deputies who got here by hook or by crook, by hard work or in any other way &mdash; and very honoured I am to be here, and I thank the voters of Longford-Westmeath who sent me &mdash; we have to get a grip on the electoral registers.  We are facing local and European elections next June, and it is now almost October.  There has been a desultory effort by some local officials to get people out and about, but it has been sporadic and haphazard.  It almost amounts to a scandal that we cannot have some system for compiling the electoral register.  Surely in our time of technological revolution we should be able to achieve this.  We all have our BlackBerrys and our e-mail accounts.  We can speak to our first cousin in Australia at the drop of the hat, and he can see that we have moved the couch in the living room because he is looking in.  It is amazing.  Yet we have not yet devised a method to streamline the electoral register.  The Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been considering the system in Northern Ireland, which has registration offices in the major towns.  This seems to put a shape on the collection and compilation of the data and its insertion into the electoral register.</P>
        <P>If a person is found voting twice he or she is subject to huge penalties.  There are major court cases, and rightly so.  As Deputies know, a person can be on as many registers as he or she likes but can only vote once.  Yet we seem to regard the gaps in our electoral register quite blithely.  I do not think this is good enough.  We are all citizens of the land and we are all entitled to vote.  Despite the fact that it is the responsibility of the individual citizen to put his or her name down, that is never thought of until quite late in the process, and then there is a run to the Garda station to have one&rsquo;s name verified and entered on the register.  By that point the process is quite burdensome, and it is difficult to sort out the information and ensure that it gets in.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is failing in his duty.  He should consider giving the duty of overseeing the correct compilation of electoral registers to one of his Ministers of State.</P>
        <P>I am aware the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has given me leeway on this issue, but it is in connection with the Bill as it is to do with voting.  It is about getting people on district councils, town councils and county councils to deal with the matter before the upcoming European elections.  If you are not in you cannot win, and if one is not in the register one cannot vote.  Surely it is not beyond the wit of man or woman to introduce a system for compiling the electoral register.  I hope the estimable civil servants who are here with the Minister will take some heed of me.  As we practitioners know, there is nothing to beat being in the field.  I knock on a door thinking a house will be favourable to me, and then I find three members of the family cannot vote because they are not on the register.  I go off dashed, and they go off thinking I have somehow deprived them of their votes.  In this way the story goes on and on.  We are all aware that on the day of voting one gets frantic telephone calls from people who say they were on the register for the last 95 occasions &mdash; or certainly 20 occasions &mdash; and suddenly some gremlin has removed them.  This is the unkindest cut of all.  One tells them it is the fault of the computer system and they were removed accidentally, but they think there is a dark plot to remove them from the register.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome the Bill and the tidying-up changes facilitated by it.  My firm belief is that the current system is far better than Tullymandering or whatever we used to have.  Whatever the inequities shown up by bruised Members talking about how the changes will be detrimental to their constituencies, the fact remains that this is a far better way to do it than on the whim of one person who wants to decide what is best for everyone in the country.  I welcome the independence of the commission, the commitment of the people on it, and its results, despite the effect they may have on particular constituencies.  One cannot cherry-pick the results and say one does not want the changes implemented in Limerick, Longford-Westmeath or Dublin North.  It does not work like that.  It is a jigsaw and all the <Col N="912"/>pieces must fit together, thereby presenting, I hope, a coherent whole in the set of electoral standards.</P>
        <P>However, coupled with my approval of the Bill and my comments in favour of it, I condemn the state of the electoral register and the inactivity of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in dealing with the problem, apart from saying, in a lofty manner, that it is a job for the county councils.  Lofty manners do not put names on electoral registers, which takes hard graft, hard work and application to the job in hand.  While it is not possible to have a foolproof electoral register I urge a very detailed assessment of how an up-to-date voting register can be put in place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Further to the point the previous speaker was making on the electoral register, in the Dublin city and county area it is possible to have two local authorities in the one constituency.  Which local authority has responsibility for that whole constituency?  The D&uacute;n Laoghaire constituency has lost a seat and Dublin South has retained its five seats.  However, Dublin South stretches from the edge of Firhouse right down to Loughlinstown hospital.  The northern end of Dublin South is in the South Dublin County Council area.  Part of that constituency is in one local authority area and the other part is in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area.  I agree some agency, possibly the Department, should be responsible for ensuring the maintenance of a proper register to allow people to exercise their franchise whenever an election might be called.</P>
        <P>I share Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s concern.  There is nothing worse than people arriving at a polling booth and finding that their names are not on the register.  This can happen despite the fact that people might have lived in the same house for years.  In a modern democracy with all the technology available surely it is not beyond the wit of man to find some system.  I do not profess to be sufficiently qualified to offer a solution.  However, there are plenty of people around and if we ask them for their advice I am sure they would be only too willing to give it to us.</P>
        <P>It has been proven that Irish people have a particular interest in elections.  In between elections people give out about politicians, day in and day out.  When it comes to the contest they are tuned into their televisions and radios to hear the results and it is part and parcel of the whole thing.  The ratings go way up on the night of a general election count.  Although people are really interested, we have done everything in our power to destroy their interest.  I will give a small example.  We introduced voting machines.  Who ever asked for them?  I never knocked on a door where somebody said to me: &ldquo;Listen, Deputy Barrett, could you do something about getting rid of this pencil and paper?  Is there not a machine we could use?&rdquo;  In the 34 years since I was first elected to public life I never heard one person complain about getting a pencil to put &ldquo;1, 2, 3&rdquo; on a piece of paper.  Yet we decided that because another country did it, we too should have voting machines.</P>
        <P>I often think of poor former Deputy Nora Owen, who was a great colleague here.  The manner in which that woman was treated on the night of that famous announcement was disgraceful.  Given that weaknesses were discovered in the electronic voting system, to this day I am sure she often wonders whether she was cheated out of her seat.  That should never be the case.  I do not see anything wrong if it takes 24 hours to physically count the votes.  We can all go in along with our tellers and all the rest of it and see the pieces of paper being opened in front of us.  If there is a recount and it takes another day, so what?  Let us get rid of this notion.</P><Col N="913"/>
        <P>While I know it is not directly the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, he is a man of great influence in the Department.  Would somebody please get rid of these machines for once and for all?  It is costing the taxpayer between &euro;1 million and &euro;2 million each year to store machines that only have a lifespan of 20 years.  They were bought approximately seven or eight years ago.  We should put up our hands and say that it was a bad idea and, even though it has cost the taxpayer &euro;52 million, get rid of them.  We could give them to somebody else if they want to play around with them and see if there is anything they can do with them &mdash; perhaps turn them into gaming machines or something.  They will not be used as voting machines.  Let us be honest about it and not add on another &euro;1 million a year or whatever it costs to store them.</P>
        <P>At this stage I am all in favour of recognising that the Irish people are quite happy with their pinn luaidhe agus p&iacute;osa&iacute; p&aacute;ip&eacute;ir as the former Taoiseach said.  They like marking &ldquo;1, 2, and 3&rdquo; and have never complained about it.  As former Deputy John Kelly, God rest him, who was famous in this place for making common sense speeches, said &ldquo;if it is not broke don&rsquo;t fix it&rdquo;.  The system should be left alone.  It is part and parcel of Irish life.  Although they have pressed buttons in the United States that did not turn out to be very successful as far as Al Gore was concerned.  Let them continue to do it over there.  We like what we are doing here and people are not complaining about it.</P>
        <P>I want to make a general point about reducing the D&uacute;n Laoghaire constituency by one seat.  I realise that a commission given the job of reviewing boundaries will need to take difficult decisions.  I am not qualified to talk about rural areas.  There are plenty of other Members who are qualified to talk about rural areas and the effects of taking bits of counties and putting them in with other counties.  I can understand the difficulties that causes for many people because people are loyal to their counties and like to be represented by their Offaly Deputy, Meath Deputy or whatever it may be.  The commission has fiddled around with the boundaries in Dublin many times.  Deputy Gregory must be the greatest survivor as an Independent Deputy.  As long as I have been in this House, every time there was a constituency boundary revision, Dublin Central was the first to get the hammer.  It has been moved all over the place.  Deputy Gregory has managed to survive which says much for his work.</P>
        <P>The part of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire constituency to be moved into Dublin South is the part that will be developed in the future.  I recently read a D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council report which anticipates a population in Cherrywood of 32,000, with 18,000 jobs planned.  That is the target for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  That part of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire constituency is the very part the commission has been taken out and put into Dublin South.  If it were necessary to redraw the boundaries and the D&uacute;n Laoghaire constituency were to lose a seat, it would have been far better to take an established part of the constituency at the other end to join in.  It is inevitable that in a subsequent revision those boundaries will need to change it again.</P>
        <P>Like previous speakers, I believe there should be a fixed term so that people are guaranteed this will not be changed every five years or whatever.  Provisions in the Bill will permit the commission to review boundaries after the initial census figures are published.  People like to have certainty.  The part that has gone from my constituency, which has been with me for the 30 odd years I have been a councillor and Deputy, is very much part of D&uacute;n Laoghaire &mdash; it is not just the votes.  It is totally foreign to what is in Dublin South.  There is no connection between Firhouse in the South Dublin County Council area and the southern part of the existing D&uacute;n Laoghaire constituency.  There is not even a bus service &mdash; they do not connect with each other.</P>
        <P>We have to be careful about who sits on these commissions.  I do not wish to criticise the integrity of those who served in the past but there is a need for people who know and under<Col N="914"/>stand the areas involved.  One likes to think they walked the territory.  I do not think the same commission should deal with urban and rural areas.  The maximum number of seats is 166.  One has to look at both rural and urban areas and arrive at a solution on the 166 seats.  The hiving off of some part of an urban area to make up the numbers upsets people as they do not have the connection and it is not good for representation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Barrett for sharing time.  I agree with much of what he and previous speakers have said that there should only be one change made to the boundaries every five or ten years.  We have to look at how we conduct our business.  We cannot have a situation where during the lifetime of a D&aacute;il there may be two revisions of boundaries.  It is unfair to the public and to the elected representatives.  </P>
        <P>I believe we need to go further.  The electoral commission and the legislation is constrained under the terms of the Constitution and the ratio of Deputies per head of population, that is, not fewer than 20,000 and not more than 30,000.  If the population continues to increase, within a few years it may be necessary to increase the number of Deputies, for which I do not think there is public support, or change the Constitution.  This is the time to set up an internal group &mdash; not engage consultants &mdash; which has the expertise to examine the impasse coming down the tracks.  Let us anticipate it and put forward proposals on how we may move forward.</P>
        <P>There is a weighted balance heading in the direction of the east coast.  I am based on the east coast, as are my two colleagues, Deputy Fleming and the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, on the far side and the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Deputy Howlin.  There is a bias towards the east coast.  In time the western seaboard and the midlands, relatively speaking, will be denuded of representation at Oireachtas level.  That is an issue we must address to make up for that counterbalance.  I recall running a proposal on it a year or two ago and I was accused of looking for two rural Deputies for every urban Deputy.  That is not the concept but it is much easier to operate a constituency, be it in Kildare or Castleknock, than in Mayo or Kerry.  The amount of travel a politician in Mayo has to endure to get around the constituency is phenomenal relative to Kildare, Meath and parts of Wicklow.  It is important that we look at those issues.</P>
        <P>When he was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, mooted the idea of single seat constituencies and was shot out of the water straight away.  We have to go back and examine that issue.  We talk about public sector reform &mdash; we must look at reform in our own electoral system.  How can we justify Deputy Barrett writing to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council about a housing issue and the housing staff having to send out 20 letters to councillors and Deputies?  That is a crazy workload to impose on the staff and it leads to inefficiency.</P>
        <P>The dual mandate was abolished to try to reform the electoral system.  I do not know how beneficial it has been.  Certainly the work has not changed.  One does not have a greater amount of time for dealing with legislation and other such matters.  If anything, work has become more difficult because one still has to access all the services as in the past, except that one does not have the personal relationships one had in the past to do so.</P>
        <P>As far as it is possible, I would like county boundaries maintained.  However, I am the beneficiary of a small part of Carlow which has been very kind to me.  On Committee Stage, if I can get agreement, I hope to table an amendment to rename the constituency Wicklow-Carlow as opposed to Wicklow because it is important to recognise the contribution the people of Carlow make in that constituency.  Despite submissions made by some public representatives in County Carlow about the population being disenfranchised, the vote turnout increased in that part of the constituency.  I will allow people to draw their own conclusions.</P><Col N="915"/>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the conduct of elections, reference has been made to the electoral register.  One electoral register system will not work.  There is a need to have several systems in place at the one time.  Under the current system of knocking on doors and putting in slips of paper, if the document is not returned the person is struck off the register.  During the Lisbon treaty referendum a lady came into my office crying.  She had voted in 13 general elections, three by-elections, eight local elections, six European elections and a number of presidential elections, but had been struck off the register.  No matter what system is in place we will run into difficulty.  I cannot recall the reason but some years ago in my constituency there was an appeal mechanism in place for one of the referenda.  There should be an appeal mechanism in place on the day in the event of a difficulty.  If somebody arrives at a polling booth, he or she can approach the polling clerk and telephone the county registrar, his or her representative or somebody in the local authority and make his or her case.  It is soul destroying not to be able to vote on an issue.  One can see the impact it has on people and it is not difficult to deal with the issue there and then.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the conduct of elections, many people believe that politicians know how they vote, due to the fact that we check the tallies and how many people voted from a particular street.  The clear message has got to go out that we do not know how each individual votes.  Many people can be intimidated on the basis that they feel the politicians know how they vote.  It is important to realise that the only way one can be sure that somebody does not vote for one is if one gets no vote in the box.  There is no other way.  That message should go out loud and clear.</P>
        <P>Aligned to that are the improvements made in recent years in regard to pressurising people at the entrance to polling stations.  No agent should be allowed within the vicinity of a polling station.  Once the election is called, people should go to the polling station and cast their vote.  There should be nobody there checking off the register.  Perhaps we are unique in my constituency, but anything I see is purely to intimidate or influence the voter&rsquo;s right at the polling booth.  We need to provide in future legislation that just as posters are not allowed within 100 m of a polling station, an agent or someone else who can influence a candidate should not be allowed within 100 m of a polling station.</P>
        <P>On the issue of posters, I am a strong advocate of, and I expect to see legislation from the Green Minister in this regard, confining the erection of posters during election campaigns to certain designated areas in the constituency.  For example, in Wexford, there might be some posters on the N11 as one approaches Gorey, some outside Wexford and Enniscorthy.</P>

	<P>Wexford is more important than Gorey.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>There is the danger that this could give a certain advantage to the incumbents as opposed to the individual who is starting off.  Serious consideration will have to be given to designating areas for posters because they destroy the countryside, are an unnecessary expense and are a massive headache for the public and the politicians taking part.  There is a need to designate areas in constituencies where posters can be erected.</P>
        <P>There is much emphasis on election spend once elections have been called.  I have to be honest and say that the system has been circumvented by many politicians and political parties.  We need a transparent system with regard to election spend and how fundraising is carried out.  I am a strong advocate of limiting the election spend between elections.  There are some people out there who spend an inordinate amount of money between elections, trying to soften up the electorate.  It is unfair that votes can actually be bought.  Perhaps the spend should be limited to a couple of grand every 12 months on a politician promoting himself or herself, as <Col N="916"/>distinct from giving out information to the public.  We have to look at curtailing the buying off of community groups with sponsorship and so on.</P>
        <P>The final issue relates to the last referendum and the McKenna judgment.  The Government must examine that judgment, not in the context of Lisbon but in the calm light of day, because it is undemocratic; it is outrageous.  I tried to get on local radio during the Lisbon treaty campaign but failed.  Who decides what is 50% of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side?  How is that determined?  The Lisbon treaty referendum result was determined on the basis of the access to finance that people had.  That is not a democratic system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  By and large it deals with new D&aacute;il constituency boundaries.  I have several observations to make with regard to the commission itself in terms of how it went about its work and the outcome.  There are some geographical areas I wish to highlight and I will deal with some of the points raised in the debate concerning the conduct of elections and various related matters.</P>
        <P>First, there must be general acceptance that we must have an independent commission.  If this work were left to politicians, inevitably the Minister and the Government of the day would have the major say in what was to happen.  In any case, the public would not tolerate this and we would diminish ourselves if we tried to influence the independence of the commission.</P>
        <P>I presume the commission set about its work in an objective manner.  We must, however, examine its membership.  I mean no disrespect to any member of the commission, to its make-up or to the commitment of the membership to do their work in a fair and impartial manner.  However, they represent what I would consider a very small group, internal to the operations of the franchise section of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the operations of the Oireachtas building itself.  I believe a commission would benefit from having a broader membership.  I do not refer to party representatives but a broader based membership would benefit the commission rather than the small select group involved.</P>
        <P>It is also important to acknowledge that the commission does not have a free hand but must work within the Constitution, legislation and its own terms of reference.  In general, these refer to the size of constituencies, whether three, four or five-seaters.  No six or sever-seaters are permitted.  They must respect as far as possible the county boundaries and also, where possible and practicable, existing constituency boundaries without making wholescale unnecessary changes.</P>
        <P>The reference to provincial boundaries may not have been included in the last terms of reference.  In hindsight, that was a mistake but one would have assumed that it was not necessary to spell out to an intelligent commission that breaking provincial boundaries should have been avoided.  A justification of a sort for doing so was produced and was, at best, half-hearted.</P>
        <P>Regarding the process of the commission&rsquo;s work, public submissions were invited and a large number was received.  My family and I put together a submission because we gave due consideration to the matter.  A number of hours went into that submission.  In fairness, I must ask what the point is in having a process for making public submissions if those who do not bother to make one complain when they see the work submitted by others.  It is like everything we do in public life.  This House set up a process and we should respect it.  When there is a county development plan at home, those who make no submissions will still complain and say they do not agree with something in the plan even though they do not bother to involve themselves.</P><Col N="917"/>
        <P>I know a large number of submissions were photostatted copies of work done by people in Leitrim which were on the website for anyone to see.  The county of Leitrim has definitely been badly served not merely by this commission, but also by the previous one.  However, I would like a greater engagement in the submission process by the public and by people with an interest in these issues.  If the energy that has gone into debating the outcome of the report had gone into making submissions in the first place, perhaps we might have had a different report.  However, people are entitled to comment on the outcome.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested that in the future the commission might be asked to produce only a draft report for consideration by the Oireachtas.  That is a possibility, but the work of the commission is undermined if it can be easily dissected here on the floor of the House.  This is a valid point of view but the outcome might be fraught with danger and careful consideration would have to be given if this were to happen.</P>
        <P>The report was produced, the debate has been had and we are now commencing the legislation.  It is up to the Oireachtas to take action.  Ultimately, it can decide to change the report.  It is a democracy and this is only a commission&rsquo;s report, not the Bible.  There is a general acceptance not to tinker with the edges of the report.  Once the cherry-picking of pieces is begun, there will be a piece somebody does not like and then another somebody else does not care for.  It is important to keep the integrity of the report.</P>
        <P>My biggest problem is with the actual work of the commission.  Perhaps when the debate is concluded the Minister can spell out the details.  I would like to know what they are.  Perhaps I should know the following but I do not.  Are all the working papers of the commission available under the Freedom of Information Act?  Are they available in the first place, without the requirement to use the Act?</P>
        <P>It was a public process.  The submissions were on the website and I believe the work of the commission should also be there, not merely the final report.  I would like to see that available for those who want to scrutinise the work and see how the commission went about it.  I believe it held six meetings.  I would like to see the minutes and the discussion that took place at each of those meetings.  I know there were support staff who probably came from the franchise section of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>In the inevitable way these things occur, the commission would have had a meeting to consider the submissions and a general discussion, followed by someone going away to produce a first draft of the report.  That would have come back, been looked at and then there might have been a second or a third draft.  It would help the understanding of the process by the Oireachtas and by the public if we could see all this material, after the fact.  This is not an attempt to interfere with an ongoing process but rather, when the work is completed, to be in a position to see how the commission went about it and the different elements of consideration that went into various aspects.</P>
        <P>I will refer to one direct statement in the commission&rsquo;s report which I find completely unsatisfactory.  There are 166 Deputies at present and the figure can range from 164 to 168.  I believe there was a proper way to have gone about this aspect of the work and perhaps the members did so, but I do not know what way they approached it because I have not seen the information.  That is why I would like to see their work.</P>
        <P>The members should have looked at the population changes on the basis of how a constituency boundary would work if there were 164 Deputies.  Another schedule might have posed the question of how it would work with 165, 166, 167 or 168 Deputies.  There should have been a range of possibilities to examine.  I am genuinely concerned.  I would like if my concern could be dispelled but I suspect that a unilateral decision was made at the beginning to stick with <Col N="918"/>166 Deputies in the belief that the public would not accept any more.  I do not believe that is the case.  There might be a hullabaloo in the papers for two days and then life would move on.</P>
        <P>There has been a 25% increase in the population since 1980 and a corresponding great increase in the numbers of people in each constituency.  The figure has gone from 20,000 per Deputy to 25,000.  I maintain that rigid adherence to a total of 166 Deputies, as laid out by the commission on several occasions, is adding to the democratic deficit in this country.  The population is increasing and the numbers of elected representatives is held at a pre-existing level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to know how the members arrived at this decision.  If they were able to show me that they had looked at how the situation might work with 167 or 168 Deputies, that such an outcome would lead to mass changes and that, therefore, having 166 Deputies was the neatest solution, that would be well and good.  However, I do not believe this is the case and I genuinely do not believe they consider it so either.  In its report the commission points out that there are arguments for and against changing the total number of seats but that, after detailed consideration, it was   decided not to recommend any change because &ldquo;it was satisfied that the present level of membership allowed for a reasonable arrangement of constituencies in accordance with the relevant constitutional provisions in its terms of reference&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>If I were a commission member given a job to do by the Oireachtas and were to report back at the finish that I did a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; job, I would not consider that to be a good job, a fairly good job or an excellent job.  By their own admission the commissioners are saying, at best, that they did a reasonable job.  I consider that to be very weak.  Was it a good job, a fairly poor job, a fair job, a reasonable job or a very good job?  They have pitched their assessment of the report at the lower level of competence.  They could not say that they had compiled a good report.  To say it was reasonable is a weak assessment of the situation and they know it.  Unnecessary changes were made and had they changed to a system of 167 or 168 Deputies we might have seen fewer constituency changes and more continuity.</P>
        <P>Continuity in constituencies helps in the representation of constituents.  Constant changes to constituencies contribute to the democratic deficit because people are familiar with public representatives in their area.  No account was taken of increases in population and I hope the next commission is instructed, in its terms of reference, to take cognisance of the population with regard to the number of Deputies.  If the population decreases some day and the number of Deputies must fall, then that is fine, but rigidly adhering to a limit of 166 Deputies without examining how the figure is reached is not a good approach.  Perhaps light can be cast on this aspect.</P>
        <P>I hope that before there is a new commission an Oireachtas committee can examine this matter.  I am Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Local Government and I am not looking for another job, but I feel there should be an all-party approach to this to see how a commission goes about its work.  It seems to be something of a black box and the process could have been helped by oral submissions.  If one can make an oral submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on a planning matter, there should be an opportunity for citizens to do so in this regard.  This applies particularly to the people of Leitrim, who would have appreciated the opportunity to make an oral submission to the commission.  There was no provision for this and it marks another democratic deficit in the process.  The commission went about its work behind closed doors, without public information on how decisions were reached.</P>
        <P>An Opposition Deputy said he was upset at changes in his constituency, which he believes may have been almost political in nature.  I can understand that a commission would be afraid of such accusations and I think the report of every recent commission has tried to ensure that they could not be accused of political favouritism towards the Government.  The commissions <Col N="919"/>over compensated on every recent occasion and set out to change the constituency of the Taoiseach of the day.  Dublin Central was mentioned and one wonders how Deputy Tony Gregory survives as an Independent Deputy.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was in that constituency and it was changed on every occasion.</P>
        <P>My constituency, Laois-Offaly, is the home of the current Taoiseach and is a five-seater in the midlands.  It is close enough to Dublin and the east coast to see an increase in population in line with the national increase in population, but the western half of the constituency has seen a decrease in population, like the western seaboard.  Laois-Offaly has always grown in population in line with the national increase in population and, for this reason, it is the only constituency to go untouched by a boundary commission since the foundation of the State.  However, because it is now the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency I think a decision was made to make changes to it, lest the commission be accused of supporting the Government.  The commission can then always say &ldquo;we made changes to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency&rdquo;.  There is a pattern of commissions doing this and it is an objective fact that every commission does so.  I feel this is done to demonstrate that the commission is not influenced by the Taoiseach.  The facts bear this out, though some might not like to hear it.</P>

	<P>I do not know about that.</P>
        <P>The major question is whether the next general election will be fought on these new boundaries.  We do not know the answer, partly because we do not know the population changes that may occur.  Also, we do not have fixed term elections in Ireland.  If we had elections regularly, every four or five years, as is the case in many other countries, people could plan accordingly.  There would be greater certainty and this could be a factor in making a decision.</P>
        <P>I understand the complaints people have about certain changes, particularly those affecting Limerick, Kerry, Leitrim, Meath and Louth.  I especially understand the problems in Dublin.  A cohesive town in north Dublin, possibly Swords, has been divided down the main street.  Why dissect a cohesive urban area?  This probably happened because of the commission&rsquo;s determination to keep the number of Deputies in the D&aacute;il at 166.  There is an increasing population in that part of the country &mdash; north Dublin, west Dublin and Louth &mdash; and it should have gained extra seats.  The commission felt restricted by the need to keep the number of Deputies in the D&aacute;il at 166 and this has resulted in extra changes being made.</P>
        <P>Many other issues have been mentioned during this debate.  Whether or not it is due to foresight, the figures of 20,000 and 30,000 set out in the Constitution are based on population, not voters or citizens.  It is somewhat ironic that the courts upheld the decision to proceed with the preparation of a draft, as early as possible, based on the draft census and population.  We all know people can move around and if one were to conduct a census today one might see a smaller population in some areas, though the number of Irish citizens and Irish-born people may not have changed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is up to the Oireachtas to decide the course to take on this but I expect the Bill will pass without undue difficulties in the House.  That is how it should be but we should seek greater transparency in future commission reports &mdash; there should be scope for public submissions.  The democratic deficit should be eliminated by investigating the fact the population per Deputy is 25,000, compared to 20,000 a few years ago.</P>
        <P>It was suggested in the House that single-seat constituencies could be a help but I oppose this.  It might suit politicians to be elected and have no challenger but that is why I oppose such a system &mdash; it is bad for the public.  In England, Labour Party voters in a constituency represented by a Conservative will feel disenfranchised and will not be inclined to approach him <Col N="920"/>or her.  In Ireland it would be wrong to start dividing four-seaters into four single-seat constituencies because people of another allegiance would feel they did not have a representative in the national Parliament.  This system would be convenient for Deputies but would be bad generally.  We always talk about competition in the marketplace and the little bit of competition we must endure in three, four and five seat constituencies keeps us on our toes, whether we like it or not.  We might complain about residents&rsquo; groups writing to each TD in a constituency but it keeps us busy and serves the electorate.  People have said a complaint in an area leads to a great deal of correspondence for local authorities and State bodies but there would not be so many letters if the local authorities and State bodies operated more efficiently in the first place.  It is not the fault of the public if people must go to their elected representatives to get action from a Government body in the area.  Besides, a change to single-seat constituencies would require a constitutional referendum.</P>
        <P>Also with regard to single-seat constituencies, it is important that the public not only has a choice on polling day but has a choice every day between general elections, thanks to having a choice of representatives in Parliament.  Choice in a democracy means more than having a choice one day every five years.</P>
        <P>Electronic voting was also mentioned in the House and it was suggested that the people of Ireland love using a pencil to vote.  This is not the case &mdash; the last general election saw 25,000 spoiled votes by people using a peann luaidhe.  They marked X twice or three times or marked two ones or two twos and so on.  In many constituencies the number of spoiled votes exceeded the difference between the last candidate elected and the next candidate in line.  Awful mistakes occur in votes cast using a peann luaidhe.  Some 500 or 600 people in each constituency, over 20,000 nationwide, went home from the polling station thinking they had voted for their candidate of choice.  Those votes, effectively, went into the bin because of the peann luaidhe.  One of the advantages of electronic voting is it would not allow this to happen.  Most of us know a person who might wish to vote for three candidates in an election and so placed an X next to each of their names.  This achieves nothing.</P>
        <P>In the interests of allowing the people to cast their votes correctly, we must move away from the existing system that leads to many spoiled votes and people&rsquo;s disenfranchisement.</P>
        <P>A number of other issues were mentioned in the course of this campaign in terms of the conduct of elections and the voters&rsquo; register.  While one could talk forever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>That sounds daunting.  I will begin my observations by referring to a paragraph in the first chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, which was published recently and is highly pertinent to both today&rsquo;s topic and the economy.  The Comptroller and Auditor General disclosed that during the D&aacute;il and Seanad elections of 2007, An Post delivered almost 26 million items of mail to voters in both elections.  The chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report details how, because of the manner in which the legislation from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is framed, it is impossible for the D&aacute;il and Seanad to secure a deal on bulk volume postage, as would be the case with any commercial operation.  Consequently, An Post maintains, probably <Col N="921"/>correctly, that it is legally bound to charge the full whack for the 25 million items of mail.  One should bear in mind that the mail for Seanad elections normally is delivered by registered post, which is more expensive.  Last year, the State paid An Post nearly &euro;15 million in postage for the D&aacute;il and Seanad elections.</P>
        <P>As Members are discussing ways to try to prune back unnecessary public expenditure, this area is crying out for reform and, together with many political colleagues, I have called for such reform for many years.  Not only should a bulk discount be obtained for delivery of this mail, but the system must be completely reformed.  At present, those who wish to avail of the free postage available to D&aacute;il and Seanad candidates must send an addressed item to everyone on the electoral register.  In the not unusual case of a five-seater constituency in which ten candidates are standing, a not unusual household with two adults and three young adult children, that is five voters, will receive through its door 50 items of election material.  Such material will have been posted to the electors in the house as free post at full postage stamp cost.</P>
        <P>This has been the cause of an enormous amount of scandal to voters, including during the Lisbon referendum.  Two or three items of material from political parties often arrive on the same day or all together in sequence over a single weekend.  It would be a simple matter to reform this system by doing a deal with An Post in which candidates retain the right to free postage, as it is important to be able to communicate with the electors, particularly in these days of gated communities where it can be difficult to gain access to them.  Why not simply allow a single item to be delivered to each house on behalf of each candidate?  Moreover, why must such literature be addressed?  It could be used as a circular which is delivered and dropped.  I reckon the cost and numbers of items posted could be cut by between one third and one fifth.  I am neither the first nor the only person who has called for reform.  This would save both money and many trees because political parties could reduce the number of circulars they are obliged to send to each person on the register and costs would be cut accordingly.</P>
        <P>As for the debate on constituency boundaries, the Government should indicate at the conclusion of this debate whether it considers the proposed constituency boundaries to be definitive and whether they are likely to be in force for the next election.  I note the way the economy and the Government are going.  The Progressive Democrats are now gone and the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, holds power as a kind of independent in government.  The Green Party flutters from time to time and while its Members are happy to be there, they are growing a paler shade of green as the economy worsens.  Consequently, it is highly likely the next election will be fought before another census has been taken.  All the shape throwing should be cut and the Government should indicate that these are likely to be the constituencies on which the election is to be fought.  In addition, the census has been postponed as part of previous cutbacks.  Indications already have been given that with the variety of other data that are collected, a ten year census, which now is usual in most countries, probably would be perfectly acceptable in Ireland, except that constituency revision is tied to the census data.</P>
        <P>I noted with interest that a Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher, Deputy Michael Kennedy, who was elected to represent Dublin North at the last election, was particularly concerned that Swords has been cut up like a cake.  Two thirds of the town will remain in Dublin North while one third will be transferred to the constituency I have the honour to represent, namely, Dublin West.  In a letter to constituents, Deputy Kennedy stated the boundary commission is independent, even if it has made some stupid decisions and because of the so-called independence, all previous Governments have accepted its recommendations.  He stated the only way this proposal would be defeated is if Fine Gael and Labour were to kick up a fuss and then Fianna F&aacute;il would be willing to refer the matter back to the committee for review but that were Fianna F&aacute;il do this on its own, it would be accused of gerrymandering.  Basically, this constitutes kicking the ball over to the Opposition.  While it has views on this matter, the Opposition does not <Col N="922"/>have the power to act.  An issue that clearly causes some unhappiness in Fianna F&aacute;il circles, as it probably does in both Fine Gael and Labour, suddenly is shifted to become the responsibility of the Opposition.  Deputy Kennedy also stated that when the matter came up for discussion in the D&aacute;il, he would be speaking strongly against the proposals but his voting against it would achieve nothing.</P>
        <P>He is agin it but he will not be voting agin it.  This constitutes nods and winks on a peculiarly elevated scale.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, must clearly state that the Government accepts this recommendation.  It is from an independent commission, regardless of whether one likes it.  There are flaws in the commission&rsquo;s decisions, as well as ample room to improve the way in which it works.  However, it would be almost impossible for the Government to reject the findings of an independent commission.  Moreover, if one opts for another review, who is to say that another set of people will not be made unhappy, were those who are unhappy at present to have their concerns addressed by a review? It is for the Government, particularly the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to state clearly whether it accepts the commission report and we will now sit down to work on the revision as suggested.</P>
        <P>This matter should be concluded as soon as possible as the uncertainty holds out hope for people who are concerned about their representation.  These include people in Leitrim, those in Swords who have been transferred to Dublin West, people in parts of south Offaly around Shinrone who have been transferred to Tipperary North and people in south Limerick who have been transferred to Kerry North.  There are certainly difficulties in various areas in terms of electoral representation and real challenges for politicians.</P>
        <P>We either have an independent commission and accept the recommendations, which we must, or we reform the commission process in an orderly way.  We should let people know what will happen.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has already proposed that the Constituency Commission should act similarly to similar bodies in other countries.  They advertise the recommendations and hold a local hearing on them so people with serious issues have a chance to put their case.  That would be the best thing to do as it would allow a degree of public engagement, both by political parties and, more importantly, individual citizens in how they felt the constituency boundaries ought to be drawn to maximise political representation.</P>
        <P>I heard Deputy Fleming say Laois-Offaly really has not changed much since the foundation of the State.  Dublin West is probably the constituency that has changed with every revision more than any other in the State because of its growth in population.  In the 1970s, when I was a student, Dublin West extended from near Sandyford through places like Newcastle and Rathcoole into what is now the west side of Dublin, including Lucan, Blanchardstown, Clonsilla etc. all the way out to Balbriggan.  That was one constituency.  Clearly, as these areas grew they were lopped off to their own constituencies.  The process has continued.</P>
        <P>In the previous boundary revision, Lucan and Palmerstown became Dublin Mid-West and Dublin West became a three-seat constituency taking in Castleknock, Clonsilla, Mulhuddart, St. Margaret&rsquo;s, Coolquay and various other areas of rural north and west County Dublin.</P>
        <P>In this revision, the boundary review commission is going further into what we traditionally call north County Dublin.  It has indicated that Dublin West should absorb approximately a third of Swords, specifically the area around River Valley and Forest Little.  That poses difficulties for Swords.  The core of the Dublin West constituency is the new town of Blanchardstown, Castleknock, Clonsilla and Mulhuddart, which had a population at the last census of 92,000.  It is more than twice the size of Waterford, bigger than Galway and pretty much the <Col N="923"/>same size as Limerick city.  Swords is the county town and has a population heading for 40,000 but it has now been split, with a third of it going to Dublin West.</P>
        <P>Understandably, many are worried that the kind of force of representation as a new town and developing area that Swords might have is being split between two constituencies.  I am very pleased to have been given the opportunity to represent Swords and I know that part of the town particularly well.  It suits me fine and I represented large areas of the old north County Dublin on the old Dublin County Council.  I have many contacts in the area.</P>
        <P>For the many thousands of people who have come to live in the new developing parts of Swords, they have barely got used to the idea of one set of public representatives before approximately 12,000 have found they must address public representatives with whom they have not been particularly familiar with up to now.  They may be lucky in one sense in that the public representatives from Dublin West are the Minister for Finance, the Fine Gael spokesperson on enterprise and myself, as we are moderately well known.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that will help assuage some of the concerns.  This is important because, as with the greater town of Blanchardstown and the developing town of Swords &mdash; the county town of Fingal &mdash; when it comes to development issues like public transport, investment in education etc., public representatives put on the jersey for Dublin West and Swords despite party differences.  They act as best they can in the collective best interests of the communities on the west and north side of Dublin.</P>
        <P>The commission&rsquo;s work there was difficult but it is now important that the Government shows certainty as to what it proposes to do.  Will it accept the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report and will it bring it into force so that the uncertainty which applies can be settled once and for all?</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the recent review  of local authority boundaries commissioned by the Minister, I am thankful that Swords retained an independent identity.  The current position with regard to local authority ward boundaries was retained.  Importantly, however, the average representation in Fingal is now 10,000 people per councillor.  This means each councillor is effectively representing, depending on the number of seats in the constituency, from one third to one fifth of a D&aacute;il constituency.  It makes extraordinarily difficult and taxing representation for the kinds of issues that councillors deal with at local level.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In speaking about new communities, politicians and particularly councillors have an important role in reaching out to people who have bought a home and come to live in an estate of 500, 1,000 or 2,500 people.  One estate in Dublin West, Tyrellstown, has been almost entirely constructed and occupied in the past six years and it currently has 2,500 occupied houses.  There is no permanent school building yet and no public transport infrastructure other than a bus route.  All those economists who fancy buses as a solution to all our public transport issues should live in Tyrellstown for a while, commute by bus and see how much they like it in comparison to metro, rail or Luas.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The failure of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address the issue of representation is one of the reasons that in very big urban areas like Fingal County Council, it is really difficult for councillors to help foster a sense of community welcome and an invitation to people to participate and work with them to the betterment and development of the community.</P>
      
        <P>It is interesting to note that in Leitrim, where people have understandably complained about not having an opportunity to elect a Deputy from the county, each local councillor represents <Col N="924"/>approximately 1,400 people.  The county&rsquo;s deficit in terms of Deputies is to some extent counter-balanced by the number of councillors it has, which makes vibrant interaction between local representatives and citizens possible.  Councillors represent relatively small communities of only 1,400 or 1,500 people, whereas their counterparts in Dublin West and Dublin North represent on average more than 10,000 people.  Deputy Fleming referred to the democratic deficit.  The discrepancy I have outlined constitutes one of the key demographic deficits which, regrettably, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has chosen not to address.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Michael Fitzpatrick.</P>
        <P>I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill.  I concur with my colleague, Deputy Burton, on many of the points she made.  I propose to discuss our good fortune in having such a process for fixing the boundaries of our electoral constituencies.  I will also raise a concern that electoral boundaries and many of the other administrative boundaries we use do not coincide.  I will then refer to under-representation of urban areas, another issue raised by Deputy Burton.  I will conclude by looking to the future.</P>
        <P>This a necessary and worthy Bill.  Proportionality is an important principle, as is the onus in the Constitution to ensure each Deputy represents between 20,000 and 30,000 people.  Fulfilling the latter requirement creates winners and losers.  For example, the reduction from five seats to four seats in my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire will make life more difficult for the five sitting Deputies but make life easier for those seeking to be elected in other constituencies.</P>

	<P>Mr. Boyd Barrett will be looking for a seat. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>However, I am sure my colleagues like a challenge and we will no doubt triumph against the numbers. </P>
        <P>It is interesting to examine the process used to effect the distribution of seats.  In fairness to those involved in the process we, in Ireland, can hold our heads high because we do not engage in gerrymandering, for which I have found no evidence in the recent past.  We need look no further than the United States to see a backward system which essentially allows those with political influence to change constituency boundaries.  While reading Barack Obama&rsquo;s autobiography, <i>The Audacity of Hope</i>, I was taken aback to learn that he drew a line on a map to decide what would be his local constituency in the state of Illinois.  This was an example of gerrymandering at its worst.  Whether it be Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts from 1810 to 1812 who drew a line on the map to facilitate his re-election or the lines still being drawn by most US politicians in state elections, we can count ourselves lucky that we do not have such political influence over constituency boundaries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned at the different boundaries we use for different functions, for example, policing, health, education, housing and local administration.  Having a plethora of different boundaries which do not necessarily coincide gives rise to confusion in the eyes of members of the public and causes problems in finding basic statistical data, such as crime rates and levels of participation in education.  In considering this legislation, I ask that we try to improve the confluence of administrative boundaries.  I accept that the Dublin Regional Authority examined this issue some time ago and some improvements have been made.  When I was a councillor in the inner city in the early 1990s my local electoral boundary strayed into three different D&aacute;il constituencies, namely, Dublin Central, Dublin South-Central and Dublin South-East.  While some improvements have been forthcoming, much more progress could be made.</P><Col N="925"/>
        <P>Electoral boundaries can be confusing.  Many believe I represent D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown rather than D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Although D&uacute;n Laoghaire is in south Dublin in the wider sense, Dublin South is in the Rathdown side of the town while south Dublin does not coincide with the Dublin South constituency but is a completely different local electoral area.  If I am somewhat confused by this, the good people of Dublin are much more confused.  The media is also frequently confused by the different electoral areas, partly as a result of the nomenclature we use.  The term &ldquo;D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown&rdquo; does not trip lightly off the tongue.  Perhaps we should consider having more effective names for constituencies in Dublin.</P>
        <P>I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Burton&rsquo;s comments on over-representation in some rural areas.  I took time to consult Google and Wikipedia before coming to the House and found that in 2006 County Leitrim had a population of 28,837 and 22 elected local authority members.  In other words, each councillor represented 1,311 people.  In the same year, the population of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown electoral area was 193,688, for which it had 27 elected members or one councillor for every 7,173 people.  Councillors in both areas received an annual payment of &euro;16,756, despite the fact that each councillor in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown represents five and a half times more people than his or her counterparts in County Leitrim.</P>
        <P>It is no coincidence that the greater Dublin area is haemorrhaging councillors as elected representatives resign from their respective councils.  I suspect this trend is connected to their workload.  I understand 16 or 17 councillors in the region resigned in recent years.  While some resignations were due to substitutions being made for councillors elected to the Oireachtas, many councillors resigned due to their workload.  It is not surprising that a councillor who represents 5.5 times as many people as his or her counterpart in County Leitrim would find the workload onerous.  I am curious to learn whether councillors have resigned from Leitrim County Council.  If so, I suspect the number who have done so is much lower than in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>It is curious that while the Constitution stipulates that D&aacute;il Deputies must represent between 20,000 and 30,000, we allow considerable more latitude in our county councils.  Another, more disturbing aspect to the level of under-representation and over-representation is the fact that councillors and their Oireachtas colleagues elect 43 of the 66 Senators to the Upper House.  I suspect that rural interests are in some cases over-represented in the House to the detriment of urban interests.  From observing debate in the Upper House, it is clear that farming interests, the need for rural roads to be upgraded, rural housing and so forth are the subject of intense debate, while issues such as metro and light rail for Dublin, the layout of apartments, noise pollution and proper planning do not receive similar attention.  In a subtle, perhaps understated way we do not get the same focus on urban issues.</P>
        <P>If anything has changed in Ireland during the past 20 years, it is that there has been a dramatic expansion of urban areas.  I would be concerned if such areas were under-represented in city and county council chambers and in the Upper House of the Oireachtas.  I plead, therefore, that we reconsider the levels of representation and ensure that urban areas receive the attention they deserve.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is bringing forward proposals regarding a directly-elected mayor for Dublin.  This will ensure a strong voice will be given to the interests of the metropolitan area.  It is crucial that cities should have a voice, regardless of whether it be in respect of matters such as waste management, water supplies, sewerage systems or urban transport.  In that context, I refer to Barcelona, under former mayor Pasqual Maragall in the 1980s and 1990s, and various cities in France and the United States.  I am sure everyone remembers two former mayors of New York, <Col N="926"/>Ed Koch and Rudolph Guiliani.  If a city has a voice, the chances are that its interests will be better represented.  Directly-elected mayors are an important component in that regard.</P>
        <P>On the wider issue of electoral reform, we intend to establish an independent electoral commission that will take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight.  Said commission will also be responsible for matters relating to electoral funding and for ensuring that there will be an independent electoral register.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Financing is crucial.  It makes a mockery of the financial process that we only take into account contributions made during electoral campaigns.  One candidate in D&uacute;n Laoghaire spent &euro;45,000 on a campaign to be elected not to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but to the county council.  This is unfair, particularly when one considers that colleagues from my party only spent in the order of &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000 on their campaigns.  We must ensure that a high level of scrutiny and adequate spending controls are put in place in respect of the Oireachtas.  There is a need to consider what is contributed and spent in the 12 months prior to general elections.  We must also examine the position in respect of spending limits.</P>
        <P>I am heartened by the introduction of the Bill, which contains many good ideas.  I look forward to more substantial work being completed in the general area of electoral reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrickFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008, which will have a real and practical effect on the political system in this country.</P>
        <P>Population figures show that there are some serious variances from the national average population per Deputy in a number of constituencies.  The Government has accepted the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s recommendations as a single package of interlinked measures that will, in accordance with constitutional imperatives and other legal requirements, bring D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies into line with prevailing population patterns.  The report that the commission returned is the best with which it could come up.  Certain Deputies, even some in my party, may not be completely satisfied with the report but they must accept that the commission was obliged to work within its statutory terms of reference.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers raised a raft of issues in respect of their constituencies.  A slight change has been recommended in respect of my constituency, Kildare North.  The population of Kildare has increased by almost 14% since 2002.  The population in the county in 2006 was equivalent to 7.3 seats.  The commission suggested, as the appropriate approach on this occasion, that there be a population transfer between the two constituencies in the county in order to address the variance in Kildare South.  In recommending the addition of one seat to Kildare North, the 2003-04 commission suggested the transfer of an area in the north west of the county to that constituency and the Oireachtas made the necessary legislative provision.</P>
        <P>The 2003-04 commission, in recommending the addition of a seat to Kildare North, also recommended transfer of an area in the north west of the county to that constituency from Kildare South and the Oireachtas legislated in respect of this.  The current commission recommends the transfer of a further electoral division in the north west, and one in the north east of Kildare South, from that constituency to Kildare North.  The total population will be is 1,314.  This will provide Kildare North with a percentage variance of plus 4.2% from the national average population per Deputy.</P>
        <P>I accept that there are Deputies who will be more severely affected by the proposed changes.  However, I genuinely urge them to support the commission&rsquo;s report.  It is very important that we maintain the long-established practice of implementing the recommendations of constitu<Col N="927"/>ency commissions in full.  To reject some of the commission&rsquo;s recommendations would be to revert to the partisan approach of the past, when constituency revisions were seen as having been framed to secure political advantage for the Government of the day.  Those days are long gone.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Clarke&rsquo;s judgment last year emphasises the urgent obligation on the Oireachtas to revise constituencies as soon as it becomes clear from a census that existing constituencies no longer have the level of proportionality that the Constitution requires.  We have all had time to review the examples of the serious disparities that occur in some constituencies and we now have the opportunity to act and deal with these.  In a judgment handed down in the O&rsquo;Donovan case, Mr. Justice Budd of the High Court stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . although a system in the main based on counties has in fact been adopted, there is nothing in the Constitution about constituencies being based on counties. The Constitution does not say that in forming the constituencies according to the required ratio, that shall be done so far as is practicable having regard to county boundaries.</P>
        <P FLI="0">When it comes to politics &mdash; as opposed to matters relating to the GAA &mdash; county boundaries are not sacrosanct.  Rather, it is those we represent who must come first when constituencies are being drawn up.  As far as possible, the proportionality of constituents per Deputy must be maintained at a level that best serves the people.  We must look beyond county loyalties and focus instead on our loyalty to best serving our constituents, regardless of the county in which they may reside.</P>
        <P>The Bill brings forward significant and worthwhile improvements to the processes followed by constituency commissions in their work, as well as putting in place measures to facilitate the holding of the upcoming European and local elections.  It is an essential item of legislation and I urge Members to support it.</P>
        <P>It is good that we are engaged in a debate on matters of this nature.  What we are doing here today is keeping the wheels of democracy in motion and ensuring that the most efficient political model possible operates in this country.  By passing the Bill we will ensure that our constituents are served to the best degree possible under our political system.  We are here to serve the people.  In a time of much cynicism regarding politics and politicians, the Bill allows us to show members of the public that we have their best interests at heart.</P>
        <P>I thank the commission for the work it has done.  I acknowledge that it had a difficult task. It is in all our interests that the Bill be passed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>As the previous speaker stated, ensuring that matters relating to constituency boundaries are independently managed is an important aspect of democracy.  Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke referred earlier to the activities of the late James Tully, a former Minister for Local Government.  In his day, another former Deputy and Minister for Local Government, the late Kevin Boland, also wielded a rather crude axe on constituencies in the interests of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Let us say that former Members on both sides of the House did hatchet jobs on constituencies.  The important point is that the most recent review was carried out in as open and transparent a manner as possible. The commission sought, and received, many different views from members of the public and political parties.  I agree with Deputy Joan Burton that when the commission issues its preliminary report, it would be a good democratic exercise to <Col N="928"/>hold a public meeting where people could make their views known to the commission on it.  It would allow the commission to take on board the public&rsquo;s views in an open and transparent way.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Louth constituency from which I have been elected.  I welcome the 17,500 constituents from that part of Meath East which will become part of the Louth constituency.  It would be important to change the name of the constituency from Louth to Louth-Meath East to acknowledge the people from an adjoining county who, fortunately for them, are better at football than those from Louth.  I believe they would like to retain their county identity within the larger constituency of Louth.</P>
        <P>All these changes are happening because of growth in the population, particularly along the east coast.  County boundaries date back to early medieval times but counties no longer have the same focus they once had, particularly those along the east coast.  What one has are growth centres around major towns and industrial centres.  The people of Meath and Louth often use the same hospital, attend the same schools, shop in the same shops and go to the same churches.  Crossing county boundaries is an important and significant step.  As stated in the directive to the commission, that should only happen in exceptional circumstances.  Nevertheless, it is probably good for the region, certainly the area around Drogheda, that there is more cohesion among the communities living and using the facilities in the town.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cuffe spoke about the local government boundaries.  The town of Drogheda has run out of land and it is fully developed in every respect.  County Meath is located on one side of the River Boyne while County Louth is on the other side.  Three local authorities are responsible for civil and local administration in the area.  That is a pretty poor set up because it leads to weak local government, lack of clarity in development plans, confusion about what is happening and shopping developments not being welcome in one part of the constituency but literally on one&rsquo;s doorstep in other parts of it.  There are serious issues in regard to planning and development.</P>
        <P>I am not arguing that local government boundaries should change as a result of constituency reviews but places like Drogheda along the east coast are becoming cities.  The population of Drogheda is deemed to be more than 30,000 people.  We need a better local government system and better local control in the surrounding area than that which exists.</P>
        <P>Expanding the boundaries of the administrative local area is a critical issue which needs to be addressed.  It must be done in such a way as to recognise those people living in Meath with a loyalty to Meath County Council and those living in Drogheda with a loyalty to Louth County Council.</P>
        <P>One must look at the growth of towns like Drogheda which are becoming cities.  We must put in place a system which allows them to have a uniform and accountable system of local government which is real and representative, which accounts for the economic activity and interests in the area and which moves away from local decisions which are no longer relevant to the constituency.</P>
        <P>I am a Deputy who will gain an area close to me rather than lose one.  I taught in a school in the area for over 25 years.  I have strong links with County Meath from where my wife&rsquo;s people come and where her late father taught.  I look forward to serving the people who I know so well, people, in particular from the Dublin area, who are new to the area and the emigrants from County Louth who are living in County Meath who will have the privilege of voting for me and for the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kirk.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="929"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very serious issue for my constituency.  I do not believe any constituency has been more negatively affected than Dublin North.  We are losing Portmarnock which may make some geographic sense but, nonetheless, I am sorry I will no longer have the pleasure of representing Carrick Hill, Torcaill, Ardilaun, the Dunes and Beechwood to mention but a few places.  At least one can say there is some geographic sense to that in that it is an integral unit.</P>
        <P>However, what beggars belief and what has upset everybody in my constituency &mdash; not only those who live in Swords but also those who live outside it &mdash; is that they do not understand why the capital of Fingal has been virtually split in two, although it may be one third to two thirds.  The bottom line is that 13,000 people will, for all intents and purposes, be disenfranchised.  They will be at the tail of Dublin West dislocated by a large land mass from the rest of the urban population in Dublin West.  The fear is that they will not get the representation they should.  Despite the best of intentions, and we all know the road to hell is paved with good intentions, they will not get the same service they currently receive.  Furthermore, a county councillor will serve two Deputies.  How will that work?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Important as this is for the people of Dublin North, it beggars belief that after three and a half months off and with the economy in a state of chassis and worsening by the day, the Government refused to allow a two-day debate on the economy.  There are far more pressing issues.  This issue could have been dealt with in the next two to three years before the next general election.  The Fair Deal scheme has not been delivered despite promises made before last Christmas, last Easter and last summer.  People have sold their homes.  Others have no money left, so where do they go?  Transplant legislation is badly needed and was discussed on the radio today.  The secondary school in Donabate is afraid it will be left with a temporary dwelling instead of having a proper school.  Legislation may be required to establish a patient safety authority which is becoming more relevant as more problems in the health service come to light.  There is a need for people to be able to approach, confidentially, an authority which will be an advocate for them without the glare of publicity and without recourse to the courts.</P>
        <P>To come back to the Swords area, how will Fingal County Council operate?  My colleague, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, mentioned that Drogheda was becoming a city with a population of 30,000.  The population of Swords has exceeded 40,000 people.  There are great plans afoot with a very visionary county council which wants a university and a hospital and which has plans for a cultural centre, more shopping areas and a civic centre.  This area will be split arbitrarily.  It does not make sense.</P>
        <P>I accept the commission is an independent body but independent or otherwise, human error, as we know only too well from the health service, is always with us.  I have a sense that the commission has got this wrong.  It has certainly got it wrong from the perspective of the people who live in Swords who are very upset, including those who live in River Valley, Boroimhe, Ridgewood, Knocksedan Demesne, Highfields, Hawthorne Park, the Nurseries and Burrow Court and the Forest Road.  They feel disenfranchised and cut off.</P>
        <P>I hope that before the general election, these people can be brought back into the constituency in which they were and that they can continue to be represented by the representatives who are there currently or those they may choose in the future.  They should not be hived off where their voices will be lost in the wilderness of the other side of Dublin West.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
        <P>In early July my Department published a technical economic update which set out forecasts for 2008, based on the latest information available at that time.  On this basis, unemployment was expected to average 5.8%, or in numerical terms some 132,000 during 2008.  This compares to unemployment of 4.5% or 101,000 over the 2007 period.</P>
        <P>At the end of this month, as is usual, my Department will make its six-monthly return to EUROSTAT setting out the overall fiscal position, including the general Government balance for the years up to 2007 and my Department&rsquo;s forecast for 2008.  This forecast will take account of the latest fiscal information available at that time.</P>
        <P>In announcing the bringing forward of budget 2009, I stated that my Department&rsquo;s latest assessment indicated a tax shortfall significantly in excess of that previously expected for 2008.  September is a key month for tax revenue and while we do not have full month data yet, early indications suggest that the poor performance in tax receipts witnessed over the summer months is continuing.  My Department is closely monitoring overall tax performance in the run-up to the budget.</P>
        <P>My Department will publish an updated view on expected tax and Exchequer positions at the end of this quarter.  A comprehensive assessment of the fiscal and economic position will be contained in the budget which will be published on 14 October 2008.  As is normal, I will not comment on the contents of the budget in advance of that date.</P>

	<P>In light of today&rsquo;s figures from the CSO, how does it feel to be the first Minister for Finance in 25 years to have to report a recession to the people?  Does the Minister still maintain that the collapse we are experiencing in Ireland has to do with international events when the evidence from the CSO today categorically shows that the fall is far more acute in Ireland than in any other country?  As recently as last week, every other country still forecast healthy growth in 2008, but we are now in recession and are heading towards very grim figures.</P>
        <P>Does the Government accept responsibility for the fundamental change that has occurred in the model that underpinned the Celtic tiger?  That model was based on high export growth, tight management of budget balances, high productivity and high competitiveness.  Does the Minister accept responsibility in any shape or form for the horrendous decline in the key figures for all of those areas?  They were the hallmarks of the Celtic tiger that brought so much success to the country, but they have been destroyed.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="931"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept they have been destroyed, but I accept responsibility as Minister for Finance for ensuring those fundamentals are improved and enhanced in the years ahead.  With regard to the cause of our current position, Ireland is an exceptionally open economy and the deterioration in the global climate in the past year has had a major impact here.  We are more exposed to global trends than many other economies.  The pace of growth in our main trading partners has slowed and this has had an impact on our export performance.  The application of the exchange rate also has an effect as a significant part of our trade is outside the euro area.  Developments in the euro-sterling bilateral rate are of special importance given our proximity to the United Kingdom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We are three weeks away from the budget and various leaks have suggested there will be a deficit of up to &euro;5 billion.  The Minister has just said the tax returns for September &mdash; I presume the Minister gets weekly or more frequent returns &mdash; are continuing.  Does this suggest we are now looking at a deficit of up to &euro;7 billion, 7% unemployment and 300,000 people unemployed by the end of the year?  Does the Minister agree that now we have the &ldquo;R&rdquo; word or the tag &ldquo;recession&rdquo; officially added to the tag of the Irish economy?  Is this where Cowenomics has brought us?  This is what the slump coalition has delivered in 15 months and there are 46,000 more people unemployed since Deputy Brian Cowen became Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that it was the stoking of the property bubble by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, that caused the Cowen recession in Ireland?  We know there is a generally difficult international economic climate, but the Irish recession is worse, steeper and will, possibly, last longer because this Minister&rsquo;s predecessor fed the property bubble with property-based tax breaks long after their sell-by date.  Does the Minister agree that the bursting of the property bubble, caused by Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy Brian Cowen, is the cause of mayhem in our economy and has caused grave uncertainty for a number of our financial institutions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Deputy Burton acknowledged a major contribution to the slowdown in our economy has been caused by global factors.  She is correct that domestically a major adjustment to the house building sector is under way, with output likely to decline by at least one third this year.  There are also strong indications of over supply and in these circumstances a further large reduction in output is in prospect next year.  There is growing evidence that the effects of the slowdown in the house building sector has spilled over to other sectors of the economy.  I accept that.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the suggestion that the Taoiseach bears personal responsibility for the slowdown in the housing sector.  The major causative factor for the overheating in the construction sector was the easy supply of credit in recent years here.  That is no longer the case, but it was a major causative factor in that phenomenon.  That factor has come to an end and we have conditions of over supply.  We must deal with the economic challenges we face here and now and not dwell on the possible causative factors for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with the Minister there are difficult external conditions.  However, does he suggest that Ireland&rsquo;s falling share in export markets does not have anything to do with what is happening here?  Is he trying to say our falling competitiveness does not have to do with what has happened here?  Is he trying to say the fact inflation in Ireland was running at almost twice what it was running at in the rest of Europe does not have to do with internal factors?  Was the Government not responsible for the management of those factors? <Col N="932"/> Was it not very foolish to increase public spending at twice the rate of growth of the economy?  Was it not very foolish to rely on the revenue coming from the property bubble to support those spending figures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did.  There is some moderation in demand because of the position in other markets, not because of a position created by the fundamental factors here. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The fundamental factors regarding exports of our goods and services are soundly based.  The difficulties that have arisen have arisen in the construction and banking sectors and have international causes.  That situation is visible to all.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Minister refuse to publish the pre-budget outlook this year?  Last year, when Deputy Brian Cowen was still Minister for Finance, he praised the publication of a pre-budget outlook as a major reform and improvement in transparency and accountability of the public finances.  The Minister and his officials must have a very good idea of the spending plans by Department at this time or they do not deserve to be in their jobs.  If they were in the private sector and in charge of a major corporation with &euro;56 billion in revenues &mdash; falling &mdash; coming into the company and could not, four months before the end of the year and three weeks before their budget, tell us the expected figures, they would be sacked.  Is the Minister working on a similar strategy to Charlie McCreevy&rsquo;s disastrous trick of introducing decentralisation like pulling a rabbit out of a hat?  Nobody knew the figures and it took time to make an assessment of his plan, which turned out to be one of the worst of the many follies and vanities of the Celtic tiger.  It caused gross confusion in the Civil Service and significant increases in the number of public servants employed when resources and head offices were duplicated.  Is the Minister planning a similar trick for budget day?  Will he just pull the figures out of a hat?  We are going to hear them as he stands up and the capacity to make an assessment will only be delayed by a few hours.  Is he going to waste several vital weeks in terms of setting a course for stability and recovery for our economy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Deputy Burton that I am not wasting vital weeks.  The reason for bringing forward the budget to Tuesday, 14 October is the gravity of the situation in terms of our national finances and this year&rsquo;s deteriorating economic position.  That deterioration has been reflected in a sharp reduction in forecast tax revenues.  I appreciate that Deputy Burton and, I am sure, Deputy Bruton would wish to be better informed of the fundamental economic framework prior to budget day.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  his intentions regarding funds held by the pension trustees of certain non-commercial State sponsored bodies in view of his letter proposing a full guarantee of pensions by the State and a transfer of funds; and the way the transfer will be accounted for in terms of general Government borrowing in 2009.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[31745/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Discussions are in train with the trustees and administrators of the funded pension schemes of the five older universities and certain non-commercial semi-State bodies, SSBs, which have funded pension schemes with a view to providing consistency and clarity for the future in terms of meeting the liabilities of the schemes.  This follows consideration some time ago of the pension difficulties facing those universities by a working group under the Higher Education Authority, which recommended such discussions.  The background is that all funded schemes must now meet minimum funding standards under EU law unless they are covered by the State.  This has presented problems for the universities and non-commercial SSBs with funded pension schemes where the State ultimately carries the liability but where this is not clear enough to warrant exemption under EU law.  In that context, and provided all the schemes concerned agree, it is proposed that the assets of those schemes would be transferred to the State with the liabilities, which would then be effectively met effectively by the State on a pay-as-you-go basis in the future.  The terms and conditions of the schemes would be neither better nor worse than what the members would be entitled to anyway.  If agreement is reached, legislation to give effect to the proposal would be required. </P>
        <P>I am informed that the estimated value of the assets of the funds in question at the end of 2007 was in the region of &euro;2.3 billion but this will have changed in the interim and is subject to market fluctuations.  As regards the impact on the public finances, under current EUROSTAT rules the transfer of the assets would impact positively on the general Government balance, GGB, when received.  This initial revenue would be offset in the future by the payment of pension benefits which would be recorded as Government expenditure at the time of payment.  The effect on the GGB when the assets are received is clearly identified as being once off in the national accounts and the underlying GGB is, therefore, still unaffected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is proposing creative accounting.  I want an assurance that he will not use the proposal as a mechanism to borrow further.  Will he confirm that the transfer will have a positive impact on the general Government balance of &euro;2.3 billion?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Borrowing plans are not being formulated in light of the existence of this fund.  The details of the borrowing in which we will have to engage next year are a matter for the Budget Statement but, as far as this matter is concerned, discussions with the relevant institutions are at a preliminary stage.  I am sure Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell has noted from my reply that a difficulty exists in EU law which must be addressed.  The position of the Exchequer in regard to the payment of these pensions in the future is cost neutral. We may have to engage in an exercise involving the consolidation of the existing assets of the colleges with the Exchequer or other relevant designated parts of the public financial system under the direction of my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I find it incredible that as the budget is less than two weeks away the Minister has not yet decided the level of borrowing.  He speaks about instilling confidence in the economy but he cannot answer a straightforward question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a misrepresentation.  This runs contrary to his advice to the private sector in terms of properly funded pension schemes.  He is taking over assets and unquantifiable liabilities.  Will the pension liabilities he is taking from the semi-State non-commercial bodies be put under the management of the National Treasury Management Agency?  Will he give us an assurance this is not being used as a mechanism to enable the Government to borrow recklessly while appearing to satisfy the EU&rsquo;s general borrowing requirements?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I made clear to Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell in my first supplementary reply to this question, discussions on this matter are at a preliminary stage.  It is not my practice or, indeed, the practice of any previous Minister to disclose the borrowing plans that may be disclosed in the Budget Statement and I do not propose to do so at this stage.  I have pointed out to the Deputy that plans in regard to this matter are at a preliminary stage and will involve discussions and legislation which will be distinct from the Finance Acts.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Maintenance of the overall stability of the Irish financial system is a central priority of the Government.  Since August 2007 the international financial system has been affected by unprecedented turmoil and dislocation.  Credit markets, which are pivotal to meeting the medium-term funding needs of the financial system, have effectively closed since August 2007.  Interbank lending rates for shorter maturities have increased significantly, raising the cost of finance to financial institutions.  Difficulties created by impairments of sub-prime securities have adversely impacted on the European and US financial systems, as demonstrated by recent developments in the US.  This has led to major uncertainty for the global financial system.</P>
        <P>The prompt actions by international central banks, including the European Central Bank, to provide major injections of liquidity have contributed to greater stability in financial markets internationally, although they continue to remain subject to significant uncertainties.  Agreement on the extensive and far-reaching plans announced recently by the US authorities should help to stabilise financial markets and rebuild confidence in the international financial system.  Ireland, as a small, highly open economy with a significant financial sector closely integrated into the international financial system, cannot be immune from these developments.  Therefore, the Government has been very active in supporting public confidence in the safety of deposits and the stability of the financial system overall.  I welcome Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s support for my announcement on 20 September that the Government had decided to increase the statutory limit for the deposits guarantee scheme for banks and building societies from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 per depositor per institution and that the cover will apply to 100% of each individual&rsquo;s deposit up to the &euro;100,000 limit.  This guarantee level, which will also apply to credit union savers, is now among the highest in the EU.</P>
        <P>As I stated at the time, the Government is committed to the stability of our financial system, so that money placed with an Irish credit institution would not be at risk.  The Irish Government wants to protect the whole financial system and secure its stability.  As far as meetings with the parties referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question are concerned, this is a normal part of my role as Minister for Finance, given my responsibilities for the financial sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s expression of thanks for my support.  I asked his predecessor for this 11 months ago so it is a little tardy in arriving.</P><Col N="936"/>
        <P>Is the Minister confident he has all the necessary legal means to deal with an emergency such as the need for consolidation, as has been required in other jurisdictions, and that there would be no legal impediments such as regulations relating to competition?  Is he confident he and the regulators in the Central Bank have a firm handle on the banks which have loans under intensive scrutiny?  We need reassurance that the banks are taking necessary steps to secure extra capital if that is what is needed to meet the challenges arising out of those loans.  Would he consider asking the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland to publish a financial stability report now, so that there will be an analytic basis for the confidence we all express in our financial system?</P>
        <P>Will the Government call in the banks, as has happened in other jurisdictions, to ensure the needs of business are not unduly hampered by credit restrictions?  We need a partnership approach involving Government, regulator and banks to make sure we emerge from this crisis in a robust state and able to support enterprise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Bruton.  We must have a partnership approach with the banks, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, the last two of which have statutory responsibilities in this area.  The Deputy asked about the timing of the announcement on deposits but I have kept this matter under review since my appointment as Minister for Finance.  It is very difficult to determine an appropriate date to make such an announcement but the close of banking business last weekend gave me an adequate opportunity to do so.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked questions on the stability of the financial system and I can confirm that the relevant emergency and contingency planning has taken place within my Department.  In the unlikely event of any contingency being necessary my Department and I will be in a position to advise the Government on the appropriate steps to be taken.  Deputy Bruton will be aware that the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator have distinct statutory responsibilities and the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service questioned the Governor of the Central Bank on the banking system during the course of the summer.  Both the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator are in regular discussion with my Department about the stability of the financial sector and maintain close surveillance and constant monitoring of it.</P>
        <P>Liquidity, the availability of funds in banks and the extent to which the absence of those funds can impact on the economy are important matters which are raised periodically by Ministers for Finance with the relevant financial institutions.  I do not want to go into details of the discussions I have held with those institutions but I share Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s concern that such issues should be high on the list of priorities at those meetings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>A stability report might form one element of a package of measures to generate ongoing confidence in the sector but I would not like to commit myself this afternoon to the publication of a particular report.

	<P>I had an opportunity on the margins of the recent informal ECOFIN meeting in France to exchange views with Commissioner Almunia, who is responsible for the economic and monetary affairs directorate.  I outlined how domestic and international factors have impacted on the Irish economy, most notably in the rapidity of the downturn and its significant impact on tax revenues.  I advised that my Department&rsquo;s formal estimate of the outturn for the general Government balance for 2008 would be provided in the fiscal notifications to be submitted by all member states at the end of this month and subsequently published by EUROSTAT in late October.  The Department&rsquo;s estimates for 2008 and beyond will be set out in the budget on 14 October.  </P>
        <P>I also informed Commissioner Almunia of the actions taken to date by the Government, including the rationale for those actions and their intended effects.

	<P>In a recent EU Commission report on public finances in the EU Ireland was ranked a distant last in the area of public management of finances.  It was also ranked last and received no score in the area of prudent economic assumptions, which judges how we create leeway for a slowdown and make forecasts.  Does he agree that the assumptions in the budget were ludicrous?  The budget forecast GDP growth at 3%, that there would be 24,000 new jobs and that there would be 1% more in employment.  It also forecast that inflation would be below the EU average of 2.4% but it is now 3.2%.  It was also stated that there would be 55,000 house completions.  The Minister said house completions would be down by one third on last year but that would mean approximately 52,000 completions so the figures do not add up.  </P>
        <P>The Minister says he will not provide figures on the Government deficit until budget day.  He will provide the figures to the EU by the end of this month but his primary responsibility is to the D&aacute;il and the Houses of the Oireachtas.

	<P>The Deputy asked a wide range of questions.  The report submitted to the EU is one that is submitted every year.  I would be delighted to assist Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell, as I offered to assist Deputies Bruton and Burton, in furnishing all relevant economic data and forecasts which will be in the possession of my Department in early October, so that we can all discuss an appropriate budget for Ireland.  I appreciate that Members on the other side of the House want to be informed as comprehensively as possible about the forecasts my Department will make for 2009.  I do not have a difficulty furnishing to the Deputy the maximum possible amount of information in my possession in <Col N="938"/>regard to forecasting, subject to the constraint in respect of confidentiality of strictly budgetary matters.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 35 and 67 together.</P>
        <P>The questions relate to the publication of a revised statement on the capital expenditure programme.  I am currently considering the issues relating to capital investment under the national development plan, NDP, in the context of the forthcoming budget.  The question of publishing revised multi-annual capital envelopes will also be considered in that context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister publish cost-benefit analyses on the projects selected to proceed so that we can have confidence that robust projects are being selected?  Will the cost-benefit analysis include some form of independent auditing to ensure we do not end up with the type of rose-tinted analysis often produced by parent Departments and will we have an opportunity to debate these in the House?</P>
        <P>Is the national development plan dead in terms of the capital projections committed to when it was published?  Are the projections which represented approximately &euro;184 billion overall now gone?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The national development plan stands.  The Government has made clear that implementation of the plan must be phased over a longer period.  It will not be possible to implement the plan within the original envisaged timescale.  Therefore, it will be necessary to extend the period during which it will be implemented.</P>
        <P>It is important in that context to identify which elements of the plan should be prioritised.  In regard to the request from Deputy Bruton for a debate in the House on that matter, such debate can take place in the context of the budgetary debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what I asked the Minister.  I want protection from the Chair to ensure the questions I ask are answered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has no control over the answers given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked if a cost-benefit analysis will be undertaken and if it will be published.  It is only then that I will be interested in a debate.  I do not want a free rolling debate with backbenchers being rolled in to read out speeches off a word processor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Bruton is being rather unfair to the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have backbenchers from all parties who work off word processors and, happily, many who do not.</P>
        <P>On the specific question, the Government will examine the capital priorities for next year and ensuing years and will determine priorities in relation to them.  There has been considerable analyses and cost-benefit exercises in respect of many of these projects.  As regards projects which are off balance in strict capital expenditure terms and are subject to the public private partnership system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;whatever the merits or demerits of the particular financing mechanism involved.  On projects which come strictly within the public capital programme, my predecessor introduced many cost-benefit measures to ensure greater value for money in relation to these projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is reneging on what he said on radio, namely, that he is open to publishing these reports.  He is foot stepping the issue.</P>

	<P>I would like an opportunity to reply to Deputy Bruton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will have plenty of time later to reply.  I call Deputy Joan Burton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister decided what will be the total spend on the national development plan?  Does he, unlike former Fianna F&aacute;il Governments which, in the late 1970s, borrowed for consumption and led us on the road of economic ruin, propose to borrow to invest in the national development plan?</P>
        <P>Will public transport and education issues be prioritised in the national development plan if revised?  Is the Minister proposing to axe metro west and to downsize metro north?  Will he agree that both decisions would be incredibly foolish and short term if the objective is to return us to competitiveness and economic growth?</P>
        <P>I must confess that like former Deputy Charlie McCreevy, I am only a bean counter; I am not an economist or senior counsel.  Multinational companies around the world carry out a rating score in regard to investment.  What does that type of score do for Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and employment?  Also, what is the cost of the project and the borrowing requirements in that regard?</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke earlier about public private partnerships.  The problem with PPPs, as the Minister should know from his earlier reply about banks, is that the cost to private investors of raising finance, owing to the absence of liquidity, has risen significantly.  The Minister&rsquo;s comments leave me, a mere bean counter, with some degree of fear and trepidation.  The Minister should forget about fancy words like &ldquo;cost-benefit analysis&rdquo; and set out, in language that those of us who are not economists or senior counsel can understand, how he is rating the proposed investments in the national development plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, the Deputy is far from being a humble bean counter; she is a qualified accountant, which is a qualification of some repute.</P>
        <P>On the national development plan, the Government must make decisions as part of the budgetary process.  Deputy Burton will appreciate such decisions are confidential.  The Government will be informed by the considerations available to it in that regard.  I have stated, prior to any consideration of these matters by Government, that the question of stimulating productive investment in the economy must be fundamental in assessing the priorities for this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Minister answer my question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">Will the Minister state in simple layman&rsquo;s terms what type of cost-benefit analysis is provided within the various Departments in regard to NDP projects?  There is a lack of transparency on the part of the Government in this regard.  The Minister for Finance is guardian of the public purse.  People are entitled to know how their money is being spent.  We need the Minister to tell us today how that is being done.  As stated earlier by Deputy Bruton, the Minister appears to be reneging on the commitment he gave on the national airwaves in respect of the publication of the cost-benefit analysis.  What procedures are in place to ensure this information is put into the public domain and will the Minister give a commitment today that this analysis will be brought before the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are extensive procedures in operation throughout the public administration of this State for the cost-benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is waffling.  He should answer the question.</P>

	<P>Please allow the Minister to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I made it clear that there are ample procedures within the public administration of this State for the cost-benefit analysis of many different projects.  For example, for educational investment at primary or second level, the specifications for buildings of that type have been established by long tradition.  With regard to cost-benefit analysis, as Deputies from all sides of the House know, the demand for particular schools becomes visible, and then with regard to the actual cost of the project, tenders are invited and a proper procedure is followed.  There may be some projects of a wider character, to which I assume Deputy Bruton was referring in our recent discussion on the subject, on whose cost-benefit analyses he believes he does not have adequate information.  I made it clear that if there was such information I would of course make it available.  It is important that we have a detailed consideration of the costs and benefits of any project in which taxpayers&rsquo; money is an issue.  However, I emphasise that the projects within the capital development plans of the Government, or of any government, are subject to rigorous cost-benefit analysis within the public administration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I looked to see whether Deputy Bruton was indicating and he was not, but he now is, so I will allow him a question after Deputy Burton.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="942"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister propose to borrow for the national development plan, and what scale of borrowing does he envisage?  I refer to borrowing for investment as opposed to borrowing for current consumption.</P>
        <P>How does he propose to rate the different proposals in the national development plan?  I have likened these before to a big souffl&eacute;.  Now the oven door is open and souffl&eacute; is sinking rapidly.  The Minister must decide which are the priority areas.  How will he rate them?  Will it be on the basis of the employment they create or the increase in competitiveness that results from them?  Will he prioritise projects that help the economy to grow, or will it be based on their overall cost and their implications for borrowing?  I have said before and I will say again that I am quite concerned about the Minister&rsquo;s comments on PPPs.  Due to the lack of liquidity in the banking system, the cost of borrowing for private equity institutions has risen astronomically, while Ireland, as a country, can borrow much more cheaply, even though our rating is going down after today.  Can the Minister say what he is planning to do?  These are strategically important decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Burton that these are very important strategic decisions, and they will be announced in the budget.  The overall amount of borrowing that can be engaged in by the State will also be announced in the budget.  It will not be announced in the House this afternoon.  It is clear from the figures disclosed to date that borrowing will have to take place for investment in capital programme next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will share my scepticism at the Minister&rsquo;s silky assurances that everything in the Department of Finance is carefully assessed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot attribute any attitude to the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not do so.  I ask the Minister whether the &euro;900 million for the decentralisation programme was carefully assessed in the Department.  Was the &euro;52 million spent on e-voting carefully assessed in the Department, or the &euro;160 million on PPARS?  I could go on and list all the projects we see year in, year out in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Let us be honest with ourselves; the robust assessment that the Minister talks about does not occur.  We need to make it happen, and this House is charged with that duty.  The sooner these assessments are published and held up to public scrutiny, so that people are held accountable, the better for this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

	<P>What assessment was done before the politicians took the decision?</P>

	<P>I have never heard that the Deputy&rsquo;s party opposed that particular Government decision unequivocally or opposed the locations selected by the then Government for decentralisation.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he will ensure that all of his appointments to State bodies will be tabled for consideration by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31481/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The arrangements for appointments to the boards of State bodies are normally set out in the legislation establishing the bodies in question and are designed to ensure efficient management of the organisation.  Appointments to the boards are generally made by the Minister with responsibility for the body in question, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>In making appointments, Ministers seek to ensure that the people appointed bring a diverse range of relevant skills and experience to the body.  Ministers also take account of any specific legislative or policy requirements, such as those contained in the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts or the Government&rsquo;s policy on gender balance on the boards of State bodies.  Where appropriate, Ministers may also consider representation from different strands of society such as the business community, consumers, trade unions or the other social partners.</P>
        <P>I am generally happy that the present arrangements, which follow the practice of previous Governments, work well and that people with the required skills and experience are appointed to State boards.  Nevertheless, I recognise that it might be useful to give some thought to involving committees of the House in appointments to some boards.  This is an issue some of my colleagues have examined with regard to boards under their remit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the Minister intends to put some thought into this, but I hope it does not suffer the fate of his thoughts about publishing evaluations.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister not agree that we would be much more assured of the quality of the people appointed if we had some level of assessment by an Oireachtas committee?  I am not talking about a Star Chamber, but an Oireachtas committee which will have accountability in scrutinising these appointments.</P>
        <P>We are at a critical time in terms of dealing with the Central Bank and Financial Regulator.  Is the Minister confident, looking at the boards of these bodies, that they have the necessary skill, expertise and experience to handle the challenges we face and protect taxpayers&rsquo; interests?  This issue is particularly acute for the Minister, as he appoints board members of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  Is the Minister satisfied and confident that we have that expertise in place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course I have full confidence in the authorities referred to by the Deputy, although he will appreciate that I did not appoint the persons in question.  However, I have confidence in the operation of these authorities.  If it falls to me to make appointments I will of course take great care in doing so, as they are of great importance in the financial administration of the State.  However, I have no reason to lack confidence in these boards or authorities as a Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the more general question of appointments, there is an issue of whether suitable persons would come forward if they were to be subjected to the Star Chamber of committee interrogation in the House.  This is something on which we should reflect in deciding whether we want to go down that route.  There is also the more general issue that a harmonious relationship between a board and a government is desirable, irrespective of the political colour <Col N="944"/>of that government.  The fact that the appointment is made by a government does ensure that the appointee understands the special relationship that necessarily exists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spoke about diversity with regard to appointments to political boards.  Does the Minister agree that after 11 years of Fianna F&aacute;il in government, what most people think of in terms of diversity in State boards is the diversity of Fianna F&aacute;il cumainn represented by many of the board members?  That is, unfortunately, what people have begun to see.  Historically, that may be a consequence, as I said, of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s 11 years in government.  However, there has been an extraordinary increase in the number of bodies.  Depending on how one counts them, we now have up to 800 boards, quangos and task forces of every kind.  Does the Minister agree that it is now very difficult to get competent people to serve on boards?  Does he agree that it is necessary to reform the appointment process?  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, may have picked someone who is good at maths to be an adviser on education, but does the Minister not think he might have been better advised to have a departmental official indicate the qualifications required to be an adviser on the costs of third level education?</P>

	<P>I would deplore any tendency in that regard.  Participation in political parties of every type, description and orientation is an important part of the public life of the State and should be esteemed rather than devalued.  That is important in making appointments to boards.  I do not accept the proposition that because a person is a member of a political party it somehow necessarily disqualifies him or her from appointment.  That persons have shown public spirit to be involved in politics tends to qualify rather than disqualify them for appointment.  However, I accept the point that we need to be exceptionally careful about these appointments.  I am open to suggestions as to how we might improve the method of appointment.</P>

	<P>The Minister has pointed to the general criteria that apply to appointments to State bodies and boards.  Does he agree that the CSO report on gender representation shows that there is an appalling record, with only 34% of appointees to State boards being female?  Does he have proposals to address that problem?</P>
        <P>Regarding greater transparency in appointments, I agree with the Minister that membership of a political party should not disqualify a person.  However, I certainly do not believe it should be the only criterion by which a person qualifies, which is often the case, as we have seen in the course of the Government and previous ones.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s aspiration for a role for Oireachtas committees on that basis.  However, for this to happen would we not require some form of legislative initiative to ensure it would be a mandatory requirement for people to appear before an Oireachtas committee in order to be screened thoroughly?</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I outlined to Deputy Bruton on 4 June, it is important that the Oireachtas should engage with evaluation of spending programmes under the value for money initiative.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the orders of reference for the select committees of the 30th D&aacute;il specifically encompass consideration of the reviews completed under this initiative.  The Deputy will also be aware that my predecessor wrote to the Chairmen of all D&aacute;il select committees on 1 February this year encouraging them to ensure the committees schedule time to consider value for money and policy reviews in detail and, where appropriate, to discuss the reviews and their conclusions and recommendations with the relevant Department.  This approach, combined with the submission of annual output statements to the select committees, facilitates enhanced scrutiny and evaluation of the Estimates by the D&aacute;il and ensures accountability for what is being achieved with the moneys approved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister evaded the question which was whether he would allow the Oireachtas to initiate the evaluation.  We represent the people who use public services and see good and bad.  The issue for us is that several other parliaments have very strong evaluation arms available to them.  They carry out serious evaluations of performance and are backed in doing that work.  The Government has a system, whereby the agencies themselves carry out the evaluations and decide what should be evaluated.  It is not open to public scrutiny here, which needs to be reversed.  The Houses of the Oireachtas should be in the driving seat in cross-examining the extent to which value is being achieved.  That would be a useful change that the Minister should consider.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am certainly open to considering it, although the public accounts process encompasses some of what the Deputy is referring to regarding the evaluation of value for money.  A perusal of the report submitted by the Comptroller and Auditor General makes that very clear.  Regarding the specific value for money initiative we are discussing, the practice to date has been that the Government identifies its priorities for review and reports on the findings of these reviews to the Oireachtas to which it is accountable.  The review is being conducted within the executive arm of government and it will be submitted to the committee <Col N="946"/>for evaluation.  Through the Committee of Public Accounts, in the context of the evaluation of spending, this Parliament has the facility to consider these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the development of Government bodies &mdash; quangos &mdash; does the Minister believe it would be possible in current form for D&aacute;il committees to examine public bodies seriously?  I will give an example to which the Minister referred.  The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland issues regular reports and its representatives appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  On their last visit some months ago they were questioned robustly by me and others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I read the transcript.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>They were also questioned on previous occasions about what they were doing to ensure the stability of the banking system and, in particular, asked to ensure we would not be overexposed to risky practices in lending to developers to purchase land.  We received the vaguest answers to very specific questions such as what was the accounting treatment of the interest payments on loans to developers for land banks.  We could not get an answer from them.  Had they answered the result would have been that they would have exercised more control over the lending policies of banks to developers for inflated land prices.  However, nothing happened because essentially the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service was spancelled in carrying out an inquiry.  There is considerable language about output statements which are meaningless unless they get to the point.  Does the Minister not agree?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy began by raising the question of the 800 agencies.  My views on the matter are well known.  It is under consideration in the budgetary process.  I agree that our public administration has become far too fragmented and divided.  The Deputy used the term &ldquo;quango&rdquo; in reference to these bodies and agencies, all of which are not quangos in the sense that clearly the Central Bank is an institution that every civilised country must have in its monetary system.</P>
        <P>During the summer, since the committee conducted that questioning, I read with interest the transcript of the proceedings to which the Deputy referred.  I do not want to comment on the questioning or the answers to the questions.  I was not present at the committee and could not fully judge for myself the character of the persons answering them, but comprehensive answers seem to have been given to many of the questions asked.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Burton raised an important question on the accountability of various bodies to this House.  It is a practice that has been extended in recent years in respect of, for example, the Garda Commissioner and the Central Bank which have made themselves available for scrutiny to committees.  In regard to the financial system and the bodies charged with ensuring financial stability, there is necessarily an element of confidentiality in respect of the operations of such bodies which is essential to maintain the confidence we all have and want to see continued in the banking system.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> his proposals to address the downturn in the economy with particular reference to improving the cost base; if an effort has been made to identify the cause or causes which have to date contributed to a deterioration in the competitiveness of this economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31535/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The deterioration in the economy&rsquo;s competitiveness relative to that of our main trading partners has been driven by a combination of factors.  These include a strong euro, the global rise in commodity prices and wage increases in excess of productivity.  The relatively high rate of inflation we have experienced over the last number of years has also played a role.  At this stage, price levels here are in excess of 20% above the euro area average.</P>
        <P>Improving our competitive position is essential to facilitate a rebalancing of the economy towards more sustainable, export-led growth and to maintain Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a location for inward investment.</P>
        <P>While external factors such as the price of oil and exchange rates have an impact on domestic costs, these are beyond our control.  As such, we must seek to control those costs which we can influence.  We must also take steps to improve productivity.</P>
        <P>In support of these objectives, the Government is committed to maintaining an appropriately low burden of taxation on capital and labour, and has implemented a range of policies aimed at improving competition in product markets and flexibility in the labour market.  Furthermore, despite the recent weakness in the public finances, this Government will continue to prioritise investment under the national development plan that enhances future productivity.  These measures will equip the Irish economy with the skills, infrastructure and operating environment needed so that we can take advantage of the global pick-up when it emerges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While my Department, along with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department and the National Competitiveness Council all take an active role in monitoring competitiveness developments on an ongoing basis, I would point out that national competitiveness is not solely a matter of Government policy.  It is a shared responsibility of all the social partners &mdash; Government, employers and unions.  Regaining our competitive position, which as a small open economy is critical to our economic success, will require each of us to play our part and work together to this end.  This means ensuring that externally driven price increases do not become embedded in our system as that only creates a vicious cycle from which no one wins.  In this respect, the willingness of the various parties to compromise and adopt a realistic approach to wage developments in the recent pay talks is welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I suppose it is the elephant in the room so far as competitiveness is concerned, but can I ask the Minister about the role of sectors that he manages or regulates? <Col N="948"/> Does he accept that half of the inflation generated since 2000, excluding mortgage interest, has been generated by services directly provided or regulated by the Government?  Does he intend to benchmark the competitiveness of services such as waste disposal, electricity and communications?  These are all areas where Ireland has had a much more rapid increase in costs than any other country in the EU zone.  Has the penny dropped with the Government that it is the Minister who manages many of these services and regulates the price increases?  Does he not have a responsibility, therefore, for driving down costs in these key sectors?  This was not mentioned in his reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government collectively has a very important fundamental duty to maintain our cost base under control as much as possible.  My Department does not control the cost of electricity in the State, which is one of the cost factors which bears on our inflation.  We have established as a State an independent system of regulation to determine energy prices.  That independent process is informed by objective characteristics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>We have the highest price for electricity and the highest rate of increase.  Riddle me that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Bruton made the case that I was personally responsible for the price of electricity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister does not have personal responsibility.  The responsibility lies with the public sector, which he manages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to point out that neither I nor my Department is responsible but that the Government collectively has to take the decisions that ensure we have the lowest possible price in the Irish market.  The Deputy referred to inflation in respect of public sector costs generally.  I can assure him that, as Minister for Finance, I keep a very wary eye on any such increases in public expenditure.  It is a fact and an international phenomenon that the costs of health care and the health system are subject to what is called &ldquo;medical inflation&rdquo;.  One suggestion made by Deputy Bruton, which was echoed by Deputy Burton, concerned value for money audits in the health service.  Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell also raised that question.  That is an important issue which the Oireachtas should examine.  I certainly would be interested in discussing that with the Opposition spokespersons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of preparing for the budget, has the Minister taken the opportunity to look at comparative costs for public services in other countries?  For example, one can visit a doctor in France and expect to pay &euro;20 or &euro;30 and proportionate amounts, perhaps, &euro;70 or &euro;80 to visit a consultant, whereas in Ireland the cost of a visit to a doctor, unless one has a medical card, would be at least 100% higher and in the case of a visit to a consultant probably 500% higher.  The Government along with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has been encouraging an aggressive introduction of private for-profit medicine into the Irish health sector.  We have had a private health sector for a long time but it was largely not-for-profit, religiously-based involving various denominations.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister agree that the private for-profit health sector in Ireland is charging what the market will bear?  The costs that are being charged for private health services in Ireland are almost at the top end of the range in terms of the European Union, often with dramatically less quality, as is clear from the very sad inquests we have read recently, than the comparative European standard of delivery.  This is where the Minister&rsquo;s take on competitiveness and costs comes into play.  I wish the Minister well in his job but how does he propose to get his Depart<Col N="949"/>ment to analyse and deal with this type of inflation which happens all the time in regard to costs in Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the health service, primary responsibility for the formulation of proposals rests with the Minister for Health and Children.  The matter is collectively considered by the Government at regular intervals.  In regard to the costs of the health service, I do not accept Deputy Burton&rsquo;s assumption that the for-profit sector is necessarily more expensive than the public sector provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister used it?  How many of his consultants use it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The public sector provision also carries a considerable cost driven by normative salary rates which are well in excess of those of many of our European partners at all levels of the service. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister speaks continually about external factors for which he certainly cannot be held responsible.  When we joined the euro we lost control of our exchange rates and interest rates but the one thing we can control is inflation. The Minister is probably aware that international indicators of competitiveness rank us as the worst of the euro countries.  In light of what the National Competiveness Council recommended, that Ireland should try to get its inflation rate well below the EU average, when will the Minister have an inflation policy in place?  What target inflation rates does he expect to put in place?  There is a lack of leadership in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget will provide a framework with regard to our costs and competitiveness for the future.  I do not accept Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s casual reference to the fact that we lost control over our exchange rates when we joined the euro.  The reality is that Ireland has been locked into some form of monetary union since the earliest part of the 19th century.  For a large part of that history we have had no control over our exchange rates and we had a very limited control over these during the short period when we were in the European exchange mechanism from 1979 onwards.  I do not accept this.  It is an important point because we have had a very big debate on Europe&mdash;&mdash; </P>

I do not know who wrote the brief for the Minister today but things have got worse since July.  We have figures regarding unemployment that relate to the end of August and early September and these show 6.1%.  Does the Minister share the analysis of the ESRI that the unemployment rate is likely to hit 7%, a total of 300,000 people, by Christmas?  Does he agree that in the first three months of the new year it is likely to go up by a further 1% to approximately 8%?  That is what the ESRI has stated. </P>
        <P Just="Left">After his appointment the Minister bounded into this Chamber like the Duracell bunny to glorify the ESRI&rsquo;s medium-term forecast.  That was just before the House rose for the summer when the Labour Party called for a debate about the state of the economy.  The Minister was delighted by the ESRI&rsquo;s forecast.  Mr. Barrett of that organisation attended the think-ins of the Labour Party and Fine Gael and perhaps also that of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I believe the ESRI was at all of them.  Mr. Barrett indicated that unemployment would rise to 7% by the end of the year.  That is 300,000 people and a probable rate of 8% to follow.

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his office for allowing this debate.  It is critically important and is a matter of deep concern.  The Dublin Port tunnel is the largest piece of infrastructure in the State and cost over &euro;800 million to build.  The operating system is called Scada &mdash; supervisory control and data system &mdash; and I shall refer to it as such.  </P>
        <P>First, I wish to get the timeline right concerning this issue.  On 15 January there was an early warning to the National Roads Authority, NRA, concerning the safety of the port tunnel.  On 23 January EGIS Tunnels and the NRA met to discuss the safety issues.  On 23 March rigorous testing on safety issues regarding the Scada system commenced.  On 26 March the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport held a meeting which was attended by the NRA.  Representatives were asked specifically about the safety of the tunnel and whether there were any issues in respect of it.  Questioning on this was forensic.  It is my view that the NRA misled the duly appointed Oireachtas committee by not reporting serious issues concerning the safety of the port tunnel.  I contend that the National Roads Authority has no credibility with regard to the transparency of what is going on, and perhaps even with regard to the truth about what is happening in respect of the port tunnel.</P>
        <P>The EGIS report stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The system is unable to ensure the required level of safety.  There were design and operating deficiencies and it had a lack of reliability.  It was inefficient to improve and it would create confusion with the system if that were to happen.  It is unsuitable to ensure safe tunnel operations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Another key issue was the absence of documentation in respect of the system.  Documents on how to run the system, what was there and what was not, were not available.  There was no list of alarms.  This would generate dangerous situations.</P>
        <P>There are very serious problems with the port tunnel.  They have been known to the NRA since at least the beginning of this year.  If Paul Murphy,  a reporter on  &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, had not put this into the public domain we would not know anything about it.  Accountability, credibility and, most of all, safety, are today in the hands of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Noel Ahern.  The safety of the port tunnel is what we are concerned about and how we can ensure that it is safe.  The Minister of State is accountable to us in the House, as the National Roads Authority is accountable to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport about what is happening in this matter.</P>
        <P>The NRA has issued a statement to say that the system is being adjusted or improved.  The conclusions of the EGIS report on the ability of the system to be improved upon are exceptionally clear:</P>
        <P LI="1">Due to its design we conclude that the system will be very difficult to improve and will not be able to accommodate certain improvements listed in a special task order.  Most parts of the Scada will need to be replaced.  The main point of concern is the use of components, material and software, inadequate for real-time monitoring.</P><Col N="952"/>
        <P FLI="0">In support of this the report lists the technical options that can be considered and states that these will result in problems occurring at all levels of the architecture.  They include response times for the commands and status reports, reliability of the communication system and data collection system, legibility and efficiency of the control interfaces, list of alarms, multiple windows and highlighting of important information relating to the structure.  The report also refers to another report, by Martin Kelly, which relates to the network architecture. The choice of equipment and its suitability in the tunnel command control system have also been mentioned.</P>
        <P>There is clear evidence of significant problems in the operating safety of the tunnel.  The NRA has clear knowledge of the matter which it failed to give to the committee.  There is the accountability of the Minister of State for the safety of the port tunnel.  What is he doing about it?  Will he identify in his response what has happened since, particularly in light of the consultants&rsquo; view that the tunnel cannot be improved?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The key points I wish to make to the Minister of State are these.  Has the NRA come to a decision regarding the replacement of the system?  That is what is recommended.  Will it be replaced?  Not to do so will result in enormous expense and cost.  The consultants believe that a replacement of the system should be favoured.  Can the Minister of State vouch for the safety of the system by giving us an assurance from an independent and internationally renowned expert, experts or company, with regard to the current operation and safety of the port tunnel?  We must have that independent assessment. Clearly, the professional advisers concluded in April that it was unsafe but now there has been a change of tune.  We want to ensure it is totally safe and we want the Government to commit to an independent audit.</P>
        <P>I received reports today that the Scada system installed in the port tunnel is regularly freezing, that is to say, it is still malfunctioning.  Will the Minister of State confirm or deny this?  This matter is of incredible national importance as it is crucial for the economy that the port tunnel works.  It is also crucial that people can go through it safely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also call on the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Noel Ahern, to initiate a full independent investigation into all aspects of safety at the Dublin Port tunnel to reassure the 5 million motorists who use it that it is safe.  People need reassurance that, for the 98 or 99% of the time the tunnel has been open since its formal opening, their lives have not been in danger when passing through it.  </P>
        <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, is not here this evening as I feel he has shirked this responsibility again and again.  Like Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, I was involved in an earlier &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; investigation and the Minister refused to report on the matter to this House; he said it was a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA.  This kind of archaic nonsense makes a mockery of the D&aacute;il and the democratic system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like most people, I was shocked by the further allegations made on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme in recent days and the internal EGIS report that RTE made public, which alleged that the Scada safety system was unsuitable to ensure the safe operation of the tunnel and that it generates dangerous situations.  It also alleged that the whole Scada system was deficient and inadequate and should be replaced.  We were assured by Mr. Fred Barry of the NRA, at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, after an earlier series of closures, that the tunnel was absolutely safe.  However, given the recent reports, I have the same doubts and concerns as my Fine Gael colleague.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; investigation came on the back of several other investigations by RTE and the <i>Evening Herald</i>, and there have been distressing allegations that the Dublin fire <Col N="953"/>brigade could not enter the tunnel under certain conditions.  During the no-warning shutdown of the tunnel last February there was mayhem across the greater Dublin area.  Concerns have been aired in the media about alleged unsafe conditions for driving vehicles carrying petrol, diesel and other combustible cargo through the tunnel.  It has also been indicated that parts of the Scada computer system and all 32 pairs of jet fans in the tunnel have been replaced.  Why was that necessary so soon after the opening of the facility?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State address these concerns and outline the contact he has had with the NRA and Dublin City Council regarding the operation of the tunnel?  Will the NRA initiate an additional review of health and safety procedures in the tunnel?  Will the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, order an immediate investigation?  On behalf of the Labour Party I call for one.  Will the Minister, this evening, assure the public that the tunnel is safe?  The Minister must establish a full and independent safety review to completely restore confidence as many drivers no longer wish to use the tunnel because, since the last &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, they consider it to be dangerous.</P>
        <P>There seems to be a poisonous industrial relations atmosphere swirling around some of the allegations and information that have come to the fore.  Many people were shocked to learn that the NRA and Dublin City Council were also planning to launch legal action against Nishimatsu, Mowlem and Irishenco because of the number of alleged serious systems failures.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Councillor Se&aacute;n Kenny, who is chairperson of the Dublin City Council traffic committee, has called for the termination of the Transroute company&rsquo;s contract because of ongoing safety problems.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on this suggestion?</P>
        <P>Given the importance of the port tunnel to Dublin&rsquo;s north side and indeed to the rest of Dublin and the country, it is critical that its safety is clarified through a full, independent investigation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Roads Authority would not allow the tunnel to be operated in circumstances that would compromise the safety of the public.  As the Deputies will know, the Minister for Transport is responsible for policy and funding matters relating to the national road element of Transport 21.  However, the detailed planning, design and implementation of all aspects of individual road improvement schemes, including the safety related aspects of the Dublin Port tunnel, are, under the Roads Act, a matter for the National Roads Authority and the relevant local authority, in this case Dublin City Council.</P>
        <P>Due to this statutory position, neither I nor the Minister, nor his Department, has seen the report in question, which I understand was discussed on a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme.  However, I am satisfied that the National Roads Authority would not allow the port tunnel to be operated in circumstances that would compromise the safety of the public.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand from the NRA that the report referred to in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme concerned tests carried out in March, April and May this year by EGIS Tunnels, the parent company of the tunnel operator, at the request of Transroute and the National Roads Authority, to help ensure that all problems associated with the tunnel&rsquo;s Scada control system were comprehensively identified.  This is not new information, it was known far earlier in the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State said he did not know.  Until RTE got the information nobody knew.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The information was known to the NRA.  While the report offered the view that the Scada system should be replaced, all parties, including EGIS Tunnels, which prepared the report, agreed subsequently that suitable and adequate measures could be taken <Col N="954"/>to address the problems with the existing system, and those measures have been taken.  A critical assessment was given at the time.  It got people talking, including those who conducted the report and that is the fundamental issue.  Things have changed and people are now happy that the changes made adequately address concerns that were raised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the statement issued by EGIS Tunnels on Tuesday, which makes it clear that both before and after completion of the report, mitigation measures were implemented that allow the tunnel to operate safely and, in parallel with this work, other improvements to the system were implemented.  EGIS Tunnels also pointed out in its statement that in the period since March, the tunnel has not experienced any closures linked to performance issues, such as those reported earlier this year.  In particular, it indicated that it is satisfied that the tunnel operator has taken appropriate and sufficient steps, then and now, to allow the tunnel to operate safely.  These steps include the upgrading and replacement of the existing Scada servers, which have dramatically improved system performance, improvements to the equipment maintenance procedures to achieve better equipment performance and additional monitoring of the tunnel through the establishment of an additional dedicated manned CCTV monitoring station in the control room.  This CCTV monitoring station is staffed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and is in addition to the two manned control desks in the tunnel control room, which are manned 24 hours a day.  Other steps include additional drive through patrolling of the tunnel by operator staff and the fact that individual items of equipment have been, and are continuing to be, replaced with newer equipment with improved performance.</P>
        <P>The NRA has assured the Minister that there is no discrepancy between this report and the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s comments to the joint Oireachtas committee earlier this year or, indeed, its comments to RTE.  For example, the fans in the tunnel, when not controlled by the Scada system, were controlled by an independent manual system, which is outside the Scada system.  The control of the fans in the instances referred to was via radio communications, rather than the Scada system.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>That is because the Scada system had failed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme also raised again the question of temporary blockages of the access doors.  As this was mentioned in a previous &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast, it is important the programme now has acknowledged that the doors in question are access doors, not safety doors as originally alleged.  These doors are designed for use by the tunnel operator to be used after, and not during, an incident.  These are huge doors through which one can drive a truck or a fork-lift.  The pedestrian or safety doors are small fire doors through which individuals may pass and are completely different.  Were one to open the access door in the event of a fire or other problem, one would be allowing in oxygen, thus permitting the fire to spread into the other tunnel, which would be lunacy.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In its supervision of the design and construction of the tunnel, the National Roads Authority has always, from the outset, been fully cognisant of the need to ensure the highest standard of safety provision and has taken account of the most up-to-date standards and codes of practice.  Safety has been a primary consideration in the development and implementation of the scheme and the operating, ventilation and safety systems have been designed with safety as a paramount consideration.  A safety audit of the project confirms that the tunnel complies in all respects with the requirements of the recent EU directive on safety in road tunnels.</P>
        <P>The safety procedures in the tunnel are kept under continuous review.  The approach taken represents a comprehensive approach to ensuring the safe passage of vehicles through the <Col N="955"/>tunnel.  It is in line with best international standards.  I emphasise there has not been and will not be any compromise in the safe level of operation of the tunnel.  Any event that arises that could cause such a compromise will result in the immediate closure of the tunnel and no risk will then arise.  While this causes inconvenience and disruption to traffic, it is essential to maintain the safety standard required of such a fabulous piece of infrastructure.</P>
        <P>In line with all modern tunnels throughout the world, the Dublin Port tunnel requires regular maintenance and servicing of its equipment and systems.  Both Deputies will be aware that to facilitate such work, night-time closures are required at weekends on an ongoing basis.  Such closures take place between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. on Friday night and Saturday morning and on Saturday night and Sunday morning.</P>
        <P>Any additional special closures are separately announced whenever required.  Since the tunnel opened it has been available for use for approximately 98.5% of scheduled time.  In other words, non-scheduled closures arising from safety reasons have resulted in a reduction of tunnel availability of only 1.5%, which, by international standards is an excellent statistic.

      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a serious issue, namely, the sudden decision of the Department of Defence to evict residents of a block of family units in the Defence Forces married quarters at Cathal Brugha Barracks by means of a letter dated 11 September 2008, which demanded that the residences be vacated by 30 October 2008.  I call on the Minister for Defence to remedy this matter, as well as his failure to honour agreements entered into between the residents and the Department of Defence in the 1990s, whereby the units were to be sold to the residents.  Such agreements have not been honoured by the Department to date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The background is that the individuals involved are either former Army officers or family members of deceased Army officers.  While each household&rsquo;s personal circumstances differ, all have a common bond in that the father in each of the family units was a member of the Defence Forces of long standing, having served a full 21 years in the Army.  Their families have resided <Col N="956"/>in the aforementioned married quarters for more than 30 years.  No one can argue with the fact that these people have given the State some service and deserve to be recognised and treated with dignity and respect.</P>
        <P>On 19 September, the residents of each unit received correspondence from the Department ordering them to vacate their homes by 30 October.  The nature of this letter was extraordinarily cold and callous.  It stated that should the recipient fail to vacate, a court order would be issued and the Department would seek to recoup the costs and expenses incurred as it claimed it was entitled to do under the relevant Act.  This is no way to treat people who have served this country.  It constitutes shocking behaviour and it is completely unacceptable that it was allowed to happen.</P>
        <P>I stress this correspondence came out of the blue.  While there was ongoing communication during the 1990s regarding the purchase of these units from the Department of Defence, it was laid to rest at that time.  Nothing happened and the proposal was not pursued by the Department.  I have seen correspondence in the name of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, which was communicated in 2006 and which made no reference to eviction orders or notices or to the initiation of any such proceedings.  Suddenly however, a letter arrived telling people they must vacate the homes in which they have lived for the past 30 years within five or six weeks.  This is extraordinary.</P>
        <P>The position of the residents is clear.  They engaged in good faith with the Department and its representatives in the 1990s in an attempt to buy their homes from the Department.  This proposal was not pursued by the Department and it effectively was dropped.  While the residents have acted in good faith, I contend neither the Minister nor the Department has done so in the manner of their dealings with former Army officers and their families.</P>
        <P>A meeting took place in recent days between the residents and representatives of the Department of Defence at which certain obstacles were put forward by the latter in respect of the purchase of the units in question.  I stress the residents still are prepared to purchase the units, albeit at the rate offered to them in the 1990s because it was not their fault they ultimately were not allowed to purchase, as was agreed at the time between their solicitors and the Department.  They put no obstacles in the way and all such obstacles were laid down by the Department.  I contend that the price is non-negotiable in that the people involved must be allowed to follow through on the agreements that were put in place in the 1990s and which were reneged upon by the Department.  While there are issues in respect of various utilities such as water supplies and so on, these undoubtedly can be ironed out in terms of management structures within the complex.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although I am running out of time I wish to make a further point.  There was an intimation by the Department of Defence that there could be in some way a distinction between those units that are still occupied by former Army officers and those which, in effect, are occupied by Army officers&rsquo; widows.  I take grave exception to this suggestion, which suggests that the wives of Army officers should be disadvantaged because they have had the misfortune of losing a loved one.  This is a shocking way to distinguish between people whose families have been dedicated to the service of the State.  They must be treated with some decorum and respect.</P>
        <P>The bottom line is this has been exceptionally heavy-handed treatment which has caused significant anguish for those involved in that they were told they would effectively be thrown out on the street within a period of a just a few weeks, having lived in these units for the past 30 years.  I urge the Minister to put forward a satisfactory plan that would allow these people to have comfort and security for the future in terms of making their homes in these quarters of Cathal Brugha Barracks.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="957"/>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  I will speak from notes supplied by the Department of Defence.  Defence Forces married quarters are provided to serving members until their retirement or resignation and Defence Forces regulations state that quarters must be vacated within 15 days of leaving the service.  The current position has arisen as a result of a failure to vacate these quarters as required.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces married quarters at Cathal Brugha Barracks consist of three and four-bedroom maisonettes.  A letter issued to 11 occupiers who are in occupation on 11 September 2008, as the Deputy mentioned.  They were informed of the Department&rsquo;s intention to complete the process of obtaining vacant possession of these married quarters and the occupiers were requested to make arrangements to vacate the premises and make alternative arrangements for their accommodation as soon as possible, but no later than the end of October.  In the event that the occupiers qualified for local authority housing, an application form was enclosed.</P>
        <P>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s comments about the manner being callous and cold with regard to such matters, but it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any of those remarks.  From what I have heard, the letter was probably written by a legal person.  The Department of Defence indicates it should be clearly understood that the occupiers of these quarters are not being evicted as they have no entitlement to reside there and there are no tenancy agreements in place.</P>
        <P>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on people who have done the State service through the Defence Forces.  These issues often depend on what agreement was signed.  Although I do not have the full detail, I understand it is not today or yesterday that these people retired.  In many cases the issue might not concern widows but another generation.  If the Department has such rules, it is clearly becoming more efficient in implementing them as they seem to have been ignored for donkey&rsquo;s years.</P>
        <P>Previous attempts in the 1990s to sell the quarters to the occupants were not completed as legal difficulties were encountered.  No agreements were ever entered into to sell the quarters concerned to those people who are in occupation of them.  At a meeting with officials on 24 September, the occupiers were informed the deadline was not set in stone and the opportunity to work with them to achieve a solution favourable to all parties was welcomed.</P>
        <P>It would appear now, arising from yesterday&rsquo;s meeting, that all the occupiers wish to purchase the quarters.  Officials in the Department of Defence undertook to review the possibility of selling to the occupiers and a further meeting has been scheduled for the end of October.  It is hoped that substantial progress will have been made by that time to facilitate a solution that meets the needs of the both the occupiers and the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>When I served as Minister of State with responsibility for housing, there were a few old cases like this involving voluntary housing and apartments.  The argument was often thrown about that people were made an offer in 1988 or 1992 and the people wanted to buy at that price.  I do not believe I ever saw anybody succeed with that argument, although I understand it.  Matters seem to have moved forward in recent days from what the Deputy termed the original &ldquo;cold and callous&rdquo; letter.  I hope business can be done very quickly.</P>

      <sTitle>Water Quality.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I read with great alarm about the events which took place in the established residential area of Mervue.  The area is really divided in two, Old Mervue and New Mervue.  Old Mervue was built in the 1960s and before that there was Shantalla, built in the 1950s, Claddagh, which was built before then, and B&oacute;thar M&oacute;r, which is older again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The particular problem which arose in Mervue came about suddenly and without any warning to the residents.  To save time and deal with the issues in the case, I ask the Minister for <Col N="958"/>the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to clearly specify that if Galway City Council comes up with a response which involves resources, the Department will be willing to give such additional resources and enable the matter to be resolved quickly and with safety.</P>
        <P>A second issue that arises relates to discussions which took place between the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and officials in Galway City Council on a previous occasion when the council was suffering following the discovery of cryptosporidium.  On that occasion, was there any discussion on any other issues that might arise regarding drinking water quality?</P>
        <P>As an aside, I am deeply disappointed by the Minister&rsquo;s attitude towards a different issue, the source of the water supply in the Corrib.  He is insistent on leaving it with the local authority but I believe there should be a separate authority for managing water quality and the Corrib.</P>
        <P>On this specific issue, I have given the years of construction of the houses, most of which were bought under the tenant purchase scheme.  As they were built in the 1960s, they have an elderly population.  Effectively, at the end of July, Galway City Council notified the environmental enforcement section of the Environmental Protection Agency of a deterioration which was equivalent to four times the permitted level of lead content.  This was 106 micrograms per litre instead of the permitted 25 micrograms per litre.</P>
        <P>I welcome the enforcement section of the EPA because before it came about, many complaints one might make were dealt with somewhat rhetorically.  When the enforcement section of the Environmental Protection Agency was dealing with this issue, it was 25 August by the time a reply came from Galway City Council to documentation issued on 30 July.  The enforcement section of the EPA requested that the council prepare a programme for the replacement of pipework, consult with the Health Service Executive and identify the extent of the problem.  That was on 25 August.</P>
        <P>On 8 September, the city council responded by indicating that it was determining the extent of the required work and suggested that an agreed approach be forwarded to the EPA.  However, it became necessary on 24 September for the enforcement section to issue a direction to the city council to carry out a survey of all the areas involved, the necessary work and the lead testing carried out over the past four years.</P>
        <P>How much of that information has been supplied to the EPA?  There was also a request to identify an action programme.  It is important we get answers to the following questions.  Will the additional resources required to put this matter right be provided?  Has there been discussions between the two Departments on coming to the relief of an elderly population with the distribution of water, which is urgently required?  Will account be taken, for example, that if it is established the connecting pipe in Mervue is made of lead, and there is lead piping in houses in the older estates built before 1970, the Department will be in a position to respond to both circumstances?</P>
        <P>My next point is crucial.  Will officials from the Department be visiting the city council?  Perhaps the most important of my points is to ask why there is such a culture of not declaring a problem openly to the public when it arises.  Why was it necessary to have this long delay, which is dramatically revealed by the fact there was an ordinary city council meeting on Monday, 22 September with no mention of the problem?  Suddenly, it is revealed on 23 September and a special meeting is held on 24 September.  Why is it necessary to want not to declare these matters in public or move quickly to resolve them, thereby avoiding anxiety, particularly among elderly people?</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who regrets that he cannot be present.</P>
        <P>The Minister is very disappointed that this problem should be visited on the people of Galway who went through a very difficult summer in 2007 with cryptosporidium in their public water supply.  He is conscious of the difficulties and inconvenience suffered again by some residents.  It is a great worry for people and must be solved without delay.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s understanding is that the lead excess is likely to have been caused by lead leaching into drinking water from old lead water pipes serving certain limited areas of the city, mostly in older housing estates.  It is important to stress that the water leaving the treatment works does not contain lead.</P>
        <P>Galway City Council has confirmed that its priorities are to identify the areas affected by intensive lead sampling, introduce additional water treatment that would eliminate the leaching effect from old lead pipes and implement permanent pipe replacement measures, as required and as quickly as possible.  As a short-term temporary step, standpipes are being erected in the Old Mervue area to provide an alternative potable water supply.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It is important that water is distributed to old people because requiring people to go to a standpipe, of which it has been suggested there will be one per avenue, would be difficult.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past year, radically improved supervisory structures for water supplies have been put in place by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Local authority drinking water supplies are now subject to direct supervision by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The agency has been given extensive powers of direction and intervention for this purpose and the penalties for failure to comply with the new drinking water regulations have been substantially increased.  The EPA yesterday exercised its new powers of direction in this case.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the new regime introduced by the Minister is not alone to underpin compliance with water quality standards but to ensure consumers are adequately protected and properly informed.  I note the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on the delay in providing information and the culture of secrecy at work.  The Minister has in recent weeks announced details of a wide range of measures to guarantee high standards in our water supplies, including accelerated investment in key &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; schemes, improved operational practices and sharing of best practice among local authorities.  A key element of the Minister&rsquo;s initiative is improvement of consumer access to information on the quality of drinking water.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister will direct local authorities to publish on their websites up-to-date information on drinking water quality in their areas.  They will also be instructed to establish contact hot-lines so that members of the public can get the facts about the quality of their drinking water.  This ready access to information on water quality will empower consumers to actively engage with their local authority on the quality of their supplies.</P>
        <P>The response to the problem that has emerged in this case in Galway shows that the new system works and immediate local action is guaranteed when an incident occurs &mdash; all things are relative.  The EPA, as the body responsible for supervising local authorities&rsquo; management of their public water supplies, will oversee Galway City Council&rsquo;s response to the problem.</P>
        <P>The latest EPA drinking water report published in January 2008 reported 20 out of the 944 public supplies in the country had a sample with in excess of the standard for lead.  These are in all cases associated with lead service connections serving properties that are more than 40 to 50 years old.  Many more modern pipes are plastic.  The EPA has for several years alerted <Col N="960"/>local authorities to the issue.  Appropriate pH correction at the water treatment plant ensures water will not react with lead pipes.  The dosing of phosphates is also recommended by the EPA as a means of reducing lead in the water as it has the further effect of sealing the lead within the network.  This can be done easily and quickly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Substantial funding is being provided towards Galway city&rsquo;s water conservation programme and it is open to the city council to prioritise any pipe replacement that would take the offending lead services permanently out of commission.  This may provide a solution to the Deputy&rsquo;s request that extra funding be provided.  Considerable funding has been allocated to Galway City Council for its water system.  It is a matter for the council to prioritise how this funding is spent.  In the meantime, it is important that all possible resources are focused on getting the problem solved quickly and effectively.  The Minister is confident that with continuing close co-operation between the council, the EPA and the HSE, lead levels in the water supply can be reduced and then phased out.</P>
        <P>I will convey to the Minister the Deputy&rsquo;s question concerning lead in households.  I doubt the Deputy&rsquo;s request can be acceded to as local authorities are usually responsible for external piping up as far as the walls of households or stopcocks located on footpaths.  Piping from the stopcock to household sinks is usually the responsibility of the householder unless he or she is a local authority tenant.  However, I do not wish to announce policy, favourable or otherwise, on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  If officials are in good humour, the Deputy&rsquo;s hopes may be realised.  I will convey to the Minister the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on the need to assist elderly people.  I am sure the area has a strong community and people will assist older members of the community who may not be able to walk to standpipes.</P>

	<P>In the Budget for 2008, my predecessor announced an efficiency review that required all Departments to review the scope for savings in a wide range of areas including the scope for the rationalisation of State Agencies.  This was taken further last July, when I specifically asked for a further review of all State Agencies to examine whether they can share services, whether it would be appropriate to absorb some of their functions back into their parent Departments or whether some agencies should be amalgamated or abolished.  </P>
        <P>My Department is examining the bodies under its aegis and it is also working with all other Government Departments on this matter and issues, including the human resources issues mentioned by the Deputy, arising from this are being considered in the context of the Budget.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 15 and 26 together.</P>
        <P>In their discussion of Member States&rsquo; response to the current economic slowdown at the recent informal Ecofin meeting and in so far as budgetary policy is concerned, Ministers noted the supportive role of the Stability and Growth Pact, its emphasis on reducing deficits and the importance of compliance with the Pact.   The question of a possible breach by Ireland of the 3% of GDP deficit limit was not discussed at the informal Ecofin.  I did, however, take the opportunity at the Eurogroup meeting to provide my colleagues with a general update of the position in Ireland.  I also had an informal meeting with Commissioner Almunia on the margins of the informal Ecofin, during which I provided him with a general update on the position in Ireland.   He confirmed that the Commission would, as is the norm, assess the position after it receives the fiscal notification that Ireland, like all other Member States, will be submitting to Eurostat at the end of September.</P>
        <P>As regards measures related to the Stability and Growth Pact, Ireland&rsquo;s stability programme update which will include projections for the general government balance for 2009 to 2011 will be published with the Budget on October 14th.  The update is due to be examined by the Economic and Financial Committee of Ecofin (the EFC) in late January 2009.  The stability programme is among those on which the Ecofin Council is expected to adopt a Council Opinion at its February 2009 meeting.</P>
        <P>As regards the operation of the excessive deficit procedure, the position is that in accordance with Article 104 of the EU Treaty the Commission prepares a report if a Member State exceeds the 3% deficit limit or if the Commission is of the opinion that there is a risk of an excesssive deficit .     This procedure, the timing of which is a matter for the Commission authorities, normally leads to a Council recommendation designed to encourage the Member State concerned to take steps to correct the deficit.      The Pact provides that where special circumstances exist in the economic and budgetary position this may be taken into account in setting the initial deadline for correction of an excessive deficit.</P>

In this update an economic and fiscal assessment was presented based on the information to hand at end June. On the 3rd of September the Government announced that it was bringing forward Budget 2009 to the 14th of October 2008. Furthermore my Department will hold the usual quarterly press conference for the end-September Exchequer Returns, which will, as normal, set out the emerging trends in the public finances. On Budget Day I will set out my macro-economic and fiscal framework for the next three years. As Budget Day is only a few weeks away the necessity for the Pre-Budget Outlook is no longer there this year.</P>

	<P>In early July my Department published a technical economic update which set out forecasts for 2008, based on the latest information available at that time. On this basis, unemployment was expected to average 5.8% or in numbers terms some 132,000 during 2008. This compares to unemployment of 4.5% or 101,000 in 2007. </P>
        <P>My Department last published inflation forecasts on July 2nd as part of the Technical Update of Current Year Macroeconomic Forecast.  This set out its expectation that CPI inflation would average 4.3 per cent for 2008. Since then the ECB announced a quarter percentage point increase in interest rates. Factoring this in would imply a CPI inflation rate of 4.5 per cent for 2008 as a whole. Updated inflation forecasts for the period out to 2011 will be published as part of Budget 2009.</P>
        <P>At the end of this month, as is usual, my Department will make its six monthly return to Eurostat setting out the overall fiscal position, including the General Government Balance for the years up to 2007 and my Department&rsquo;s forecast for 2008. This forecast will take account of the latest fiscal information available at that time.</P>
        <P>In announcing the bringing forward of Budget 2009, I stated that my Department&rsquo;s latest assessment indicated a tax shortfall significantly in excess of that previously expected for 2008. September is a key month for tax revenue and while we do not have full month data yet, early indications suggest that the poor performance in tax receipts witnessed over the summer months is continuing. My Department is closely monitoring overall tax performance in the run-up to the Budget.</P>
        <P>My Department will publish an updated view on expected tax and Exchequer positions at the end of this quarter. A comprehensive assessment of the fiscal and economic position will be contained in the Budget which will be published on 14 October 2008. As is normal, I will not comment on the contents of the Budget in advance of that date.</P>

	<P>Towards 2016 is a ten year framework agreement which sets out an agenda for the further modernisation of the public service.  It commits the parties to the Agreement to continued co-operation with change and modernisation initiatives, as well as improved productivity across the public service.  </P>
        <P>In approaching the recent Partnership talks the Government recognised that while significant progress has been made in advancing the modernisation agenda, many more changes are both awaited and needed.  In particular, there must be a more customer-focussed approach to the delivery of public services, with an increased focus on service delivery over internal reforms and a shift in emphasis from organisational inputs to outputs and outcomes for the citizen. I want the modernisation process to deliver results that are clear, useful and verifiable to the user and puts the public at the centre of our public services.</P>
        <P>The parties to the agreement support the development of a more customer-focussed approach to the delivery of public services and acknowledge that there are challenges that must be addressed if the public service is to meet the needs and expectations of our citizens.  The agreement recognises that the public service must review continuously its systems, processes and procedures, to ensure that it is responsive and efficient and that it provides high quality, value for money services.  There will be a need for changes in skill mix; in how services are delivered; when and where they are delivered; and by whom they are delivered.  Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Towards 2016, the parties acknowledge the requirement for developing the range of service delivery options, for utilising shared services in areas such as HR, ICT and financial management and for developing cross-organisational solutions as a way of addressing problems of service delivery on a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; basis.</P>
        <P>In approaching the talks the Government was also mindful of the recommendations of the OECD Review of the Public Service, Towards an Integrated Public Service, which concluded that we are on a sound trajectory of modernisation but could further improve the yield from reforms by renewing focus on their pace and sequencing in order to make them more mutually reinforcing.  The Government has established a Task Force to develop a new Action Plan for the public service of the 21st Century in the light of the recent comprehensive Review by the OECD.  Its report is expected shortly.</P>
        <P>While the detailed implementation of the Action Plan will require discussions with all relevant interests, the parties to the agreement commit themselves to implementation of the basic principles emerging from the OECD report.  In particular, they accept the need identified by the OECD to give more emphasis to the public service as an integrated system with a greater focus on meeting the needs of citizens.  This will require that people within the different elements of the public service system work in a more consistent, co-ordinated, networked way across the traditional sectoral and organisational boundaries.  It also means that Departments, Offices, and Agencies will have to interact with each other in new ways to ensure integrated action in policy-making, delivery and implementation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 60 and 87 together.</P>
        <P>As I announced on 20 September 2008, the Government has decided to increase the statutory limit for the Deposit Guarantee Scheme for banks and building societies from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 per depositor per institution.  The cover will apply to 100% of each individual&rsquo;s aggregate deposits up to the prescribed limit per banking institution.  This guarantee level will also apply to credit union savers.  Branches of foreign institutions authorised in the European Economic Area (EEA) and operating in Ireland are entitled to benefit from the enhanced guarantee.  My Department is currently preparing legislation to give statutory effect to this increase from the date of my announcement.  The level of protection available for deposits in Irish financial institutions is now amongst the highest in the European Union.</P>
        <P>The Government remains confident in the strength and resilience of the Irish financial system and is committed to maintaining its ongoing stability.  Notwithstanding this, I believe that now is an appropriate time to underline this commitment by enhancing the level of protection available to depositors so as to ensure all deposits in Irish financial institutions are safe.</P>
        <P>The increased protection now available to Irish depositors is without prejudice to possible enhancements to the EU Deposit Guarantee Directive.  A review of the Directive was mandated by the ECOFIN Council meeting in October 2007 and Ireland is actively participating in this review.  Consideration is being given to the level of savings guarantee as well as wider policy areas such as improving the speed of payouts, depositor information and cross-border interoperability.  Any further changes required in the Irish Deposit Guarantee Scheme will be implemented to ensure that savers in Ireland benefit from safeguards in line with EU best practice.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s system of financial regulation is based largely on a comprehensive and detailed EU template and conforms to international best-practice standards.  The role of the Minister for Finance as regards financial regulation is to develop policy and bring forward proposals to the Oireachtas for the regulation of the financial services sector.  Once that legislation has been enacted, the task of implementing and applying it on a day-to-day basis rests with the Financial Regulator, which is independent of the Minister in the exercise of its statutory functions.</P>
        <P>Ireland operates a regulatory framework for banks based on the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), a framework which is applied commonly across Europe.  In addition, the Financial Regulator in Ireland has imposed additional requirements on banks, requirements which have proven prudent in the light of recent events.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that, as events have unfolded in the financial sector over recent months, the EU has taken the initiative to review elements of its regulatory framework including in relation to the prudential framework for banks set out in the CRD.  Ireland has taken a full part in the debate at EU level and as events unfold we will continue to do so.  We will be to the forefront in the implementation of any appropriate changes to the regulatory framework.</P><Col N="966"/>
        <P>The Deputy refers in particular to derivatives and futures. In its 2007 Strategic Plan, the Financial Regulator identified the need to build up resources and capacity in the supervision of securities markets as an important area of work.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that in transposing the Market in Financial Instruments Directive into Irish law in 2007, unlike some countries, we took up the option available in the Directive of imposing reporting requirements on derivative transactions based on shares.  It is fair to say that events have shown this to have been a prudent choice on our part.  It provides an important flow of information to the Financial Regulator on what is happening in the market.</P>
        <P>I welcome, in particular, the fact that on the 18th September 2008, the Financial Regulator moved quickly to ban the short selling of bank shares in the wake of a similar SEC decision in the U.S.  I understand that the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s rule covers positions taken via derivatives as well as the direct short selling of those shares.  The rule sets out that any transactions or arrangements designed to benefit from a fall in the price of those shares, however engineered, is banned by the rule. Thus any use of derivative instruments is covered.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, Ireland&rsquo;s general view and approach is that transactions involving share-based derivatives should be treated, in so far as practical, in the same way as transactions directly in those shares.  We will continue to refine and develop the regulatory framework to ensure this is the case.	</P>

	<P>A person is regarded as resident in the State for tax purposes in a tax year if he or she spends: (a) 183 days in the State in that year, or (b) 280 days in aggregate in that tax year and the preceding tax year. </P>
        <P>An individual who is present in the State for 30 days or less in a tax year will not be treated as resident for that year unless he or she elects to be resident.  Also, a day will only count if the individual is present in the State at the end of the day.</P>
        <P>However, even if an Irish domiciled person establishes non-residence he or she remains liable to Irish tax on income arising in Ireland (e.g. income from directorships, a trade or profession, rented properties etc.).  The only income which escapes Irish tax for individuals in this category is income arising elsewhere in the world outside Ireland.</P>
        <P>As regards capital gains, Irish domiciled non-resident individuals remain liable to Irish capital gains tax on disposals of land, buildings or shares deriving their value from these assets and certain other assets such as minerals in the State or other assets related to exploitation of such minerals.  They are not liable to Irish capital gains tax on assets outside this category e.g. shares or equities in companies not deriving their value primarily from land, buildings etc.</P>
        <P>The tax residency rules were last updated in the 1994 Finance Act.  These rules are similar to the rules that apply in many other developed countries and they are constantly kept under review.</P>

        <Quest> his view on the proposal that, as part of an anti-inflationary package, user fees and charges for public services should be frozen or reduced in 2009 in order to lessen the cost of living pressures on those with low and average incomes. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the perception that government charges are significantly increasing the rate of inflation. In this regard, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that the pickup in inflation in recent years has been driven primarily by external developments, namely the global rise in oil and food prices and increases in interest rates. </P>
        <P>Government administered charges, excluding independent regulators, account for around one twentieth of the total weighting of the basket of goods and services which make up the Consumer Price Index. As such, the contribution of increases in these charges to total inflation is small.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this fact, I would like to reassure the Deputy that the Government is committed to achieving a moderate rate of inflation. In light of this, when developing public policy &mdash; be it at Budget time or during the year &mdash; due consideration is given to any potential inflationary impacts.</P>
        <P>I would also point out that inflation is expected to ease next year as some of the factors that impacted on inflation earlier this year wane. Inflation forecasts out to 2011 will be provided on Budget Day.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that on 20 September 2008 the Government increased the statutory limit for the deposit guarantee scheme for banks and building societies from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 per depositor and extended the scheme to include credit union savers.  It is intended that in the case of credit union savers the deposit protection scheme will act as a backstop to an approved savings protection scheme.</P>
        <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) has since 1989, operated a savings protection scheme (SPS) for credit unions which has, to date, operated by providing financial support to credit unions that get into difficulty.  It has never been necessary to make savings protection payments to individual credit union members.  Under the SPS regime no credit union has become insolvent and no member of a credit union has experienced any loss of shares or deposits.  The Registrar of Credit Unions in the Financial Regulator is working closely with ILCU to approve a reform to SPS.  It is expected that these discussions will conclude shortly.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the stability of our whole financial system and the enhanced deposit protection scheme will provide additional reassurance to savers that their savings are safe.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In his 2005 Budget Statement, my predecessor announced that a review of a broad range of tax incentive schemes would be undertaken in 2005.  The review process included studies by external consultants Indecon and Goodbody Economic Consultants, as well as internal reviews by officials from the Department of Finance and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, with the involvement of other Government Departments as appropriate.  In the Budget 2006 documentation, summaries of the recommendations of the various reviews were published, and the full reviews were published by my Department in three volumes on the 6th of February 2006.  The general findings and recommendations arising from the review of tax schemes were taken into account and will continue to be taken into account where appropriate in the context of the ongoing formulation of tax policy.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2006, in line with the recommendations of the consultants my predecessor  announced the termination, subject to certain transitional provisions, of the following reliefs; the urban renewal, town renewal and rural renewal schemes, reliefs for holiday cottages, student accommodation, multi-storey car parks, third-level educational buildings, sports injuries clinics, developments associated with park and ride facilities, the general rental refurbishment scheme and the special accelerated reliefs for hotels and holiday camps.</P>
        <P>In line with the recommendations of the consultants, the tax reliefs available for private hospitals, registered nursing homes and child care facilities were retained.  In addition, in Finance Act 2006 the clawback period for investors was increased from 7 to 15 years for these 3 reliefs.  In the case of all new schemes introduced since the completion of the reviews in 2005 and for private hospitals that are first used on or after 1 February 2007 provision was made in the relevant legislation to provide for the full disclosure of key information to the Exchequer by investors promoters to enable the full cost and impact of the schemes to be monitored.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2006 the introduction of a limit, with effect from 1 January 2007, on the use of tax reliefs, including certain exemptions, by high-income individuals was announced.  Section 17 of Finance Act 2006 gave effect to this announcement.  This measure was designed to address the situation where a small number of individuals with high incomes had been able to reduce their income tax liability to a very low level or to zero by means of the cumulative use of various tax incentive reliefs.  Such individuals are no longer able to do so.  This provision ensures that such individuals who use tax incentive schemes will have an effective rate of income tax for each year of not less than about 20 per cent on the income sheltered by such schemes.</P>
        <P>The reviews also proposed that any new reliefs should be time limited and should, where relevant, be subject to an assessment of costs and benefits prior to their introduction.  I will continue to follow this advice as far as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The role that time-limited tax relief schemes can play in supporting public policy objectives is routinely assessed as part of the ongoing process of tax policy formulation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 54 and 64 together.</P>
        <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) was established in 2001 under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000.  The purpose in establishing the NPRF was to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until at least 2055.  The Act requires the Government to make a contribution of 1% of GNP to the NPRF each year.</P>
        <P>The Act also provided for the establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to control and manage the Fund.  The Commission has discretionary authority to determine the Fund&rsquo;s investment strategy in accordance with the Fund&rsquo;s statutory investment policy of securing the optimal total financial return provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission.  The Commission&rsquo;s investment strategy is based on the expectation that equities or real assets will outperform financial assets over the long term despite swings over short term periods.</P>
        <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund earned an investment return of 3.3% in 2007 bringing its annualised return from its inception in April 2001 to end 2007 to 6.0%.  It showed a return of -12.0% for the first six months of 2008, reducing its annualised return since inception to 3.8%.</P>
        <P>I am aware and I accept that the appropriate investment strategy for a long-term fund can lead to short-term volatility, particularly in difficult market conditions such as we have experienced over the last year.  Indeed the Fund previously experienced a negative return of -16.1% in the bear market of 2002 before recovering strongly over the following five years.  In its 2007 Annual Report, the Commission states that, in seeking to meet the Fund&rsquo;s objective, it has adopted an investment strategy primarily focused on building up a diversified portfolio of equities and other real assets.  Such an asset allocation offers the prospect of superior long-term return but can expose the Fund to high levels of short-term volatility.  However, one of the critical factors underlying the Commission&rsquo;s investment strategy is the Fund&rsquo;s long-term investment horizon.  With no drawdowns before 2025, it can afford to accept periods of volatility as a trade-off for achieving a long-term return that will make a meaningful contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s future pension costs and the sustainability of the pension system.</P>
        <P>As regards the statutory contribution, Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me, in the run-up to Budget Day on 14 October, to discuss or speculate on any of the Government&rsquo;s expenditure provisions for the coming year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the deductions and reliefs which are allowable for tax at an individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of income tax and for which estimates of cost can be provided are set out below together with estimated costs for the year 2005, the most recent year for which the necessary detailed information is available except where otherwise stated.  If relief for these deductions and reliefs was confined to the standard rate of income tax the saving to the Exchequer could be of the order of &euro;1,000 million.  This estimate does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such a change or the economic effect of such a change.  This applies in particular to the BES, Film Relief and Capital Allowances regime.  The standard rating of employee pension reliefs would also have an impact on workers&rsquo; take home pay.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 56, 63 and 70 together.</P>
        <P>Maintenance of the overall stability of the Irish financial system is a central priority of Government.  Since August 2007 the international financial system has been affected by unprecedented turmoil and dislocation.  Credit markets which are pivotal to meeting the medium-term funding needs of the financial system have effectively closed since August 2007.  Inter-bank lending rates for shorter maturities have increased very significantly increasing the cost of finance to financial institutions.  Difficulties created by impairments of sub-prime securities have adversely impacted on the European and particularly US financial systems as demonstrated by recent developments in the US.  This has led to major uncertainty for the global financial system.</P>
        <P>The prompt actions by international central banks, including the European Central Bank, to provide major injections of liquidity have contributed to greater stability in financial markets internationally, though they continue to remain subject to significant uncertainties.  Agreement on the extensive and far-reaching plans announced recently by the US authorities should help to stabilise financial markets and rebuild confidence in the international financial system.</P>
        <P>Ireland as a small, highly open economy with a significant financial sector closely integrated in the international financial system cannot be immune from these developments.  The Government has, therefore, been very active in supporting public confidence in the safety of deposits and the stability of the financial system overall.  I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s support for my announcement on 20 September last that the Government had decided to increase the statutory limit for the deposit guarantee scheme for banks and building societies from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 per depositor per institution and that the cover will apply to 100% of each individual&rsquo;s deposit up to the &euro;100,000 limit.  This guarantee level, which will also apply to credit union savers, is now among the highest in the EU.  The Government is committed to the stability of our financial system, so that money placed with an Irish credit institution would not be at risk.  The Irish Government wants to protect the whole financial system and secure its stability.</P><Col N="972"/>
        <P>It is of course a responsibility of the Board and management of a financial institution to ensure that it lends prudently.  The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s licensing and supervision standards require banks to have in place appropriate policies relating to the management and control of lending.  Irish banks have virtually no exposure to sub-prime securities.  There are no proposals before Government for a guarantee or liquidity extension package.  As far as meetings with the banks, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator are concerned, such meetings are a normal part of my role as Minister for Finance given my responsibilities for the financial sector.</P>

        <P>Although the Deputy does not specify what threats to the Irish corporate tax regime he has in mind, he may be referring to the European Commission&rsquo;s technical work on a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB).</P>
        <P>It is important to note that there has been no political decision taken on the CCCTB at the level of the Council of Ministers and the Commission has not brought forward a proposal to Council.

	<P>Budget documentation is published each year and updates on the Exchequer finances are published monthly by my Department.  The economic assumptions which underpin the Budget are based on the best information available at Budget time.  The Budget book also contains a comparison of the Department&rsquo;s main macro-economic forecasts with those of other key institutions.</P>
        <P>As regards performance budgeting, Ireland has made significant progress in this area over recent years with a view to moving beyond the traditional narrow focus on financial inputs, in favour of accountability for what is being achieved and delivered with public moneys.  In this regard, the introduction of Annual Output Statements in 2007 represents a major step forward.  The Output Statements set out the key public service targets that are to be delivered over the year ahead, and they are considered by the relevant D&aacute;il Select Committee as part of their consideration of the annual Estimate allocations.  From this year, the Output Statements also include an account of progress in achieving the output targets for the previous year.  The comprehensive Value-for-Money (VFM) framework that has been put in place over recent years, including evaluations of programmes of expenditure under the Value for Money and Policy Review initiative and the establishment of a dedicated Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit in the Department of Finance to promote best practice in this area, also reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that performance and delivery are integral to Ireland&rsquo;s budgeting and accountability infrastructure.</P>
        <P>In its recent review of the Irish public service, Towards an Integrated Public Service, the OECD commented favourably on Ireland&rsquo;s progress to date in developing and implementing a performance-focused agenda, and it put forward a number of recommendations for further improvement.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that arrangements for identifying and tackling aggressive tax avoidance schemes differ across States. A common thread running through many of these arrangements is the need for tax authorities to know, as early as possible, the details of schemes that may need to be challenged (under existing anti-avoidance legislation) or closed down by legislation. Consideration was given as to how best to address this information need in the context of the 2006 Finance Act, having regard to approaches in other jurisdictions. It was considered that a voluntary reporting approach, coupled with a built-in incentive to disclose, best suited our particular requirements and would avoid many of the problems associated with obligatory regimes.  On that basis, Finance Act 2006 introduced the &ldquo;protective notification&rdquo; regime, which was further strengthened in Finance Act 2008.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the protective notification regime is to encourage taxpayers and their advisers to be open with Revenue in relation to transactions that may be tax avoidance <Col N="975"/>transactions within the meaning of the general anti-avoidance provision (section 811 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997).  Under the regime taxpayers who do not make a protective notification face, among other things, a 20% surcharge on the amount of tax that they sought to avoid where the Appeal Commissioners and ultimately the Courts uphold a Revenue challenge that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction. By way of a positive incentive for the taxpayer to make a protective notification, the time period within which the Revenue Commissioners must challenge a transaction under section 811, which was previously open-ended, is limited, where a full protective notification is made, to a period of two years from the date of the notification.</P>
        <P>The enhanced protective notification regime is already having an impact with 55 new protective notifications received by the Revenue Commissioners since the enactment of this year&rsquo;s Finance Act. While many of these notifications relate to the same avoidance schemes it is apparent that taxpayers and their advisers are taking the provisions of the protective notification scheme seriously and availing of the opportunity to disclose their tax planning arrangements to the Revenue Commissioners. The operation of the protective notification scheme will, however, be kept under review, taking account also of the experiences of other jurisdictions with obligatory disclosure schemes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under VAT law Member States must apply a standard rate of VAT and may opt to also apply one or two reduced rates of VAT to certain goods and services listed in Annex III of the EU VAT Directive. In addition, where a Member State applied a zero rate or reduced rate to specific goods or services on 1 January 1991, they may retain that system, although no new items may be added. Ireland basically operates three rates of VAT; a zero rate, a standard rate of 21%, and a reduced rate of 13.5%. I should point out that the standard VAT rate, as its title indicates, is meant to be the normal VAT rate to be applied to goods and services. Variations from the standard rate are meant to be exceptions. Compared to other Member States Ireland, as outlined below, has widely used such exceptions to apply a zero rate or reduced rate of VAT to a wide range of goods and services.</P>
        <P>The majority of foods in Ireland are currently charged at the zero rate of VAT, as are children&rsquo;s clothes and shoes, books and oral medicines, as these items were zero-rated on 1 January 1991. Under normal EU rules such goods would be chargeable at the reduced rate of 13.5%, with the exception of children&rsquo;s clothes and shoes, which would be chargeable at 21%. In relation to the reduced rate, in Ireland, fuel used for heat or light are chargeable to VAT at the reduced VAT rate of 13.5%, being only one of eight EU Member States to do so. The provision of residential housing is also chargeable at this rate. In recent years children&rsquo;s car safety seats were added to the list of reduce-rated goods. In terms of services, many labour intensive services are subject to the reduced rate of VAT. These include general repair and maintenance services e.g. car repairs, repair of electrical appliances and services consisting of the care of the human body e.g. hairdressing. In addition, the reduced rate applies to waste acceptance and disposal services and veterinary services and agricultural services. In this regard, it should be noted that in Ireland, zero and reduced rated goods and services amount to 46% of all goods and services liable to VAT, which is high relative to most other Member States.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy knows, Budget 2009 will be presented to the D&aacute;il on Tuesday, 14 October. Decisions in relation to Budget 2009 are currently being formulated for consideration by Government in advance of Budget day. It is not clear as to the overall level of government borrowing that may be required at this stage. This depends on a number of variables. Beyond that, as the Deputy knows, it is not the usual <Col N="978"/>practice to speculate in advance of the annual Budget on what it will contain and I do not propose to deviate from this practice now.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In June 2006 the Government approved 92 formal Value for Money and Policy Reviews to be carried out for the period 2006-2008. This programme of reviews focuses on significant areas of expenditure and major policy issues. To date 43 reviews have been completed. 27 within the current round are overdue for completion. As of end-June 2008, eight reviews had yet to commence and one is not proceeding with the agreement of the Value for Money and Policy Review Central Steering Committee. The table below sets out the position as reported for the end quarter monitoring exercise carried out by my Department at end-June 2008, which has been updated to show reviews completed in the interim. Details of reviews by the Department including those completed and the original scheduled completion dates of remaining reviews are set out in the table.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for carrying out each of the reviews, publishing them and submitting them to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the relevant D&aacute;il Select Committees rests with the individual Departments and Offices and details in respect of any individual review should be sought from the relevant Minister. In respect of the reviews under my own Department and the Offices for which I have responsibility the following is the position:</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 75 together.</P>
        <P>Following a decision by the Government on the implementation of recommendations in Report No. 38 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, schemes of performance-related awards were introduced for the levels of Deputy Secretary and Assistant Secretary in the civil service, the Deputy Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner ranks in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the ranks of Brigadier General and Major General in the Defence Forces. The schemes of awards are based on performance by reference to demanding targets. The pool for performance awards is 10% of the pay bill for the group concerned. Within that overall limit individuals can receive payments of up to 20% of pay (although payments at that level would be very rare)</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have no role in the decisions on awards. Decisions on awards are made by the Committee for Performance Awards (CPA), which includes a majority of private sector members. The main roles of the Committee are to monitor the application of the scheme of performance-related awards and to bring independent judgement to bear in approving objectives for the persons covered by the scheme and in approving recommendations for awards. Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the schemes, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the Committee available on the website www.finance.gov.ie. The annual reports provide a commentary on how the schemes have operated each year and the CPA make suggestions about how aspects of the scheme can be improved. The performance related pay schemes are monitored by an independent body &ndash; the CPA &ndash; and I am satisfied that the CPA is fulfilling its remit in relation to the schemes.</P>
        <P>There are separate schemes of performance-related awards for senior staff of local authorities and the health service. The Committee for Performance Awards in the Local Authority sector deals with the assessment of performance for senior managers in local authorities. For senior managers in the health service, the board of the HSE/relevant agency makes awards based on the agreed criteria. The scheme is quality assured by an Oversight Committee which is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children.  Schemes of performance-related pay may also apply to the Chief Executive Officers of non-commercial State sponsored bodies (and in some cases, to the second tier of management). The Review Body considered that certain conditions should be in place non-commercial State-sponsored bodies before schemes of performance-related awards were introduced for the CEOs of those bodies. Where these conditions are met, the Board of the body concerned can submit a scheme to the parent Department and, subsequently, my Department for approval. These schemes are also based on the achievement of stretched targets and provide for a maximum bonus of 20% of pay. The guidelines provide that awards of between 15% and 20% should arise only in the most exceptional situations where performance has surpassed all reasonable expectations and has resulted in the achievement of a major goal of the body. Decisions on the level of payment to be awarded are the responsibility of the Board of the body concerned. I have no plans at present to introduce schemes of performance-related awards for other public service staff.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the basis on which he plans to forecast the tax receipts in the last quarter of 2008 for which he will have no hard evidence by the date of Budget 2009. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In formulating the Budget every year it is necessary for my Department to make an estimate on the expected outturn for the current year in advance of the receipt of all revenues for that year. As the Budget is traditionally held on the first Wednesday in December, it is normally only tax receipts for the month of December that must be estimated. Obviously this year it will be necessary to make an estimate of the outturn that covers a longer period of time than is the norm. My Department, in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, will make this assessment taking into consideration the emerging trends in receipts over the course of the first nine months of the year, as well as any relevant accordant economic data, such as retail sales figures, employment figures, motor sales figures etc. Based on the latest information available at that time, an end-year outturn will be forecast. However, what I will not do today is speculate further on this in advance of having all of the relevant data fully analysed.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 74 together.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Finance, my role as regards financial regulation is to develop policy and bring forward proposals to the Oireachtas for the supervision of the financial services sector, including that based on EU financial services law. Once that legislation has been enacted, the task of implementing and applying regulatory requirements on a day-to-day basis rests with the Financial Regulator, which is independent of me in the exercise of its statutory functions. The Deputy will be aware that the Financial Regulator has a statutory mandate to safeguard the interests of consumers of financial services.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the reports referred to in the Deputies&rsquo; questions relating to offers of interest-free loans to potential house purchasers. There are, however, many variations to these types of schemes and in the absence of precise details of their terms and conditions, it is not possible to make an assessment of possible regulatory and, indeed, taxation implications. My Department, has, however, asked the Consumer Director in the Financial Regulator to review current practices of seller financing of deposits for housing sales and I will advise the Deputies of the outcome of this assessment. In relation to taxation implications of any particular scheme, full details should be sent to the Revenue Commissioners, to enable them to form a view on the matter.</P>

        <P>I understand that the Commissioners of Public Works had agreed terms with Cork County Council, to purchase a site in Youghal, comprising 3 acres approximately, to accommodate new decentralised offices for the Public Appointment Commission and the Valuation Office.  A number of title and other issues arose in relation to the Contract for Sale and these were in the process of being resolved by Solicitors for both parties prior to completion of the Contract.</P>
        <P>However, the Government decided on 8 July last that further expenditure on the acquisition of accommodation for decentralisation would be paused pending the review by Government of reports from the Decentralisation Implementation Group ( DIG) and the Implementation Group of Secretaries General.  Until the outcome of the review is available, no further expenditure on the acquisition of decentralisation sites will be undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works, except in cases where a legally binding contract exists.</P>
        <P>Under the decentralisation programme both the Public Appointments Service and the Valuation Office are required to transfer one hundred (100) posts each to Youghal.  I understand that there are currently twelve (12) staff in the Public Appointments Service and fifteen (15) staff in the Valuation Office assigned for decentralisation who are awaiting a move to Youghal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 65 together.</P>
        <P>Discussions are in train with the trustees/administrators of the funded pension schemes of the five older universities and certain non-commercial semi-State bodies (SSBs), which have funded pension schemes, with a view to providing consistency and clarity for the future in terms of meeting the liabilities of the schemes.</P>
        <P>This follows consideration some time ago of the pension difficulties facing those universities by a working group under the Higher Education Authority, which recommended such discussions. The background to this is that all funded schemes must now meet minimum funding standards under EU law unless they are covered by the State. This has presented problems for the universities and non-commercial SSBs with funded pension schemes where the State ultimately carries the liability but where this is not clear enough to warrant exemption under EU <Col N="990"/>law. In that context, and provided all the schemes concerned agree, it is proposed that the assets of those schemes would be transferred to the State along with the liabilities which would then be met, effectively, by the State on a pay as you go basis in the future. The terms and conditions of the schemes would be no better nor worse than the members would be entitled to anyway. If agreement is reached, legislation to give effect to all this would be required.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the estimated value of the assets of all of the funds in question at end-2007 was in the region of 2.3 billion euro, but this will have changed in the interim and is subject to market fluctuations.  The liabilities in relation to these schemes are the defined benefits to which the members are entitled and for which the State is already, effectively, responsible.  Under the proposal, these will be met by the State on a pay as you go basis, in line with the approach taken in relation to public service pensions generally.</P>
        <P>As regards the impact on the public finances, under current Eurostat rules, the transfer of the assets would impact positively on the General Government Balance (GGB) when received.  This initial revenue would be offset in the future by the payment of pension benefits which would be recorded as Government expenditure at the time of payment. The effect on the GGB when the assets are received is clearly identified as being once off in the National accounts and the underlying GGB is, therefore, still unaffected.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that voluntary organisations must register for tax if they carry out taxable activities or encounter taxing events. An example would be a voluntary organisation which employs persons under the PAYE/PRSI system or carries on a trade.  Such an organisation would have an obligation to register and account for PAYE/PRSI, and VAT, if their turnover exceeds, or is expected to exceed, the appropriate registration limit.  In order to register for tax, a voluntary organisation must complete a tax registration form (available on Revenue&rsquo;s website) and forward it to their local District Tax Office. </P><Col N="991"/>
        <P>Some voluntary organisations, such as charities and sports bodies, may be entitled to tax exemptions, subject to certain conditions. The charitable tax exemption is available to bodies which have been established for charitable purposes only, under Section 207 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. In order to avail of the exemption, the relevant organisation must have a legal structure and a Governing Instrument and it must satisfy Revenue that it has been established for charitable purposes only and that it will apply its income for charitable purposes only.</P>
        <P>Full details in relation to the application process for charities (including the application form itself) are contained in information booklet CHY1, Applying for Relief from Tax on the Income and Property of Charities, which is available on the Revenue website or by phoning Lo call 1890 666 333.</P>
        <P>A separate tax exemption is provided for sports organisations under Section 235 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.   Under this provision, a tax-exempted sports body can be exempted from certain taxes, provided it applies its income to the sole purpose of promoting an athletic or amateur game or sport. Full details in relation to the application process for sports bodies (including the application form itself) are contained in Leaflet GS1, Relief from Income Tax and Corporation Tax for Certain Sporting Bodies&rdquo;. This is also available on the Revenue website.</P>

	<P>As I have previously indicated, economic growth for this year is now likely to be significantly less than that forecast at Budget time.</P>
        <P>At the end of August, taxes were nearly EUR2.8 billion behind target. My Department is closely monitoring overall tax performance in the run-up to the Budget. The weakness in taxes, particularly on VAT, CGT and Stamp Duty receipts, reflect a number of factors namely, the substantial adjustment in the housing market, the ongoing difficulties in the international financial markets and slower domestic economic activity such as weaker retail sales. Ireland is not unique in facing these difficulties and many of our euro area partners are experiencing similar forces acting upon their public finances.</P>
        <P>As is normal, I will not comment on the contents of the Budget in advance of that date. Budget 2009 will, however, set out a comprehensive approach to ensuring that Ireland remains on course for sustainable economic and social development over the medium term.</P>

      </Qst><Col N="992"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The VAT treatment of goods and services is governed by EU law with which Irish law must comply.  One of the basic tenets of EU VAT law relates to the proper functioning of the internal market. This means that it is not possible to use VAT law to favour artists not resident in this state over artists that are resident in the state.  In addition, Article 283 of the EU VAT Directive precludes the granting of a threshold to non-resident taxable persons and consequently it is not possible to apply the Irish VAT exemption threshold to non-resident artists.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to change the current VAT treatment of foreign artists who supply services in the State.  Introducing an exemption for non-resident performers would immediately create a distortion of competition between resident and non-resident performers. It is likely that the introduction of such an arrangement would not only be challenged by resident performers but also possibly by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>It has to be recognised that Ireland provides an exemption from VAT for the promotion and admission to live musical and theatrical performances.  This very broad exemption is allowed under Article 132 of the EU VAT Directive. In effect, this means that the promoter realises the full value of admission fee as no VAT is applied to admission fees. In this regard, the current exemption is already very generous in covering a broad range of activities accessible to the wider public.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to small self-administered pension schemes.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that such schemes are a particular type of occupational pension scheme in respect of which special Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; requirements already apply as regards their approval for tax relief purposes, operation and supervision.  The reason for the extra rules is to ensure that such schemes are established in a bona fide manner to provide retirement benefits and not for tax avoidance purposes.  As regards their possible use in tax avoidance, a concern arises due to the <Col N="993"/>fact that they are typically single member schemes with the member generally being a proprietary director.  There is potential for a conflict of interest as the individual involved is normally the owner of the business, a trustee of the scheme and the scheme member.  I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners, that in light of this, they require all such schemes to appoint an experienced professional trustee, known as a &ldquo;pensioner trustee&rdquo; to act in a watchdog capacity and to ensure the scheme complies with the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; approval requirements.  In addition, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are restrictions on the investment options available to such schemes.</P>
        <P>Most occupational pension scheme rules, small self-administered or otherwise, provide for the event of early retirement.  The Revenue Commissioners permit scheme rules which allow individuals to retire and commence benefits at anytime after the individual&rsquo;s 50th birthday.  Early retirement may be either voluntary, enforced or due to ill health.  The option to retire early will be subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme.  It typically requires the consent of the employer or the scheme trustee.  If early retirement is chosen, benefit restrictions apply.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners require an individual to cease service to commence benefits &mdash; he or she must cease to be an employee of the relevant employer.  In the case of a 20% director, all links with the business must be severed, including the disposal of his or her shareholding in the company.  Apart from an entitlement to take a tax-free lump sum which varies, depending on the circumstances of the individual scheme member, from one and a half times final remuneration to 25% of the value of the fund subject to an upper limit, all pension benefits are subject to taxation.  This applies whether they are taken as pensions, annuities or distributions from approved retirement funds.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is aware that my predecessor addressed the issue of excessive tax relieved pension benefits being built up in pension schemes in the 2006 Budget and Finance Act.  This followed recommendations made in the Review of Tax Relief for Pension Provision carried out jointly by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005.  Concerns in that regard had centred around the view that tax relief for pensions was skewed towards highly paid executives and those who own companies, on the basis that such individuals appear to have the capacity to have significant pension contributions made on their behalf by their employers into pension vehicles such as small self-administered pension schemes.  As a result of the review, a number of significant changes were made to the pensions tax code.  These included closing off excessive tax relieved funding for pensions through the imposition of a maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes of &euro;5 million, with punitive tax on amounts drawn down in pension benefits in excess of that sum; imposing a cumulative limit of 25% of this amount &mdash; &euro;1.25 million &mdash; on the maximum tax-free lump sum that can be taken on retirement; and restricting the capacity of individuals to use Approved Retirement Funds as purely long-term tax-exempt vehicles by introducing the concept of an annual &ldquo;notional distribution&rdquo; from such funds which is taxable at the fund owner&rsquo;s marginal tax rate.</P>

	<P>EU Finance Ministers have adopted an extensive roadmap of actions incorporating a work programme aimed at putting in place a comprehensive response to developments in financial markets.  This programme includes reviewing along with the EU&rsquo;s international partners how to further improve transparency of complex financial instruments, valuation standards, the prudential framework, risk management and supervision and market functioning including the role of ratings agencies.  Ireland is participating fully in this work at EU level to ensure there is an effective EU-wide system to maintain financial stability, taking into account the important cross-border linkages that now exist in EU financial markets.</P>

	<P>In view of the changing global economic environment and the slowing domestic construction sector, the prospects for employment have weakened during 2008.  Based on the latest information available at the end of June, my Department published a mid-year technical economic update.  At that stage, unemployment was forecast to average 5.8% for the year as a whole.  Since then, later data has been published and the standardised unemployment rate for August was 6.1%.  My Department is updating its economic and fiscal forecasts for the upcoming budget on October 14.  Labour market forecasts, including forecasts of those unemployed for 2009 and 2010 will be reviewed in this context.  My Department will publish its three-year macroeconomic prospects at that stage.</P>

	<P>Decisions to relocate companies or elements of their supply chain are a reality of the modern globalised economic environment.  Companies adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues and accessing technology in addition to business takeovers and consolidations.  Such decisions inevitably result in flows of investment and employment across borders.  In the main, Ireland successfully manages this process through its policies on enterprise and foreign direct investment.  These policies, <Col N="995"/>such as competitive tax rates, investment in skills, education and research and development and investing in critical physical and communications infrastructure, have positioned us to win many prestigious and high value added investments and enabled us to replace lost jobs with others of equal or higher value in the economy.</P>
        <P>Ireland is no longer a low cost economy.  Therefore, we must seek to develop economic competencies higher up the value chain.  In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions and promote new areas of competitive advantage.  The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, remains one of the highest in the world.  While competition from emerging markets for FDI has intensified, Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.  The pipeline of new business for which IDA Ireland is competing is strong.  Already this year 28 new IDA investments have been announced with the potential to create 2,100 jobs over the coming years, demonstrating that we remain a location of choice for mobile investment.</P>
        <P>Irish companies also benefit substantially from globalisation as new markets and business opportunities open up.  While off-shoring can contribute to job losses for firms in some sectors, productivity gains achieved through off-shoring some activities represents an opportunity to develop higher-end manufacturing and related activities domestically.  The model of manufacturing in developed countries is changing and Irish enterprises are adapting to those changes and engaging in higher value added activities in order to compete in the global marketplace.  This has been achieved as a result of increased productivity, technology levels and the sophisticated skills of Irish employees.</P>
        <P>To sustain and grow the manufacturing sector, Irish based manufacturing enterprises will have to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation.  Innovation and the productivity gains that flow from it are the new foundations for competitiveness.  The recently launched report of the high level manufacturing group contains some 26 recommendations directed at key areas of innovation and productivity leading to transformational change, reskilling and management development which will ensure Irish manufacturers can continue to compete successfully on international markets and provide high value sustainable employment.</P>
        <P>We continue to be one of the world&rsquo;s leading service exporting countries and are currently ranked the 10th highest exporter of services in the world.  Earlier this month, I launched the report of the Services Strategy Group, Catching the Wave:  A Services Strategy for Ireland.  This report sets out new policy proposals on how we can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland&rsquo;s services sector and outlines how to maximise the future returns to the country from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential.  The implementation of these recommendations will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as e-learning, business and financial services and professional and consultancy services.  The Government is fully committed to strengthening the competitiveness and productive capacity of the economy.  Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability, that are technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy.</P>

	<P>Community employment is an active labour market programme designed to give eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged people, including those with a disability, an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed-term basis.  The qualifying criteria for participation are intended to facilitate the movement of participants through community employment, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity to avail of the programme.  Qualified adult dependents of people in receipt of a disability-linked social welfare payment are ineligible for community employment under the eligibility criteria.  However, a person in receipt of widow&rsquo;s contributory pension is eligible to participate if he or she has been in receipt of the payment for 12 months or more.</P>

	<P>Under the decentralisation programme, my Department is due to decentralise 250 posts to Carlow.  Since 30 July 2007, 100 posts have been decentralised to an advance office in the town.  For the period between 3 July and 22 September 2008, I can confirm that no moneys have been expended, no properties have been purchased and no staff have been decentralised by my Department under the decentralisation programme.  The five agencies under the aegis of my Department that are due to decentralise under the decentralisation programme are Enterprise Ireland, which is moving to Shannon; the Health and Safety Authority, which is moving to Thomastown; the National Standards Authority of Ireland, which is moving to Arklow, F&Aacute;S, which is moving to Birr; and the National Consumer Agency, which is moving to Cork.</P>
        <P>All the staff of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority have been based in the authority&rsquo;s offices in Naas since January 2006.  Therefore, the authority is fully decentralised.  In advance of decentralising to Thomastown, the HSA has established an interim office in Kilkenny city.  It has confirmed that two staff decentralised to the interim office between 3 July and 22 September 2008.  Some 27 HSA staff are located there.  The HSA also confirmed that, under the decentralisation programme, no moneys have been expended and no properties have been purchased for the period in question.  The other four agencies &mdash; Enterprise Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, F&Aacute;S and the National Consumer Agency &mdash; have confirmed that, under the decentralisation programme, no moneys have been expended, no properties have been purchased and no staff have been decentralised by them, for the period from 3 July to 22 September 2008.</P>

	<P>When F&Aacute;S completed its annual review of the jobs club programme in early 2008, I understand that it raised concerns about the capacity of Carrick-on-Suir jobs club to meet the agreed targets.  Representatives of the club were advised by F&Aacute;S that funding would be discontinued if no progress was made towards achieving the targets.  F&Aacute;S has since indicated that there is insufficient evidence of progress in meeting the targets.  It has asked the directors of the jobs club and other interested parties to convene meetings with community interests in Carrick-on-Suir to determine what alternative programmes would attract potential participants and address the needs of unemployed people in Carrick-on-Suir.  F&Aacute;S expects to be able to discuss such proposals with the board of the jobs club before the end of September.  F&Aacute;S is supporting a wide range of other programmes such as a local employment service, community employment projects and contracted training in Carrick-on-Suir, to the value of over &euro;1 million.  It is committed to funding and supporting agreed programmes in Carrick-on-Suir.</P>

	<P>The Industrial Development agencies continue to promote North Tipperary for investment and job creation.  The strategy that has been adopted involves a transition to the knowledge economy aimed at winning new foreign direct investment in innovation driven, high value and high skill sectors.  On the indigenous front, the focus is on the creation of new high potential start up companies.  One of the key elements for success is having quality business facilities available.  Shannon Development and IDA Ireland continue to work on the provision of suitable property solutions for potential investors.  The development of Tipperary Technology Park is an integral part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s international marketing programme.  Shannon Development also has Business Parks in Roscrea and Nenagh and sites are being developed in Templemore and Archerstown, Thurles.  The Thurles Marketing Group is continuing with its marketing initiative which is part of the County&rsquo;s Economic and Cultural Strategy up to 2012.  The focus of the marketing initiative is to promote Thurles as a location for business investment, not only for foreign direct investment, but also for indigenous investment.  I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the Industrial Development agencies in conjunction with local interests will continue to be successful in attracting investment and jobs to North Tipperary.  The agencies will, of course, continue to work with their existing clients in this regard as well.</P>

	<P>Employment and unemployment are measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey and published by the Central Statistics Office.  As it is devised on a regional basis, it does not provide a breakdown for specific areas such as north Tipperary.  The most recent Quarterly National Household Survey, for Quarter 2 of 2008, March to May, indicates that employment in the mid-west region, which includes north Tipperary, has decreased by 500 and unemployment has increased by 1,400 people since Quarter 1, December 2007 to February 2008.  The Live Register provides monthly data for specific areas including north Tipperary, but it is not <Col N="998"/>designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.  The number of people signing on the Live Register in north Tipperary increased by 1,294 for the first eight months of 2008.  This trend is in keeping with what is happening in other regions/areas in the country.</P>

	<P>An application was received in respect of the person in question on the 23 January 2008.  This application was refused on the grounds that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits for highly skilled, highly paid positions or to non-EEA nationals already legally resident in the State on existing valid employment permits.  Furthermore the position on offer was one of the occupational categories currently ineligible for an employment permit.  The applicant was notified of this decision in writing by letter dated 7 February 2008 and of his or her right to appeal within 21 days.  No appeal was received in the Employment Permits Section within this timeframe so the fees in this case were refunded to the applicant. <Col N="1000"/> In such circumstances, it is not possible to revisit the application.  However, if the person wishes to submit a new application in respect of an eligible occupation, it will be considered on its merits.</P>

	<P>The National Flood Policy, which was adopted in 2004, requires that flood relief works carried out by the Office of Public Works be concentrated on areas where the likelihood and impact of flooding in terms of personal and economic damage is greatest, with particular emphasis on dwellings at risk. OPW&rsquo;s resources are fully committed to such priority schemes at present. The OPW is not in a position therefore, to contribute to the protection of the community facilities in Geevagh.</P>

	<P>In Ireland the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland integrates within a single institutional structure both the supervision of individual financial firms by the Financial Regulator and the monitoring of overall <Col N="1001"/>financial stability, which is the independent responsibility of the Governor of the Central Bank. It is important to emphasise that the framework for financial regulation here is shaped by a detailed and comprehensive template which applies across the EU.</P>
        <P>EU Finance Ministers have adopted an extensive roadmap of actions incorporating a work programme aimed at putting in place a comprehensive response to developments in financial markets. This roadmap includes reviewing along with the EU&rsquo;s international partners how to further improve transparency of complex financial instruments, valuation standards, the prudential framework, risk management and supervision and market functioning including the role of ratings agencies. Earlier this year ECOFIN Ministers and Central Bank Governors agreed an extended Memorandum of Understanding on financial stability contingency planning between financial supervisors, central banks and finance ministries that incorporates common principles and practical guidelines for cross-border cooperation. This EU framework facilitates timely information exchange and sharing of views and assessments between my Department and the CBFSAI on issues related to financial stability.</P>

        <Quest> if changes are proposed to enhance the monitoring of the economy by the Central Bank or his Department with a view to earlier identification of economic trends and the putting in place of corrective measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31770/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department continually monitors the emerging economic position and advises accordingly. But the Deputy will note that economic forecasting is not an exact science and this time last year the vast majority of commentators were not expecting the scale of the slowdown we are currently experiencing. In fact the forecasts produced at Budget time last December were seen as being conservative and below the consensus view that pertained at that time. In terms of its monitoring role, in July of this year my Department published revised economic forecasts in order to inform both the public and policy makers regarding the scale of the slowdown.</P>
        <P>In terms of corrective measures, in early July the Government decided on a number of measures in order to manage public spending so that emerging pressures could be best accommodated within the planned expenditure level for 2008, while laying the basis for a sensible budgetary strategy for 2009. Furthermore, earlier this month the Government decided to bring forward the Budget for 2009 to October 14th. This reflects the necessary prioritisation of expenditures in light of expected tax revenues and will give clarity and confidence to investors and taxpayers alike and provide a sound basis for economic recovery.</P>
        <P>Finally, I would like to remind Deputy that the determination of operational matters in the Central Bank is solely a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. However it is fair to say that the Central Bank like other organisations produce regular economic forecasts and commentaries.</P>

        <P>House price inflation was well ahead of the general level of inflation in the economy during the period in question. However, the latest data shows that prices fell 9.9 per cent in the twelve months to August 2008 and that they are around 13 per cent below their peak levels.</P>
        <P>The Government has in the past implemented measures to bring stability to the housing market, such as the measures my predecessor took in the last Budget regarding stamp duty and mortgage interest relief. I do not propose to say what I may or may not do in my forthcoming Budget.  I have set out in Table 1 the level of house price inflation and the average house price in each of the last ten years. The remaining Tables give details of relevant tax receipts over the same period.</P>

	<P>The swift actions by international central banks, including the European Central Bank, to provide major injections of liquidity have contributed to greater stability in financial markets internationally, though they continue to remain subject to significant uncertainties.  Agreement on the extensive and far-reaching plans announced recently by the US authorities should help to stabilise financial markets and rebuild confidence in the international financial system.</P>
        <P>Ireland as a small, highly open economy with a significant financial sector closely integrated in the international financial system cannot be immune from these developments.  The Government has, therefore, been very active in supporting public confidence in the safety of deposits and the stability of the financial system overall.  The Government has decided to increase the statutory limit for the deposit guarantee scheme for banks and building societies from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 per depositor per institution and that the cover will apply to 100% of each individual&rsquo;s deposit up to the &euro;100,000 limit. This guarantee level, which will also apply to credit union savers, is now among the highest in the EU.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the stability of our financial system, so that money placed with an Irish credit institution would not be at risk. The Irish Government wants to protect the whole financial system and secure its stability.  In terms of measures to promote economic stability, I would highlight the decisive action taken by the Government to underpin confidence throughout the wider economy by bringing forward the Budget.  The Government also helped <Col N="1004"/>secure a draft National Pay Agreement which will help promote stability, certainty and industrial peace.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 105, 107 and 109 together.</P>
        <P>Maintenance works on the River Arra at Newcastle West, involving the removal of vegetation to improve water flow, were carried out by the Office of Public Works subsequent to the recent serious flood event. Similar works had been carried out in 2006. Dredging work was not carried out in recent years as it was not deemed necessary due to the relatively steep gradient of the channel.</P>
        <P>Limerick County Council did not seek a contribution from OPW towards the cost of the consultants&rsquo; report that was commissioned by the Council in relation to the recent flood event. OPW staff provided technical input to the consultants in the preparation of the report.</P>
        <P>OPW engineering staff have begun a detailed analysis of the causes of the flooding with a view to identifying potential mitigation measures. The OPW have reviewed the consultants&rsquo; report and will take relevant findings into account in their analysis. Any issues in relation to riverbank development would be a matter for Limerick County Council.  If options are identified that are economically and environmentally acceptable they will be included in OPW&rsquo;s flood relief programme, subject to other commitments and the availability of resources.  The aim of such measures would be to provide the level of protection normally afforded by urban flood relief schemes i.e. protection against flood events that would be expected to have a 1% chance of occurring each year.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs is providing assistance where appropriate to victims of the recent flooding, through the Community Welfare Officer network.</P>

An on-going programme of maintenance and improvement works is being carried-out to the range of historic buildings in the Park, including Doneraile House (Court) and adjoining coach-house, walled gardens and associated structures. These works include improved general landscape maintenance, new sewerage connection for and upgrading of public toilets, repairs to main entrance gate, internal roads and bridges, health and safety and security works.</P>
        <P>The Main House has been secured and weather-proofed but opening to the public might require further substantial works.

        <Quest> his views on whether the proposals contained in the Programme for Government to cut income tax rates will undermine the State&rsquo;s ability to fund essential public services in view of recent economic developments which demonstrate the dangers inherent in an over-reliance on taxes related to construction and consumption. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would remind the Deputy that the Programme for Government is a five year programme, which must be judged over the full five years of this Government, taking account of the health of the public finances. Budget 2008 was the first instalment of the delivery of that programme.  However, it is clear that we have now entered a period of lower economic growth than was generally envisaged in the early part of last year. As such, this process must be managed carefully so as not to jeopardise our longer term future and this is what the Government is doing.</P>
        <P>In terms of the weakness in tax revenue, it is fair to say that over the summer months the pace of the contraction has picked up considerably. At the end of August, taxes were nearly EUR2.8 billion behind target. My Department is closely monitoring overall tax performance in the run-up to the Budget. The weakness in taxes, particularly on VAT, CGT and Stamp Duty receipts, reflect a number of factors namely, the substantial adjustment in the housing market, the ongoing difficulties in the international financial markets and slower domestic economic activity such as weaker retail sales. Ireland is not unique in facing these difficulties and many of our euro area partners are experiencing similar forces acting upon their public finances.</P>
        <P>My Department will publish an updated view on expected tax and Exchequer positions at the end of this quarter. A comprehensive assessment of the fiscal and economic position will be contained in the Budget which will be published on 14 October 2008. As is normal, I will not comment on the contents of the Budget in advance of that date. Budget 2009 will, however, set out a comprehensive approach to ensuring that Ireland remains on course for sustainable economic and social development over the medium term.</P>

	<P>Section 130 of the Finance Act 1992 defines the various categories of motor vehicle. Three main categories of vehicle are relevant to this <Col N="1007"/>query: Category A, cars and minibuses with less than 12 seats; Category B, certain car-derived vans and jeep-derived vans; Category C, certain commercial vehicles, agricultural tractors and minibuses with at least 12 permanently fitted passenger seats.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware Category A vehicles are charged VRT at rates ranging from 14% to 36% of their Open Market Selling Price (OMSP) based on the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions of the car.  All category B vehicles are charged VRT at a standard rate of 13.3% of OMSP. Vehicles falling within category C are liable to a flat rate registration charge of &euro;50.</P>
        <P>The rates for categories B and C vehicles are, as a matter of policy, set at lower levels than for vehicles in category A as the main purpose of such vehicles generally involves either carrying goods, or carrying passengers as a commercial transport venture.  As category B vehicles combine a passenger-carrying profile along with a high goods-carrying capacity and are therefore frequently acquired as category A substitutes, they are not afforded the lowest rate of VRT. Category C vehicles, on the other hand, are very rarely acquired as a substitute for a category A vehicle; and for this reason, such vehicles are afforded a lower rate than category B vehicles.</P>

        <P>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and Vehicle Registration Tax (up to a certain limit), and exemption from motor tax, on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities.</P>
        <P>The disability criteria for these concessions are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of these Regulations.  Some 12,500 people benefited under the scheme in 2007 at an overall estimated cost of &euro;74 million.  Any changes would have to be considered in the context of the annual Budget.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, inflation in Ireland is measured using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For EU comparisons, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is used. Both measures are comprehensive measures of inflation at the economy level and are widely recognised as such.  The main difference between <Col N="1008"/>the two is the exclusion of mortgage interest from the HICP.  My Department uses both measures to monitor inflation developments on an ongoing basis. </P>
        <P>Achieving a moderate rate of inflation is a key economic policy priority given its importance in helping to restore national competitiveness. In recognition of this, the Government has and continues to take positive action to control inflation. Such action includes implementing responsible fiscal policies, promoting competition and increased price transparency through the work of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, along with considerable investment in public infrastructure under successive National Development Plans.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Government continues to work with the Social Partners to ensure that externally-driven price increases do not become embedded in our system as that only creates a vicious cycle from which no one wins. In this respect, the willingness of the various parties to compromise and adopt a realistic approach to wage developments in the recent pay talks is commendable.</P>

	<P>Office of Public Works staff respond as far as possible to all reports they receive of damage to private or public property and business as a result of flooding. Many of these requests do not generate formal reports as the position is outlined to interested parties in the course of discussions on the problem, and where OPW has a responsibility for maintenance of channels, necessary works are incorporated in ongoing maintenance programmes. Where OPW does not have a responsibility, this is explained and any other useful information is provided in an informal manner.</P>
        <P>It would require a major investment of time to search through diaries and records to list all of the locations assessed in this manner and the outcome in each case. The cost and diversion of staff from their normal duties to do this would not be justified.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will recall that my Department&rsquo;s latest inflation forecasts were published on July 2nd as part of the Technical Update of Current Year Macroeconomic Forecasts. These set out its expectation that CPI inflation would average 4.3 per cent for 2008 as a whole. Since then the ECB announced a quarter percentage point increase in interest rates. Factoring this in would imply a CPI inflation rate of 4.5 per cent for 2008.</P>
        <P>In the year to date, CPI inflation has averaged 4.6 per cent. However, like other commentators, my Department expects to see an easing in the average rate of inflation in the latter part of this year and into next. There are a number of reasons why the rate of inflation should decelerate going forward. These include a moderation in commodity prices, the pass-through of the strong euro and the slowdown in the economy. Technical factors such as favourable base effects will also contribute to an easing of inflation.</P>
        <P>My Department will publish updated inflation forecasts as part of Budget 2009.</P>
        <P>Achieving a moderate rate of inflation is a key economic policy priority given its importance in helping to restore national competitiveness. In recognition of this, the Government is taking positive action to control inflation. Over the short to medium-term this includes implementing responsible fiscal policies and promoting competition and increased price transparency through the work of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.</P>
        <P>We are also continuing to prioritise investment in physical capital under the National Development Plan. Over the longer term, this will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services, which by improving the economy&rsquo;s efficiency should help to keep inflation in check.</P>
        <P>Finally, from a competitiveness perspective, I would stress the importance of ensuring that externally-driven price increases do not become embedded in our system as that only creates a vicious cycle from which no one wins. In this respect, the willingness of the various parties to compromise and adopt a realistic approach to wage developments in the recent pay talks is commendable.</P>

Accordingly, I do not believe it would be appropriate for me to speculate on ECB interest rate movements in 2009 or their impact on the cost of mortgage interest relief for next year.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost of mortgage interest relief in 2008 is expected to be approximately &euro;665 million.</P>

        <P>Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services. In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services. The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised my Department that as of 19th September 38,859 claim forms have been received under the Health Repayment Scheme. It is estimated that following adjustments for rejections and duplicate claims, the number of valid claims will be approximately 19,300.  17,684 claimants have received an offer of repayment and it is anticipated that the remaining offers will be processed by the end of November 2008.  However it should be noted that the repayments offered in November cannot be paid until the statutory 28 day period has elapsed.</P>
        <P>In addition claimants who receive offers in November must be given the opportunity to appeal the decision.  The Appeals Officers must investigate each appeal independently, these <Col N="1014"/>investigations can require additional reviews by the Health Service Executive and the Scheme Administrator and certain appeals present a high level of complexity.  This may influence the finalisation of the Health Repayment Scheme.</P>

	<P>Based on the National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services, and the fact that the BreastCheck screening programme will significantly reduce the number of symptomatic breast cancer presentations, the Health Service Executive (HSE) determined that we require a total of eight specialist breast cancer centres nationally.  It is important to clarify that this is not a downgrading of services but rather a consolidation of cancer care in designated centres which has the potential to improve survival by up to 20%. </P>
        <P>In order to comply with the Standards, the HSE has directed seventeen hospitals to cease breast cancer services.  Further staged reductions in the number of hospitals providing breast cancer services, including Sligo General, will occur over the next year in line with the development of quality assured capacity in the eight designated centres.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;7 million has been allocated in 2008 from the Programme across the eight centres for symptomatic breast disease services, to support additional staff, including Consultant, Radiography, Nursing and clerical posts.  Funding has also been allocated for some necessary additional equipment.</P>
        <P>The Director of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme is engaged in detailed planning to facilitate the transfer of services between locations.  The Director will ensure sufficient capacity exists in designated centres prior to the transfer of services. The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate. Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment, other than surgery, can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo.  Chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.</P>
        <P>In relation to the provision of services in Northern Ireland, I welcomed Minister McGimpsey&rsquo;s announcement last April, on the provision of a satellite radiotherapy centre (linked to Belfast City Hospital) to be located in Altnagelvin.  It will provide the additional radiotherapy capacity needed to meet an anticipated increase in cancer in Northern Ireland and recognises the potential for cross border co-operation in the development of this resource.  Officials from my Department and the Department of Health, Social Services &amp; Public Safety are involved in ongoing discussions in this regard.</P>
        <P>Cancer patients in the North West requiring radiation oncology treatment are referred to either St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin or University College Hospital Galway.  A Service Level Agreement is also in place for the referral of radiation oncology patients from Donegal to Belfast City Hospital.</P>

	<P>Budget 2008 provided &euro;110 million for the implementation of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal.  My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, and I are conscious of the effect that the unavoidable and unforeseen delays in implementing Fair Deal are causing to some older people and their families.  To date, &euro;13 million has been allocated from the additional monies provided in Budget 2008 for the provision of 200 contract beds.  Approval has also been given to the HSE to utilise a further &euro;12 million in meeting costs associated with nursing home subventions and existing contract beds.</P>
        <P>This brings to &euro;25 million the total funding redirected from the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and committed to nursing home supports in 2008.

        <P>Both the Minister and I are fully committed to introducing the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme in 2009.  The Minister expects to bring the Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate in this D&aacute;il session.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 140 together. </P>
        <P>I am aware of emerging concerns of the United States authorities regarding intercountry adoptions between the United States and Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Officials from my Office and the Adoption Board have been monitoring the situation and liaising closely with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassy in Hanoi since these concerns emerged over recent months.</P>
        <P>Adoptions between Socialist Republic of Vietnam and Ireland are regulated by a State to State agreement entitled the Agreement on Mutual Cooperation Concerning Adoption between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and Ireland.  Under the Agreement, it is a matter <Col N="1021"/>for the Vietnamese Authorities to determine that each child is legally available for adoption and for the Adoption Board to determine whether Irish applicants are eligible and suitable to adopt.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Office has been working to finalise a new Bill which will ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-Operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  As part of the preparations for the likely passage and entry into force of the new legislative arrangements for adoption in Ireland, my Office has been advising the Department of Foreign Affairs on the potential implications of the legislation on existing arrangements and agreements for those countries which have not yet ratified the Hague Convention.  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is one of those countries.  These discussions, involving the Adoption Board and the Department of Foreign Affairs, include consideration of the re-negotiation of the existing Agreement with Vietnam to ensure it reaches the standards required under the new Bill.  I hope to be in a position to open discussions shortly with Vietnam on a revised or new agreement, subject of course to the views and advice of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  All of the matters referred to by the Deputy will be raised as part of those discussions.  I would like to assure the Deputy of my attention to this issue.</P>

	<P>There has been a growing demand for, and investment in, physiotherapy in the health services over the last number of years.  There were a number of issues contributing to difficulties accessing physiotherapy services, one of which had been the supply of qualified personnel available to fill vacant posts.  A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates.  In this regard, the number of training places for physiotherapy has been increased from 64 to 145, which represents an increase of 127% since 1997. </P>
        <P>The number of physiotherapists employed in the public service has grown from 593 whole time equivalents in 1997 to 1433 in 2008.

The Government continues to support the development of new physiotherapy posts, particularly in the areas of Disability and Primary Care.  My Department is working closely with the HSE, and representatives of the professions, with a view to ensuring that the optimum number of such posts are filled as expeditiously as possible, having due regard to the requirement on the HSE to operate within its budget.</P>

	<P>The RPA continues to make good progress in the PPP tender process for Metro North. The initial phase of the PPP public procurement process was conducted in 2007 resulting in the formation of four pre-qualified consortia for the purpose of tendering for the project.  Tender documentation was formally issued to the four pre-qualified consortia on 12th May 2008.  Since then the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) <Col N="1025"/>has held a number of meetings with the consortia.   Following on from a request from some of the consortia, the RPA recently agreed to extend the closing date for submission of tenders by two months.  Receipt of tenders is now required by 6 February 2009.</P>
        <P>In addition, good progress is being made in the planning process.  The RPA placed copies of the Railway Order application on display on 17 September in accordance with the 6 week statutory public notice requirement pursuant to section 37 of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001.</P>
        <P>In January 2008, the Government approved the funding structure for the Metro North PPP, including an Exchequer provision for advance works ahead of the main PPP contract and a capital contribution during construction.  In accordance with the requirements of the Government decision on the Transport 21 Investment Framework, Metro North will be submitted to Government for a final decision on the project on the completion of the tender process.   I am not in a position to give any information in relation to the budget for Metro North project in advance of the completion of the public procurement process.  The publication of such commercially sensitive information prior to the completion of the competitive procurement process would prejudice the State&rsquo;s capacity to derive maximum value for money in respect of the project.  The target date for the completion of the project is 2013.  However, this will be critically determined by the outcome of both the planning and procurement processes.</P>

	<P>The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) is responsible for safety regulation of the civil aviation industry in Ireland, including the regulation of helicopters.  The IAA has informed me that helicopter owners and pilots must operate their helicopters in accordance with S.I. No. 61 of 2006, Irish Aviation Authority (Operations) Order, 2006 and S.I. No. 72 of 2004, Irish Aviation Authority (Rules of the Air) Order, 2004. Safety of the public and criteria for landing sites is prescribed for in the aforementioned Orders.</P>
        <P>Regarding the regulations and requirements for helicopter operations operating to/from an open space in the proximity of a densely populated residential area, the IAA has informed me that the following requirements are in place.  Article 5 (d) and (e) of Statutory Instrument S.I. <Col N="1026"/>No 334 of 2000 (Aerodromes and Visual Ground Aids) Order states that an aircraft shall not take-off or land at any place in the State save at &mdash; In the case of a rotorcraft any place where the aircraft may take-off or land without undue hazard to persons or property and in respect of which the owner or occupier shall have given permission. Rule 2 of Statutory Instrument S.I. No 72 of 2004 (Rules of the Air) Order, states that &ldquo;An aircraft shall not be operated in a negligent or reckless manner so as to endanger life or property&rdquo;. Aeronautical Notice NR O.41 &lsquo;Operation of Helicopters at unprepared sites&rsquo; reinforces the regulations set out in both S.I. 72 of 2004 and S.I. 334 of 2000 while at the same time gives additional guidance on procedures to be followed at ad-hoc landing sites.</P>
        <P>The pilot of a helicopter is the responsible person with regard to public safety while landing at a site and the landowner&rsquo;s permission must be sought for landing. The IAA informed me that regulatory requirements are under constant review by the Authority and where necessary are amended to ensure that safety is not compromised.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the Coroner inquiry process is a matter for the relevant Coroner, who is independent in the exercise of that quasi-judicial role.  In certain cases a post-mortem will be required so as to enable the Coroner to carry out his/her statutory functions and a range of factors can influence the time it takes for the post mortem report to be received from the pathologist concerned.  I understand from the Cork Coroner&rsquo;s office that in their experience it generally takes between 3 and 6 months for a post-mortem report to be received but that this may take longer where further specialist tests are required (e.g. toxicology, histology and microbiology tests).</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>First of all it is important to set out the legal provisions that govern entry to the State of foreign nationals.  Every person landing in the State, including the holder of a visa, is obliged, pursuant to the provisions of section 11 (2) of the Immigration Act, 2004, to furnish to an immigration officer such information in such manner as an immigration officer may reasonably require for the purposes of the performance of his or her functions.  The fact that a visa is a permission to present at the frontiers of the State but does not guarantee entry to the State was confirmed by the High Court as recently as 23rd May 2008 (Emmanuel Omatayo James &amp; Others &mdash; V &mdash; Minister for Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform). At section 4 of the Immigration Act, 2004, provision is made for an immigration officer to authorise a non-national to land in the State.  However sub-sections (3) of section 4 enumerates, at (a) to (k) fourteen circumstances in which an immigration officer, may, on behalf of the Minister, refuse to give a person a permission to land in the State.  The circumstances, any one of which may give rise to a permission to land being refused, include, the fact that there is reason to believe that the non-national intends to enter the State for purposes other than those expressed by the non-national.  In performing his or her functions under the Immigration Act, 2004, an immigration officer is obliged, pursuant to the provisions of the Act, to have regard to all the circumstances of the non-national concerned known to the officer or represented to the officer by him or her.</P>
        <P>The Garda National Immigration Bureau dealt with the case of the person who is the subject of this Parliamentary Question in accordance with these provisions. In this instance, I am advised that the applicant claimed he was visiting a named person he identified first as his brother and then as a cousin &mdash; when, in fact, they are not related. This fact was established when telephone contact was made with the named person. This was a significant factor in the Immigration Officer&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>As regards the committal of the person concerned to Cloverhill Prison on 9 September I am informed that he was processed through Reception in line with standard practice.  He would not have been in the line of sight of anyone other than prison officers searching him. He was also treated as all other committals in accordance with Irish Prison Rules. Such searching is entirely appropriate and necessary to ensure the security and safety of the prison and the health and safety of the individual concerned.  In line with Standard Operational Procedures, the individual was seen on Landing D1 on the morning of 10 September as a new committal.  I also understand that the records indicate that the Rules and Regulations were explained to him and a phone card application was issued.  No complaints were recorded.  The person concerned also received two visitors while in Cloverhill Prison and was discharged to the custody of the Garda National Immigration Bureau on the evening of 10 September 2008.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the individual was very distressed by these events.  However, I am satisfied that both the Immigration and Prison authorities fully complied with all the necessary <Col N="1035"/>legal and administrative procedures in their handling of this case.  I am also satisfied that the individual was treated with courtesy and respect at all times.</P>
        <P>Finally, may I add by way of general comment that many individuals attempt to enter the State illegally by circumventing normal immigration procedures through deception or misrepresentation. In this regard it may be of interest to note that there was a case at Dublin Airport last July in which a person purporting  to be a priest and who was wearing clothing typically worn by a cleric, was refused leave to land and subsequently admitted that he was not in fact a priest.  Such deception is a global phenomenal that puts an onus on immigration authorities worldwide to strike a balance between the detection of illegal movements while at the same time facilitating the efficient throughput of bona fide passengers.  I am satisfied, having regard to the multitude of passengers that pass through our ports annually (25 million in Dublin Airport alone) that the Irish Immigration authorities strenuously work to achieve that balanced but effective approach.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that my Department received the formal application and supporting documentation from the United Kingdom authorities in March, 2008.  The matter was referred to the State&rsquo;s Legal Officers for advices in line with all such applications and these advices have been received.  Various reports were sought and have recently been received by my Department from bodies in this Jurisdiction.  I expect to make a decision on this application shortly. </P>
        <P>The Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered.  A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, i.e., from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned.  On receipt of those consents (assuming they will be forthcoming), an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his continued detention here.  On receipt of the High Court Warrant arrangements are then made for the transfer of the prisoner.  Applications for transfer to Ireland can take approximately eighteen months to process.</P>
        <P>These procedures are required under the Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, and must be adhered to in processing each application.  I should also advise the Deputy that the Convention does not confer an automatic right on any person to be transferred nor does it impose an obligation on any State to comply with a request for transfer.</P>

        <P>The person concerned, accompanied by her infant child, applied for asylum on 16 January 2004.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 12 September 2005, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her child.   She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her child should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned at that time.</P>
        <P>By letter dated 20 February 2008, the person concerned was notified of her entitlement to apply, within a defined time period, for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  While the person concerned did not submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State within the defined time period, she later submitted such an application and this application is currently under consideration.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned, and her legal representative, will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file is passed to me for decision.</P>

        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 1 March 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.

        <P>Following consideration of his case under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 27 April 2005.  Notice of this Order was served by registered letter, dated 4 May 2005, placing a legal requirement on the person concerned to &lsquo;present&rsquo; himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 12 May 2005 in order to make arrangements for his deportation <Col N="1046"/>from the State. The person concerned &lsquo;presented&rsquo;, as required, on this occasion but failed to &lsquo;present&rsquo; on a subsequent occasion and was therefore classified as a person who was evading his deportation.</P>
        <P>By letter dated 24 June 2008, the legal representative of the person concerned lodged an application for revocation of the Deportation Order, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). This application is under consideration at present. When a decision has been made on this application, this will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned and his legal representative.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government continues to attach the highest priority to finding a solution for our undocumented citizens in the United States.  At the same time, we have also argued that the long term strength of our bilateral relationship with the United States would benefit greatly by the establishment of new immigration arrangements which would facilitate greater legal migration between the two countries, an approach which was endorsed in the all-party motion passed in November 2007. </P>
        <P>In this context, we have this week concluded a new Working Holiday Agreement with the United States that will enable a minimum of 20,000 Irish citizens each year who are in, or have recently completed, post secondary education to work and travel in the United States for up to twelve months.  The new Working Holiday Agreement is reciprocal; under its terms, up to 5,000 US citizens will also be able to work and travel in Ireland on the same basis.  The Agreement is due to come into effect in late 2008.  Further detail on the terms of the Agreement is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.dfa.ie .</P>
        <P>The Agreement is a significant development in our visa arrangements with the United States.  Its signing is part of a three pronged set of objectives which I have been advocating during my visit to the United States this week , the other elements being our efforts to seek a solution for our undocumented citizens, and also new bilateral arrangements to provide long-term visas for Irish people wishing to work in the United States.</P>

As that letter pointed out, given the level of demand for funding and the amount of funding available under the Programme, it is not possible for my Department to allocate grants to every applicant.  In this instance, the club failed to meet a qualifying condition of the Programme in that the proof of title provided was not sufficient.</P>
        <P>As outlined in the reply to Parliamentary Question No 270 of 3 November 2007, in cases of existing registered leases of twenty-one years or more which are capable of supporting a charge, the applicant must provide evidence that the lease has been registered with the Property Registration Authority with a minimum of 15 years remaining.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 223 together.  </P>
        <P>The Community Services Programme (CSP) supports a range of community businesses and social enterprises to deliver local services and employment opportunities for particularly disadvantaged groups across the State.  At present, some 350 community-led organisations are being supported under the Programme to deliver a broad range of services and provide employment opportunities to over 1,660 people.  The level of funding allocated to these projects to date in 2008 is of the order of &euro;45m.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department took over responsibility for the operation of the CSP in 2006 when some 260 projects previously funded under F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s Social Economy Programme were transferred to the CSP.  I am currently considering how this programme could be streamlined and made more effective.</P>
        <P>The most recent call for proposals for the CSP closed at the end of June 2008.  In total, 254 applications were received and they are currently being processed.  Some 100 applications were received under the Community Halls and Facilities Strand, with 95 and 59 applications received under the Services and Enterprise Strands respectively.</P>
        <P>I expect recommendations regarding funding under the various strands to be made to me over the coming period.  The number of applications received under the recent call for each county is set out in the following table.</P>

        <Quest> the projects on a county basis that were allocated funding under the community services programme with details of the amount of funding allocated for each application category for the year 2006 and the year 2007. </Quest>

	<P>The Community Services Programme (CSP) supports a range of community businesses and social enterprises to deliver local services and employment opportunities for particularly disadvantaged groups across the State.  My Department took over responsibility for the operation of the CSP in 2006 when some 260 projects previously funded under F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s Social Economy Programme (SEP) were transferred to the Programme.  </P>
        <P>The amount of funds paid to each projects in 2006 and 2007 is set out in the following table.  With respect to categorisation, the table shows projects that transferred from F&Aacute;S and those funded under the 2006 call for proposals under the CSP.</P>
        <P>Given the broad range of services provided under the former SEP, the process of allocating groups to one of the current three strands under the Programme is still ongoing.</P>

	<P>From a total of 140 Departmental staff due to decentralise to Charlestown, Co. Mayo, 101 staff have now relocated to interim accommodation in Tubbercurry, Co. Sligo. In the period 3 July 2008 to date, 3 staff members took up duty in Tubbercurry and &euro;83,060 was incurred in respect of equipping and fitting-out of premises at that location. No properties were purchased by OPW in that period on behalf of my Department.  My Department had already fulfilled its commitment to relocate 10 posts to Na Forbacha, Co. Galway, prior to 3 July 2008.</P>

	<P>The Department supports government policy which aims to facilitate the greater use of electronic payment systems in the economy in the interests of developing a world class payments environment in Ireland.  Our payment strategy is designed to ensure that cost effective arrangements are in place for making payments to social welfare customers by using a range of payment options and to ensure that new payment facilities are made available to customers as they arise.</P>
        <P>The Department is implementing a three year strategy to change paper based payment instruments to electronic payments at post offices, banks and other financial institutions on a phased basis.  Currently some 80% of customers receive their payment electronically direct to their post office or financial institution.</P>
        <P>A range of measures are in place to inform customers being paid using pension books at post offices of the change in their payment method and to address any concerns they may have.  Each person is being informed by personal letter of the change in their payment arrangement.  A social services card, along with a covering letter explaining how to use the card, is also being issued to them.  Posters are being displayed in all post offices, citizen&rsquo;s information centres and throughout the Department&rsquo;s local office network.  In addition, the change from paper to electronic payment is a key element of all public information events, seminars and information briefings being carried out by the Department this year.</P>
        <P>An Post and the Irish Postmaster&rsquo;s Union (IPU) are committed to assisting customers to adapt to using a social services card to collect their payment.  Stakeholders and customer groups representing the elderly, people with disabilities, the unemployed and other groups have been consulted and have welcomed the move to electronic payment at post offices.</P>
        <P>The Department and An Post have put arrangements in place to enable the person who collect their payment by card to have an agent appointed if that becomes necessary.  A person can apply to have an agent appointed in the normal way and details of the agents name and address, will be sent electronically to An Post every week.  This facility has been operational <Col N="1064"/>since June 2008 and is working satisfactorily.  I am confident that the range of measures to inform customers of the change to electronic payment will ensure a smooth transition for them.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 and 228 together.  </P>
        <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent companies nation-wide operating the service.  Many voluntary and statutory bodies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Community Welfare Service, the Credit Union Movement, Citizens Information Centres, Centres for the Unemployed and local authorities work closely with the programme.</P>
        <P>In 2007, &euro;17.64 million was provided to fund the service.  To end of August 2008, a total of 10,800 new clients have approached the MABS, an increase of 2,500 clients over the same period in 2007.  The growth in demand for the service can be mainly attributed to the increase in the availability of credit and to the quality of the service provided by MABS advisors.  The MABS is highly regarded and successful in meeting the needs of its clients. In 2008, &euro;17.95 million was provided to assist the MABS in dealing with the increased workload.</P>

	<P>This case pertains to an individual who, being aged 64, working in Ireland, and in receipt of a UK Old Age Pension, is querying the PRSI Class at which she is liable to make contributions.</P>
        <P>As specified in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, Section 12 (1) (a), &lsquo;. . . every person who, being over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age, is employed in any of the employments specified in Part 1 of Schedule 1, not being an employment specified in Part 2 of that Schedule, shall be an employed contributor for the purposes of this Act&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>Under Section 2 of the Act &lsquo;pensionable age&rsquo; is defined as &lsquo;the age of 66 years&rsquo;.  As the individual in question is aged under 66 she is liable, as an employed contributor, to make Class A contributions, with the relevant sub-class being decided by the level of weekly earnings.</P>
        <P>The individual has suggested that she should be liable to pay Class J contributions.  However, liability to pay Class J contributions, as set down in Article 88 of Statutory Instrument 312 of 1996, pertains to &lsquo;an employment specified in Part 1 of the First Schedule to the Principal Act, where the employee has attained pensionable age&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the above that she is not liable to pay Class J.  The fact that she is in receipt of a UK Old Age Pension, which is based on a retirement age of 60, is irrelevant in this regard as eligibility is determined by age and employment status, rather than entitlement to a payment from another Member State.  Therefore no anomaly exists in relation to this matter.</P>

	<P>The Family Support Agency has responsibility for the Family Mediation Service, a free, professional and confidential service for couples, married and non-married, who have decided to separate or divorce and who together want to negotiate the terms of their separation or divorce with the help of a trained mediator.  Family mediation assists separating couples to look at the resources and options open to them and to reach an agreement that meets the interests of both and the interests of their children.</P>
        <P>There are 21 professionally trained mediators working for the service, all accredited by the Mediators Institute Ireland, the professional accrediting body for mediators in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Demand for the Family Mediation Service has always been strong and the expansion of the Service from 2 offices in 1997 to its present number of 16 reflects this Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide a nationwide service.</P>
        <P>The service assisted 1,497 couples in 2007.  Waiting times for an appointment at a Family Mediation Centre depends on the office and the nature and number of mediation sessions required by couples availing of the service.  On average the waiting time is 4 months.  If people are able to take up a cancellation at short notice their wait would be shortened.</P>
        <P>The average number of mediation sessions that couples attend range from three to seven.  This depends on the complexity of their issues, level of conflict, and the availability of clients for regular appointments, among other factors.</P>

	<P>The development of a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy is a key Government commitment in both the national partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; and the Programme for Government.  An inter-departmental/agency working group is currently developing the strategy.  The group is chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach with the secretariat provided by my Department.</P>
        <P>Developing the strategy involves a wide ranging consultation process which includes consultation with other government departments and bodies not represented on the working group.  In addition, a request for submissions from the public was published in regional newspapers.  There was a good response from individuals and organisations, including the Carers Association, and the submissions received are being examined.</P>
        <P>The commitment to the development of a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy also includes a commitment to appropriate consultation with the social partners.  An update in relation to the strategy was provided to the social partners plenary session in February.  The first of two consultation meetings with the social partners was held on 8 May 2008.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; commits the Department to hosting an annual consultation meeting of carer representative groups and relevant departments and agencies.  Such a meeting was held on 23 January 2008.  Representatives of 12 groups, including the Carers Association, and 9 government departments and bodies attended.  The theme was the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy and <Col N="1067"/>groups were given an opportunity to comment on the draft terms of reference and to raise other issues considered relevant in the context of the strategy.  The issues raised in this report along with key issues raised in the consultation process will be considered as part of the development of the strategy.</P>
        <P>In addition, to correspondence I have received from the Carers Association directly, I have also received representations from a number of colleagues on behalf of the organisation.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to launch the report &ldquo;Listening to Carers, Report on a Nationwide Carer Consultation&rdquo; produced by the Carers Association in partnership with Caring for Carers Ireland and Care Alliance on 30th of June this year.</P>

</table>        <P FLI="0">The Office of Public Works (OPW), who is charged with securing accommodation for the Programme of Decentralisation, has advised that no properties have been purchased from 3 July 2008 to date.</P>
        <P>Since 3 July 2008, 4 posts have relocated to Carrick-on-Shannon under the Programme of Decentralisation.  In the same period, 16 officers have transferred to other offices of the Department to fill vacancies created by the current programme and 11 staff members transferred to other Government Departments for the purpose of their decentralisation programmes.</P>
        <P>In addition, since 3 July 2008, 25 staff have been assigned to the Department in preparation for the relocation of business units to Buncrana and are currently based in Dublin and Letterkenny, pending the completion of accommodation in Buncrana.</P></Speaker>

        <Quest> the moneys under the decentralisation programme for the period from 3 July to date in 2008 that have been expended, properties purchased and employees decentralised specifying all relevant locations under each of these headings; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>There has been no expenditure on decentralisation by my Department in the period since 3rd July.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decision on decentralisation provides for the transfer of my Department&rsquo;s Dublin-based civil service staff, together with a number of military personnel, to Newbridge, Co. Kildare and for the decentralisation of the Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) to the Curragh.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Newbridge project, site acquisition, building construction and fit-out costs are borne on the Vote of the Public Works (OPW).  I understand that the total estimated cost of the project is approximately &euro;30 million.</P>
        <P>While close to 90% of clerical/administrative staff are now in place in preparation for the move to Newbridge, no staff have been moved to date.  The building is under construction and is expected to be ready for occupation by December 2009.</P>
        <P>In relation to the decentralisation of DFHQ to the Curragh, a state-owned site in the Curragh has been chosen for a new building.  The total cost and timescale for completion of the project will be determined by the outcome of the proposed tender competition which is being prepared by OPW and which is subject to approval of the necessary funding.  Expenditure on the project will be borne on the Vote for the OPW.</P>

	<P>My Department approved a tender for this project on 29 August 2007.  The local authority concerned, however, were unable to progress the matter until mid 2008.</P>
        <P>In the interim, under the Government&rsquo;s Construction Procurement Reform Process introduced to help address concerns about the extent of cost overruns on public works contracts, new contract procedures came into force.  These new contract procedures were announced in October 2006 and, following a generous transition period, were fully implemented from 13 February 2008.</P>
        <P>On 7 August 2008 my Department informed the local authority that these new procedures are applicable in the case of this project.  This matter was discussed further on 14 August last at a meeting between Council officials and my Department, and it was agreed that the new contract procedures must be complied with.  Should the local authority choose to re-tender for the project, the use of the new form of contract will provide greater certainty in terms of cost and delivery of the project and ensure that best value for money is achieved.</P>

	<P>My Department has received the correspondence referred to in the question.</P>
        <P>General purpose grants from the Local Government Fund are my Department&rsquo;s contribution to local authorities towards the cost of providing their day to day services.  Local authorities&rsquo; <Col N="1070"/>cost and income bases vary significantly from one another and calculating an appropriate distribution of general purpose grants is complex.  For the purposes of allocations, a range of factors is taken into account, including each local authority&rsquo;s expenditure on, and income from, each service, the overall amount of funding available for distribution and the need to provide each local authority with a reasonable allocation to provide an acceptable level of services for its customers.</P>
        <P>I will be announcing general purpose funding allocations for 2009 later this Autumn.</P>

	<P>Under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006 and the associated regulations, all development commenced on or after 1 October 1964 requires planning permission unless specifically exempted and, for this purpose, &ldquo;development&rdquo; means the carrying out of any <Col N="1071"/>works on, in, over or under land or the making of any material change in the use of any structures or other land.  While certain developments are exempted under section 4 of the Act and Part 2 and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended, there is no specific exemption for quarrying.</P>
        <P>Section 5 of the 2000 Act contains a provision enabling any person to seek a declaration from the relevant planning authority as to whether an activity is development or exempted development in any particular case: the planning authority&rsquo;s decision in the matter be referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for review in accordance with Section 5(3) of the Act.</P>

	<P>My Department provides funding towards the administrative and general expenses of certain not-for-profit organisations and bodies which provide information, research, training or support services in the area of housing.  Applications for funding in 2008, including an application from the promoters of the Safe Home Programme, are being examined at present. I intend to announce details of funding allocations very shortly.</P>
        <P>Decisions on funding for 2009 and later years can only be considered in light of the resources available each year and the level of competing demands for those resources.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256, 258 and 260 together. </P>
        <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 428 and 429 of 4th June 2008, and to Parliamentary Question No. 38 of 10 July 2008, Planning Permission was granted by North Tipperary County Council (NTCC) on 17th September 2007, for the rehabilitation work at the Gortmore Tailings Management Facility.  A tender notice was advertised in the EU Journal on 21st January 2008, following which seven companies were short-listed and invited to submit a tender for the first phase construction work of the rehabilitation works.  Tenders were received from all seven companies on 21st April 2008 and subsequently assessed by the consultants employed by NTCC to design and supervise the project.  On 21st May 2008, the Department authorised NTCC to issue a letter of intention to accept the tender of a construction firm for the first phase of the remediation works at the Gortmore site, at Silvermines, subject to the contractor producing insurances, bond and tax clearance.  These procurement procedures were in accordance with the latest guidelines issued by the Department of Finance for Government Departments and Local Authorities.  These works commenced in July.</P>
        <P>This complex project is being carried out on a phased basis and these initial works are planned to be completed in November 2008.  The works planned for 2009 and 2010 at the <Col N="1075"/>Gortmore site include further capping and associated works as well as vegetation and upgrading of wetland areas.  Further detailed planning and design work for Gortmore and the other sites involved in the project are still under active consideration.</P>
        <P>The project managers for the project have terminated their involvement as project managers.  An arrangement has been put in place to ensure project management continuity.</P>
        <P>As regards cost, as indicated previously, the sum of &euro;10.6m allocated by Government in June 2005 to remediate the former mining sites in the Silvermines area was on the basis of the earlier conceptual study.  On the basis of the latest information, it is clear that the cost of remediation of all the sites will exceed the provision of &euro;10.6m.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources expects to brief the Government on the revised costs of the project in the near future and on its implications for future annual funding for the project.</P>

        <P>The question of assistance to former miners, or any other type of employees, who suffer health problems as a consequence of working conditions in the past is, primarily, a matter between them and their employers, and in so far as the State is concerned, of disability or occupational injuries benefit entitlement under the social welfare code.</P>

	<P>The Government decision on the decentralisation of my Department is that some 600 headquarters staff will move to Portlaoise, the local offices in Cork city will move to Fermoy, involving some 100 staff; and the laboratories in Cork and Limerick will move to Macroom, involving up to 100 staff. The move of the Fisheries function of my Department to Clonakilty, involving over 80 staff, is now substantially complete.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s original Decentralisation Implementation Plan allowed for a phased movement to Portlaoise. The 2005, 2006 and 2007 advance phases of decentralisation to Portlaoise were completed on schedule. There has been an increase of some 300 full-time posts to bring the total posts in Portlaoise to almost 500 since the programme began. To date, the Department has met its targets as set out in its original plan.  The initial estimate for completion of the plan was 2008, to coincide with the availability of the permanent accommodation.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) announced last December that a consortium, the Macquarie Partnership, has won the tender for the project to build the permanent offices in Portlaoise (as part of a public private partnership including offices in Mullingar and Carlow) and planning permission for the new building has now been granted. A revision to the Department&rsquo;s Decentralisation Implementation Plan is now being considered, to reflect the changes to the building timetable and the progress so far, as well as the evolving operating environment. An additional advance phase has been agreed and planning and preparations for this phase are currently underway.</P>
        <P>Separate implementation plans for Fermoy and Macroom are in place. The plans allow for a phasing of the recruitment of staff but no physical move until the permanent accommodation is in place.  The acquisition of property is primarily a matter for OPW and they have supplied the following details of the site acquisition at the four locations.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Clonakilty offices are due to be completed in Quarter 1 2009.  All of the foregoing, however, need to be considered against the background of the Government decision on 8th July last that no further expenditure on the acquisition of accommodation for decentralisation should be sanctioned pending detailed consideration by the Government of two reports: one from the Decentralisation Implementation Group on the feasibility of phased moves by the State Agencies; and one from the Implementation Group of Secretaries General on the governmental and cross-Departmental issues arising from the need to provide facilities for Minister, Ministers of State and officials while in Dublin on business. It is expected that the Minister for Finance will present these to Government over the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>I consider that in the case of primary school teacher training it is essential that participants applying for the post graduate course meet the required criteria, as currently set down, which are common to all Colleges of Education that provide teacher training, and which include an honours level primary degree (a degree at Level 8 on the National Qualifications Framework) and a minimum of a Grade C3 at Higher Level in Irish in the Leaving Certificate or an approved equivalent.</P>
        <P>I have indicated my intention to commence Section 30 of Teaching Council Act later this year. Thereafter only registered teachers will be entitled to be paid on an ongoing or open-ended basis.  I also intend to provide for the use of unregistered personnel where this is a last resort for schools and work is ongoing in my Department to formulate the best manner in which this can be time limited.  The move to mandatory registration of teachers will be an important factor in progressively ensuring a fully qualified and registered teaching cohort.</P>

	<P>The priority rating of each individual building project is established in accordance with the Criteria for Prioritising Large Scale Projects (Primary and Post-primary) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.  In accordance with the criteria set down, each project is allocated to an appropriate priority band rating on the basis of objective criteria. A review of the criteria for prioritising large-scale projects was undertaken in consultation with the Education Partners in early 2004 to ensure that the criteria have the optimum precision and are fully tuned to meeting the priority accommodation needs of primary and post-primary schools. The revised criteria have been seen as bringing greater clarity and focus to the system. The amended criteria are applied to all projects that proceed to tender and construction. </P><Col N="1082"/>
        <P>The number of building projects under consideration can change on a day to day basis as new applications are received and existing applications are progressed in my Department.

Details of projects to move forward under the programme will be published as and when they are ready to be advanced in the context of capital expenditure requirements.</P>

Since the Summer Works Scheme was introduced in 2004, over 3,000 projects costing in excess of &euro;300 million have been completed. With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also showing the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. Accordingly my Department is focusing on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and there is no Summer Works Scheme this year.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 to 282, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002.  In considering the need to provide extra resources and teachers to schools in recent years, <Col N="1084"/>the Government prioritised putting the extra teachers into schools as soon as possible rather than making children wait until permanent accommodation could be provided in all cases.</P>
        <P>The rapid increase in the school going population has also meant that a large number of new schools have been established in recent years, under the process for the recognition of new schools conducted by the New Schools Advisory Committee.  It is the general practice of my Department not to provide permanent accommodation for schools which have only received temporary recognition.  When the school receives permanent recognition, it is then open to the school to apply for funding for permanent accommodation.</P>
        <P>Some schools with immediate additional accommodation needs are accommodated in prefabricated buildings, while others rent permanent premises.</P>
        <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not held by my Department on a county-by-county basis.  Nor does it distinguish between rental payments for permanent premises and prefabricated buildings. However, the information on overall expenditure for 2007 and to the end of August 2008 for rental of temporary accommodation in the primary and post-primary sectors is provided in the attached tabular statement.</P>
        <P>My Department grant aids schools to enable them to pay rent for approved temporary accommodation.  This grant aid is paid to the schools on submission to my Department of valid invoices verifying that the school is renting the accommodation in accordance with the terms under which sanction was given.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to provide funding for such prefabricated accommodation and the decision on whether to rent or purchase will depend on the likely length of time it will be required.  In all cases, the approach will be to ensure best value for money.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Summer Works Scheme has, since its introduction just a few years ago, transformed the standard of existing school accommodation.  With over 3,000 projects now having been funded under the scheme, my Department concentrated the investment in school buildings this year on delivering as many large projects as possible.</P>
        <P>While there was a focus on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department also delivered improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  The emphasis, however, was on new schools, extensions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects.  At primary level, schools were free to use their devolved minor works grant to address such works.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, there was no Summer Works Scheme as part of the Department&rsquo;s building programme in 2008.  This being the case, details in relation to the type of project and the estimated cost have not been collated by the Department.  I would also advise the Deputy that it is my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.</P>
        <P>The Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.</P>

	<P>Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.  It is a matter for the school to employ teachers up to the limit of its approved allocation and at its discretion to deploy those teachers to the subject areas that the school chooses to provide.</P>
        <P>A school authority may from time to time encounter unanticipated difficulty which it has not been in a position to immediately resolve, through its school planning and management processes in meeting essential curricular commitments to pupils within the normal staffing allocation.  In such circumstances, my Department will consider requests by a school authority for a staffing concession as short-term support.</P>
        <P>Over the past five years the school referred to by the Deputy had on average four teachers more than it was entitled to for a school of its size.  Over and above that, the Department granted additional teaching hours to the school to enable particular subjects to be taught.  These concessions were approved on the basis of allowing the school time to action a plan of curricular and timetable adjustments to enable the school to operate within its approved allocation limits.  This year such a request was not approved for this school on the basis that the school had been allocated concessions in previous years, had adequate opportunity to re-organise its subject <Col N="1088"/>options, had taken no effective action to operate within its allocation and continued to have more than three teachers in excess of its entitlement.</P>
        <P>An Independent Appeals Committee considers appeals by school authorities against decisions of my Department in regard to allocations of teaching staff.  The Appeals Committee operates independently of my Department. The school appealed to the Independent Appeals Committee and its appeal was not successful.  The school continued to make representations and has not given any indication that it is prepared to contemplate making any adjustments now or in the future. The school&rsquo;s inaction has resulted in a situation where a number of students preparing for the State Examinations could be left without teachers in certain subjects.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Appeals Committee had completed its work, my Department as a totally exceptional measure has made additional teaching hours available to the school to enable it cater for examination students in these classes.  This has been done in the interest of the students concerned while the Department continues to have an ongoing concern about the failure of this school to manage within its approved teacher allocation.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have recently announced a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools.  The term of office of the New Schools Advisory Committee (NSAC), which was set up to assess all applications for new primary schools, expired last month.  The terms of reference of the Committee were originally drafted in 1998.  Given the rapid growth in population and changing demographics in recent years, it is an opportune time to re-examine the criteria for the establishment of new primary schools.        </P>
        <P>I intend to establish a Technical Working Group under the Commission on School Accommodation to undertake a full review of the criteria and procedures for the recognition of new primary schools. Many issues will have to be addressed including both policy matters and practical issues raised by NSAC during the course of its work. Issues such as the minimum number of pupils required for the commencement of new schools, as well as a wide range of broad policy issues on school patronage and the approach to diversity of provision, need to be carefully considered.</P>
        <P>In the interim period, it is not planned to recognise any new primary schools except in areas where increases in pupil numbers that cannot be catered for in existing schools require the provision of new schools. This means that new schools will not be established for reasons not <Col N="1089"/>related to demographic growth in areas where there is already sufficient school accommodation or where the increases can be catered for by extending the existing school accommodation.</P>
        <P>This review does not mean that there will be a complete cessation of the school building programme outside of areas of rapid growth. This year alone, over &euro;586 million will be spent on the school building programme. One-third of that is being spent in rapidly developing areas.  This has resulted in the delivery of 12,000 new school places in 2008, a record number in any one year.  In addition to the establishment of new schools in areas of rapid population growth, the normal building programme of modernising, replacing or extending existing schools will continue and I intend making a further announcement in this regard at a later date.</P>

This is in respect of additional teaching hours required to allow for coordination and planning and for any other expenses related exclusively to the TYP. Since September 2007, the TYP grant was increased from &euro;63.49 to &euro;100 per pupil for the current school year.  There are no proposals to increase or redistribute funding for transition year programmes in schools located in the disadvantaged sectors. </P>

	<P>The project referred to by the Deputy is currently awaiting the appointment of a Design Team.  The commencement and progression of all large scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase, including this project, will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s Multi-Annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the further progression of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>I understand from the Office of Public Works that no properties have been purchased since 3 July, 2008.  In terms of non- property costs, &euro;25,749 has been spent by my Department on the decentralisation programme since July 2008.  Since 3 July, 2008, a further 17 posts have been decentralised to Athlone. I can confirm to the Deputy that at this stage my Department has completed the process of decentralising all sections due to relocate to Athlone.</P>
