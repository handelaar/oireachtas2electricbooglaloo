	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I launched the Government statement on transforming public services on Wednesday, 26 November.  In tandem with this statement, the report of the task force on the public service, the report of the organisational review programme and the Civil Service customer satisfaction survey 2008 were also published.  The cost of the launch, exclusive of VAT, was &euro;1,828, which includes the cost of catering and logistical arrangements on the day.</P>
        <P>The Government statement represents a comprehensive package for the transformation of the public service.  It is an ambitious three-year plan which we are determined to implement.  The package is designed to address the immediate priority of securing maximum value for public spending, made all the more urgent by recent Exchequer figures, and laying the foundation for a complete overhaul of how the public service is managed and does its business, to ensure that it is efficient and effective in meeting the needs of citizens.</P>
        <P>Last May, I appointed the task force on the public service to develop an action plan for the public service drawing on the analysis and recommendations of the OECD review of the public service which was launched in April.  The specific terms of reference of the task force were to prepare for consideration by the Government a comprehensive framework for renewal of the public service, which took into account the analysis and conclusions of the OECD review, as well as the lessons to be drawn from the strategic management initiative, the organisational review programme and the efficiency review process, and to recommend, in particular, how best to secure an overarching policy for an integrated public service that enables increased flexibility, mobility and staff development and supports the competencies and practices necessary for new networked ways of working within and across the broader public service; and the basis for determining the contribution which a senior public service could make to an integrated and cohesive public service.</P>
        <P>The task force was also asked to outline a set of criteria to inform the way in which the business of Government is structured and organised, with a strategy to enable necessary changes to be planned and implemented successfully; the benefits of the greater use of shared services across all sectors of the public service; and an appropriate framework for the establishment, operation and governance of State agencies.  In addition, it was asked to develop a strategy by which e-Government delivers coherent and citizen-focused services and more closely supports greater efficiency in administrative processes; and an implementation plan specifying the tasks and responsibilities necessary for the successful implementation of the renewal agenda, including the ways in which the principle of partnership with public servants and their representatives will be applied.</P>
        <P>The report of the task force, which has been adopted in full by the Government, sets out a challenging agenda for change in the public service.  It recommends an integrated package of initiatives to be implemented over a three-year framework focused on the following: first, achieving improved performance by organisations and individuals within the public service; second, creating flexibility in the deployment of people, assets and other resources; third, identifying the precise transformation agenda in each sector of the public service and engaging and mobilising the necessary actors; and fourth, achieving greater efficiency, effectiveness and economy.</P>
        <P>The report sets out an extensive list of recommendations, including prioritising and making more explicit the goals and targets of Government Departments and offices, communicating <Col N="779"/>these targets to the public, developing output indicators so that the performance of individuals and organisations across the public service can be measured, greater involvement of the citizen in policy and service delivery issues, greater use of e-Government and shared services, managing the business of Government in new ways and developing leaders in the public service.</P>
        <P>The work of the task force was extensive and included engaging with a number of key stakeholders concerned with the shape of the successful implementation of the renewal agenda.  I want to put on the record of the House my appreciation for the work of the individual members of the task force.  It was chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and my Department provided the secretariat.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to play a lead role in public service transformation as the actions outlined in the Government statement and the report of the task force are implemented.  I will chair a new Cabinet committee on transforming public services and the programme office being established to support implementation will be based in my Department.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Burton&rsquo;s question, I am aware that some media reports since the publication of the OECD report in April have contained a number of inaccuracies in regard to the process by which the OECD conducted its review.  In this regard, I understand the OECD has already clarified the record and stated that throughout the review process it maintained its objectivity and independence.</P>
        <P>The OECD is a sovereign organisation of member states and guards its independence.  It was given a free hand in the conduct of this review and unlike the experience in other countries, Irish officials were not present at interviews and meetings undertaken by the OECD as part of the review.  The Government did everything it could to encourage a bold approach by the OECD, including a major public consultation process whereby all 936 submissions were forwarded directly to the OECD.</P>
        <P>The OECD study was a peer review process.  We were reviewed by fellow OECD members and this involved extensive dialogue with and questioning of Irish officials by OECD staff and by a team of international experts drawn from the governments of five countries.</P>
        <P>As a result of detailed analysis, the OECD report recommended that the capacity needs of the public service in terms of numbers and skills need to be re-examined.  In this regard, the Minister for Finance has announced the establishment of a special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes.  The purpose of the special group, which has commenced its work, is to review the scope for reducing or refocusing the existing range of expenditure programmes, to critically examine the numbers of public servants employed across all areas of the public service, to assess the scope for transferring staff to priority areas and for reducing numbers overall, including identifying surplus staff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone is talking about public service reform, but as far as the Government is concerned we seem to be getting more reports than reform.  First, there was the OECD report, then there was a task force to implement the OECD report and then a Cabinet committee was established.  The Taoiseach tells us there is a programme office in his Department.  The Minister for Finance set up a special group which is, I presume, the group known as an bord snip nua or bord slash or whatever the common term.  Its purpose is to deal with matters in the public service.  Will the Taoiseach give some examples of what specific reforms we will see in six months&rsquo; time?  Will he identify two or three things, clearly visible to the public, that will have changed in the public service by that time arising from all of these reports and various bodies?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach referred to the task force putting an emphasis on shared services and on e-Government.  Will the Taoiseach explain what has happened with the website?  There was <Col N="780"/>supposed to be a common website for all the public services.  It was recommended and approved in 2003 and eventually delivered in 2005, some 16 months late.  It cost three times more than the allocated budget.  I understand it has cost approximately &euro;40 million to date and now it has been scrapped.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with the e-voting machines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Given there is such an emphasis on e-Government and shared services, will the Taoiseach provide some explanation as to why it was so expensive in the first place?  It is merely a website and &euro;40 million is a great deal to pay for a website.  Why was it so expensive in the first place and why has it now disappeared?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The questions relate to the public service transformation project in which we are now engaged.  There are ongoing reforms in the public service.  Many of the pay agreements are based on agreed changes in work practices, etc.  It is not a question of having a public service that mirrors exactly what it was in 1922, 1962, 1982 or 1992.  Several initiatives have taken place which have brought benefits.  In fairness, let us put that on the record.  They are designed to address the immediate priority of securing maximum value from public spending and this is made even more urgent by recent Exchequer returns.</P>
        <P>In the next six months, one expects to see agreements on more flexible ways of operating and changes in work practices.  As the Towards 2016 ten year framework agreement puts it, these agreements will focus on putting at the centre of our concern the citizen and the way in which we provide services to the greatest extent possible, given the available level of resources.  At question is the level of resources that can be applied to these areas.  If we are to do this, it will involve much change in the workplace.  That process of engagement with the social partners is ongoing.  In a range of areas within the private and semi-State sectors, unions and management are making provisions for new arrangements to maintain, to the greatest extent possible, job security and the maximum number of jobs in a difficult climate.  This is taking place across the board and must happen in the State sector within the public service.  Such an engagement will now begin with a great degree of urgency in the context of the 2009 financial year and the difficulties we face therein.  There will be a great number of changes in this respect.</P>
        <P>As for the recommendations themselves, the establishment of an integrated public service in which people will have freedom to move across and work within various aspects of that service, such as the local authority system, the public administration system, the Civil Service itself or the non-commercial semi-State sector, will involve a process of engagement with the public service unions on which the Government will embark.  I refer to the redesign of the service, which must take place over the three-year timespan that has been outlined and, while I do not need to refer to them specifically in this reply, the various recommendations and timeframes within which progress is expected to be made across the various areas, as set out in the report.  While I do not wish to take up the time of the House with them at present, there is a clear need to do those things.</P>
        <P>As for e-Government, were a specific question to be tabled on a specific issue pertaining to this website, I could get the detail on it for the Deputy.  However, I make the point that e-Government certainly must improve.  One major item to arise from the surveys on public satisfaction is that people are unable to get common information to the extent they would wish and that there are delays.  Moreover, the level of available knowledge when people contact the public service is not as they would wish in some respects.  This has been set out in the customer survey and the need to improve in this regard is reflected in the implementation plan the Government now has put in place to change how the public service works, what it does and <Col N="781"/>what numbers are deployed.  The plan will examine what are the outputs, whether people are in the right places &mdash; there are indications to the contrary at present &mdash; how to redeploy people and how to move people to priority areas.</P>
        <P>This will involve engagement with public service unions, that is, with public servants and their representatives, and this report sets out how the Government intends to so do.  In the first instance there is the immediate question, about which the group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes will play a part by advising the Government as to what it considers should happen in this regard.  However, the Government will be obliged to make the decisions itself.  Moreover, the wider social partnership process must not be forgotten in this respect.  I refer to the need to engage, in an accelerated way, on how to change work practices in order that service levels in 2009 will be maintained for the amount of money that will be provided.  The third and more medium-term issue concerns the redesign of the service itself in respect of the freeing up of deployment and redeployment issues etc., as well as the establishment of a senior public service.  This also is set out in the report over a three-year period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has done a very good job of describing the process by which the Government addresses public service reform in respect of the various consultations, reports, studies and different groups that are set up to do this, that or the other on public service reform.  However, the Taoiseach has not told Members what are or what are likely to be the outcomes.  I asked the Taoiseach to identify a couple of specific areas he might share with the House in which in six months time, as a result of all these processes, the public will be able to see some tangible results.  The Taoiseach is correct to state the public service is quite different from what it was in 1922, 1982 or 1992.  Twenty years ago, were one to telephone a public office, one would get to talk to a person.  At present, were one to do so, one would be presented with a menu asking one to press buttons A, B or whatever it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Number eight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for several minutes before eventually being sent full circle.</P>
        <P>The alternative is to look up the website.  Incidentally, the Taoiseach has not answered this part of the question either.  The idea was there would be a single website containing all public service information.  It was to have been a one-stop shop, at which those who wished to get information about public services could access a particular website that would be able to navigate and get the information required.  Moreover, if one needed to go from one Department to another or from one service to another, one could do that.</P>
        <P>There was an attempt made to establish such a website at very considerable cost to the public &mdash; we are now told &euro;40 million.  However, it took so long and it cost so much, and it eventually duplicated some of the things that were there already, that the Comptroller and Auditor General issued a report on it last year and now it is closed down.  If the Government cannot establish a website describing the way in which public services are integrated, what confidence do we have that it will be able to integrate the services themselves?</P>
        <P>The public does not need to hear a litany of what the process involves, this task force and that task force or this study and that study, and new working groups and new action groups etc.  The public needs to see tangible results, something to which one can point that a particular service either is improved or will be improved in six months&rsquo; time as a result of all of these initiatives of which we hear so much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have explained to the Deputy that I am not talking about process.  I am talking about changes that now have to be negotiated with public service unions in the same way as many of those unions, or their like in other areas of the economy, are engaging in <Col N="782"/>change programmes as we speak in order to survive in the marketplace in which they operate.  I expect that within the next six months &mdash; or before it &mdash; we will have to see agreements drawn up which will provide for far more flexibility in the delivery of our health services, how we are organised and how we get more for the amount of money that we are providing.  All of that process will be accelerated and accordioned in the next couple of months if we are to have outcomes which avoid unnecessary cuts in services because we were not prepared to make the changes in how we organise their delivery.</P>
        <P>I believe that there is a strong willingness on all sides of that equation, both at management and union levels, to make the necessary changes and to bring in new flexibilities in how we organise services in a way which has not been possible to be negotiated for some time simply because everyone recognises that we are in a situation that requires that sort of response.  Those are the sort of practical changes that one will see because people are willing and understand that if we are to avoid unnecessary dislocation of services at the front line, people will have to change how we deliver the system.  We must achieve more efficiencies &mdash; that is the way it is.  I believe everyone is up for that challenge.  The social partnership provides us with the framework to achieve that.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore makes a criticism of when people go about trying to change the public service in some isolated or specific case.  The purpose of this OECD review is to look at the entire service to outline how we can improve motivation and performance, how we get to deepen citizen engagement, how we get the potential for e-Government to work, how we provide the economies that will be available through shared services, how we develop people and develop leaders within the service who will be able to go and manage what is a multibillion euro operation, how we strengthen the governance of these organisations, including the agencies, and how we ensure that the public service works in an accountable, transparent and effective way that will increase public confidence in the country.</P>
        <P>It sets out an implementation strategy.  On the arguments that people were decrying the fact that we were not setting out a plan over a three year period covering all of these issues, ambitious timeframes are set out.  I do not need to read each and every one of them, but each chapter sets out that they are not simply recommendations, but recommendations within certain timeframes.  If one wants to change how the public service works, one must have a beginning, a middle and an end to it.  One must start at a point that creates the means by which one gets the changes rather than everyone going about doing their own thing.  The purpose of bringing that group of people together was to give us an implementation plan, based on what the OECD had to say, on what way we could improve the service and how we could go about it.</P>
        <P>Quite apart from that redesign of the service, which is a reform issue that needs to be addressed, there are the specifics about which Deputy Gilmore spoke in terms of changes in the workplaces that must occur in the immediate period ahead on a range of public services in order to ensure the outputs we get are commensurate for the inputs we make.</P>
        <P>We also know that a gap is emerging between the tax revenues we are raising as a country, which are at 2005 levels, and the 2009 level of services we have to provide.  That is not sustainable in the medium to long term and we have to get down to the business of reducing that discrepancy over a credible timeframe so that we bring the public finances back into balance as quickly as possible.  However, by working through the social partnership, this will be done in a way that avoids to the greatest extent possible an adverse effect on those who depend on these services.  That is the shared responsibility not only of the Government, Ministers or Departments but of everyone who works in the service.  The quality of leadership required to successfully achieve that aim will be of a high order.  That is why we need the social partnership process to work.  The purpose of the engagement that will begin in the coming weeks is to <Col N="783"/>ensure we get down to the business of providing the best possible level of service from the State&rsquo;s depleted revenues and depleting resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach draws his authority and strength from the Constitution and the people.  His leadership does not come from agencies or reports commissioned by the Government.  One of the hallmarks of what I regard as the failure of this Government and its predecessors has been the devaluation of the public service by the commissioning of report after report from outside consultants which in many cases could have been done within the public service and behind the recommendations of which the Government hides.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">In respect of the new body, the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, a ludicrous situation appears to have arisen.  Last year the Government set out its programme for Government and the budget and capital allocations for various programmes which Ministers would implement in their respective Departments as part of the public service.  Before the year was out, another board was established to take some of this money back from Ministers and Departments.  Surely the Ministers appointed by the Taoiseach should see to it that the money allocated to them by the Government achieves value for the purpose for which it was intended.  An bord snip nua, as the new body is known, is now required to do the work and make the recommendations when Ministers should know what is to happen in their Departments.  Will the body&rsquo;s report be published and will we see its recommendations?  Does the Taoiseach agree it is ludicrous that in the course of one year the Cabinet solemnly proposed votes in respect of moneys for programmes and expenditure to be spent under Ministers and then asked for recommendations on how they could be drawn back?</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s task force for the public service recently recommended a move to a common public service contract to facilitate the transfer of staff to priority areas.  When is that likely to take effect and will it require legislation?  It is an important recommendation in terms of the quality of the public service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of undertaking a comprehensive review and transformation of the public service requires in the first instance an analysis which is hopefully objective.  An organisation such as the OECD is more likely to be objective than an internal review, which if conducted by the Government would immediately be regarded by the likes of Deputy Kenny as inadequate.  The OECD was commissioned to conduct the review and I set out in my earlier reply its extensive, comprehensive and independent nature.  It pointed to some strengths in the service and to the good things we are doing as well as to areas where, as a result of the way they developed, we need to reconsider the organisational remit in order to determine how we can better organise the delivery of public services.</P>
      
        <P>Upon receiving the extensive and comprehensive report, we asked a number of people from within the public service, as well as people in business with a competence or interest in the area, or who had management experience of change programmes in other sectors, to set out an implementation programme for the comprehensive change envisaged in the OECD report.  We have now received the report and are in the process of implementing it.  That is the right way to go.</P>
        <P>If the process is to be done properly, an overview should be taken by others of the strengths and weaknesses of the system.  The peer review process should be done by others rather than within the service, where people will have a certain view that there is not much wrong at all.</P>
        <P>There are people within the service who want to get on with having modern performance benchmarks in place where underperformance can be dealt with and where the need for deployment and flexibility, training and the provision of leadership can be dealt with.  This leadership <Col N="784"/>takes in how to identify and motivate people who can lead in these areas to manage what is a very complex series of organisations delivering critical services for the citizens of the country.  We should not be simplistic about it while suggesting it is not an area which can be reformed.  It can and it will be reformed.</P>
        <P>Another point was made on getting in an outside body.  The allocations made during the course of 2008 for Ministers were adhered to in the main and we have been able to come in within those expenditure parameters.  After the six-month Exchequer returns we saw the rate of deterioration in our tax revenues which led to a gap, and we made decisions on making economies in our spending to ensure we came within what we set out to achieve this year.  In the second six months of the year we identified further full-year savings, and these have been confirmed.  Those savings remain in place with full-year effect for 2009.</P>
        <P>The deterioration in our public finance position and the tax revenues coming in on that side have come as part of the global recession, which affects us no differently than anyone else.  The rate of the deterioration has been such that we have ended up in the position of being down between 13% and 15% in tax revenues on what could have been expected based on growth forecasts from everybody in this economy as of November last year.  That has opened a gap of &euro;8 billion that needs to be closed.</P>
        <P>We have insisted we will try to do that while not totally undermining our capital investment programme, the means by which we can build up capacity in the country, as well as the road and other transport networks.  It will also build up our education system with school buildings, colleges, universities and institutes of technology etc.  There are other areas of social spending, for example, we will spend &euro;1.6 billion on social housing next year.  All those allocations remain in place because we must provide those services through capital investments.</P>
        <P>We have a gap in our current day to day spend that will have to be closed over a period.  We need social partnership on the basis that I believe it is a problem-solving process rather than a problem-avoiding process.  We will decide over a credible timeframe how we will close the gap and at the same time, to the greatest possible extent, adhere to the 2016 partnership principles.  They are about trying to improve this society over the period ahead, knowing that the envisaged growth in revenues that fed into the ambition of that programme will now have to be modified as those resources will not be available to any Government in the immediate years ahead.</P>
        <P>One either decides to do this in a way that is inclusive, participatory and gets people around a certain set of problems on the basis of a common analysis and understanding of the choices for dealing with them or we end up in a position that puts at risk the benefits deriving from such an approach.  I believe that collaborative approach is the right one.  It is not about outsourcing the Government&rsquo;s responsibility regarding expenditure programmes or public service numbers, whether in respect of the particular advisory body the Deputy is talking about or others.  Ultimately, the Government remains responsible for the political decisions it will have to take, but it will do so on the basis of the best advice and collaboration that we can muster in a limited timeframe, working with the people who have been part of this country&rsquo;s success in the past.  When the pressure comes on in tough times it is all the more reason why one should work in that way, rather than simply regarding it as a process to be used when it comes to the dispersal of extra resources that came about because of the good times we had in the past.  That is the approach that is being taken.</P>
        <P>Common public service contracts constitute one of the recommendations to provide for easy flexibility across services, with local authority staff coming into the Civil Service.  That cannot be provided by fiat, but will have to be negotiated with public service unions.  People have to buy into this process of transformation for public service reform also.  We intend to proceed <Col N="785"/>with it and will work with people in that regard, but we have a voluntary industrial relations culture which must be respected.  We will have to sit down with people to get through that process.  The benefit of the task force report we are discussing in these series of questions is that they have visibly set out for all stakeholders in the service how we will proceed in prioritising the work as identified in this report, which also reflects the OECD&rsquo;s priorities.  That is the way to proceed but it will not be done by a Minister going off into a corner and devising a common contract saying &ldquo;Here it is, I have it&rdquo; and when it is published, saying &ldquo;Am I not very efficient because I have done it within a week of the report&rsquo;s publication?&rdquo;  That is nonsense and it is no way to govern.  One must sit down with those affected by the proposed reforms and get their agreement on the basis that it will improve the workplace and career prospects, and provide training for people in the service so they can achieve their potential.  It should get away from crisis management and get on with the more strategic approach that respects the various stakeholders&rsquo; positions in this reform programme process.  It will probably best guarantee its success by doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach, for once, in that it is not about governance where Ministers go off into a corner and make up their own minds.  However, that is exactly what the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, did when he announced his decentralisation programme.  It involved 10,000 civil servants moving to 53 locations over three years, but he never told anyone &mdash; well, maybe two &mdash; before announcing it.  The Taoiseach derives his authority from the people, not from any of these agencies or reports.  The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, commissioned 120 reports.  Some of the most brilliant people I have ever met work in the public service and they have always played their part above and beyond the call of duty.  The point is, however, that if they are asked or challenged to provide the answers to political or public service problems that the Government might face at any one time, they will invariably provide a list of options.  In many cases, they will not require outside consultants to do reports in the first instance.  The Taoiseach spoke of leadership in that regard but he draws his authority from the people, not from consultancy reports.  I admit that such reports may be necessary in some cases if they are of a technical or specialist nature.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach spoke of economies in spending and I agree with that.  The Taoiseach should ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who is beside him, about that.  An operation may cost approximately &euro;5,000 for someone on a waiting list, but why is it that under the National Treatment Purchase Fund the same operation, carried out by the same consultant, can cost &euro;15,000?  We are seeking economies of scale but surely this is ludicrous.  It could be in someone&rsquo;s interests to keep a long list of people for the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  For example, the same operation could cost three times as much.  This is not in the interests of the taxpayer or the general economy.  Does the Taoiseach view this type of practical change, which he spoke of, in the interests of the economy and the people as something on which he would follow through?</P>
        <P>Does the Government intend to consider linking the system of awarding annual pay increments in the public service with enhanced performance?  In offices and elements of the public service, there are people who show great creativity and initiative, but they are swamped and stalled by the system.  It might be in everyone&rsquo;s interests to consider the system of awarding annual pay increments and to link them more clearly with performance.  This would give many public servants an opportunity to give of their best in the knowledge that they would be rewarded for their work.</P>
        <P>In the context of public service reform, has the Government turned its thoughts to a voluntary redundancy scheme?  The Minister for Health and Children, who is sitting beside the <Col N="786"/>Taoiseach, referred to a voluntary scheme within the HSE.  What is the Government&rsquo;s position on the overall public service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the question of reports being commissioned by Departments, it cannot be suggested that, within our public service or within each Department, there is the total level of expertise necessary to give full and frank advice on every aspect of what is a very complex service delivery system.  Even taking the number mentioned, that of 120 reports in the Department of Health and Children, some 98% of the problems, dossiers and files that are dealt with by the Department where decisions are taken are done without any reference to a report.</P>
        <P>If one is trying to develop a public policy position or to change a policy in order for it to gain greater acceptance among various stakeholders in, for example, the pharmacy area, the Irish Medicines Board area or the question of how one can improve the delivery of disability services, one would often bring in various stakeholders and ask some independent person to work and collaborate with them, listen to the various points of view and come forward with a set of proposals arising from that process.  These things are not necessarily expensive.</P>
        <P>Taking the report in question as an example, there was a need to get someone from outside the country to do a peer review to determine how well the Irish public service was doing compared to other public services, the ways in which it was different, whether it was ahead of or behind others and whether any best practice models in other countries could be applied to the Irish public service.  The OECD, which has done a lot of work in this area and in public administration and policy formulation generally, was the obvious group to take on the task.  It took whatever time was necessary and did it in a very comprehensive fashion, as I have outlined in my reply.</P>
        <P>If doing a report is a precursor to pulling a range of diverse opinions behind a means forward to deal with some of these issues, on a cost-benefit analysis it is very much the right thing to do.  If it charts a way forward, as this task force now does by pushing the buttons in respect of all areas to determine how to bring about public service reform, it is a far more cost effective way of doing it than allowing each sector to go at its own pace and to do its own thing, some successfully and others not so much because there is no overall systemic response that would bring about a coherent outcome.</P>
        <P>Sometimes, this idea that one can only have an effective Government if no one reports to it about some issue is a simplified and populist message.  I am sure that it goes down well with certain elements, but it is not necessarily a very accurate assessment of how modern governance systems can work in a modern democracy.</P>
        <P>Regarding the National Treatment Purchase Fund, I do not know the specific case to which Deputy Kenny referred or how accurate he was.  However, as a mechanism for increasing throughput in the health service and identifying people who have been awaiting treatments, its contribution to improving waiting times has been a great success.  When I served as Minister for Health and Children, waiting times were between two to five years whereas they are now between two to five months.  Last year alone, waiting times were reduced in 60% of the categories to which such waiting times apply.  Improvements continue to be made.</P>

	<P>In respect of specific areas, the Minister has, as she is entitled to do under the various Acts, indicated the priority action she wants to be taken in the context of the service plans the Health Service Executive has presented to her for the purpose of outlining <Col N="787"/>how services will be applied next year.  That is part of the process.  She has been able to make informed decisions based on the up-to-date statistical analysis provided in the annual report of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This is another example of the system working rather than not doing so.  The system is improving the situation for ordinary citizens in the context of obtaining access to important health services, such as operations and surgical procedures.</P>
        <P>On enhanced performance and how to provide recognition or acknowledgement, financial or otherwise, to those managers or staff in the health service who are working well and meeting their targets, the task force is of the view that the transparent performance management system must be strengthened and developed.  There is then the question of how to provide recognition such as that to which I refer in a way that will incentivise performance and allow people to pursue excellence to the greatest extent possible while also eliminating underperformance, which is a major problem.  In such circumstances, one must negotiate and work with staff representatives on how best to proceed.  I do not have a difficulty with this in principle, but we must also maintain the public service ethos, which is an important consideration.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach referred to sitting down with the people affected and recognises that this is a crucial aspect in the context of the social partners.  However, the task force did not include representation from all the key sectors.  There was representation from the private sector but consumers, trade unions and the NGOs were not represented.  Given that it has published its action plan, does the Taoiseach envisage that the task force will remain in place?  If it does remain in place and in the context of his comments on sitting down with the people affected, does he propose to include representation on it from the various sectors to which I refer?</P>
        <P>In light of the fact that the deliberations of the task force took place against a backdrop of cuts and an ever-tightening economic reality, there is great concern that the implementation of the action plan will represent a further facilitation of cuts within the public service.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>During the past 12 months the public finances deteriorated following the extremely rapid decrease in growth rates.  As a result, the economy is now contracting.  This raises serious challenges for us in the short to medium term.  I intend using the social partnership process as a means of seeking to address that issue in a timeframe that is credible at home and abroad.</P>
        <P>Due to my interest in defending public services, I believe one should be in favour of public service reform.  It is in the interest of upholding public confidence in public services that we be involved in public service reform.  Reforms are taking place in every sector of the economy not alone in respect of competition in the environment in which we now operate but in respect of <Col N="788"/>the new environment in which we will have to operate.  Decisions and deals are being done between management and unions in every sector of the economy in order to maintain jobs to the greatest extent possible even though, as we know, this is predicated on the possibility of increased joblessness as the recession deepens and lengthens.  This is what we must face up to.</P>
        <P>The public sector is, in my opinion, willing to respond in the same way in respect of the delivery of efficient and effective public services.  If we want to avoid, to the greatest extent possible, any diminution in front line services we must be prepared to deliver those services in a different manner than up to now.  The one sure way of ensuring a problem in this area is to insist on delivery of such services in the same manner as up to now.  This wider reform process, which is about redesigning the public service in the longer term, is a related issue, one which is just as urgent in terms of it having to be done over a certain timeframe, which is three years according to the recommendations.  The recommendations have been made and we must now sit down with the unions and ensure the plan is implemented.</P>
        <P>In respect of the immediate challenge ahead, in terms of our problem in respect of public finances, this will happen in the weeks and months ahead through social partnership engagement, which will be intensive and will seek solutions to these problems over a credible timeframe and, which will have the objective of maintaining front line services as best we can within the resources available.  This can best be achieved through the flexibilities and work practices necessary to bring about a more effective public service.</P>

	<P>There is no proposal to spend &euro;78 million on a computer system to replace PPARs.  The Deputy may, however, be referring to a draft business plan for financial and procurement systems received by my Department in September of this year.  This included proposed capital costs of just under &euro;78 million.</P>
        <P>The draft business plan has since been discussed with the HSE and revised proposals involving lower investment levels are being developed by the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the fine print around the &euro;78 million, at a time when we cannot afford vaccines for children, will the Minister outline to the House how she proposes to ensure this does not end up being another fiasco like PPARs?  It is extraordinary this issue is only now being dealt with given the Minister has held this portfolio for the past four years.  </P>
        <P>The HSE report was today leaked on the airwaves.  I want to know why it was not laid before this House given it deals with issues that affect every man, woman and child.  This is the proper place for that report to be released, not on the national airwaves.  I remind the Minister of the failed launch, on three occasions at a cost of &euro;2 million, of the HSE Portal website, which is now merely a myth.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister comment on the remarks of her financial comptroller on the 1 o&rsquo;clock news today that the HSE over-performed last year?  How does she propose to sell this to the relatives <Col N="789"/>of Graham Dempsey from Cork, who has been left on a trolley for 30 hours and whose nappy is being changed in public view; to the family of Beverly Seville-Doyle who died in accident and emergency at the Mater Hospital; to the family of 77 year old Peg McEntee who was left for three days on a trolley; to the lady in Cork left on a trolley for 48 hours whose oxygen ran out; or to a patient of mine who as late as last month was left on a trolley for 48 hours?</P>
        <P>It beggars belief that we can have statements to this effect.  I wonder how the Minister intends to reassure the public given the 400-bed reduction last year, the proposed cut of 600 beds this year, the fact that 750 beds are being blocked by patients needing discharge but who have nowhere to go and the review of eight accident and emergency departments in Dublin with a view to reducing them to four.  Today, there are 390 people lying on trolleys at hospitals around the country, which is a disgrace.</P>

        <P Just="Left">On technology, the famous PPARs initiated in 1995 by six health boards does not meet the requirements of a unified service.  One of the difficulties with it was that it was not &ldquo;specked&rdquo; appropriately initially and the anticipated cost was not correct.  Notwithstanding the experience with PPARs, we must not be frightened or run away from the need to invest in information communications technology within our health system.</P>
        <P>The HSE spends &euro;8 billion annually on pay and employs 70,000 people.  Technology will be enormously beneficial in our ensuring we have in place an appropriate information and financial control mechanism.  Any of the health systems which I have had an opportunity to view, and all of the Ministers with whom I have engaged, who have invested heavily in technology have reported huge efficiencies as a result.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the inadequacies of PPARs, it did throw up the fact that there were more than 1,000 variations in work practices among those people covered by it.  That is a fact.</P>

	<P>As I stated, PPARs was initiated by a number of health boards in 1995 following the publication of the health strategy in 1994.  It was felt by a number of health boards, including some hospitals, that we needed to invest in a payroll system.  That payroll system, which later became known as PPARs, and which is currently operating in a large number of places, has brought to light many deficiencies, inadequacies and variations in work practices.  Technology is important if we are to drive greater efficiency in the interest of patient care.  I do not want the Deputy or anybody else to think we can operate a modern health service without investing considerably in technology.</P>
        <P>The HSE is currently recruiting a director of ICT.  Interviews in this regard are currently under way.  This is important.

	<P>Perhaps the Minister will answer the following question.  Some &euro;180 million was spent on PPARs.  We all accept there is need for modernisation of our information technology.  The Minister continually speaks of value for money.  How will she ensure we receive value for money this time and that we will not be faced with another fiasco, as happened on previous occasions?  The Minister has held this portfolio for the past four years.  It is hardly this morning she woke up and discovered this problem.

Clearly, we must learn from that experience because at the end of the day that was taxpayers&rsquo; money, whether spent by a unified organisation or by individual health boards.  Considerable progress has been made by the Health Service Executive with the assistance of expertise in respect of its information communication technology requirements.  They are currently in discussion with my Department and the Department of Finance in regard to investment in this area during 2009.</P>

        <Quest> her views on the number of people who spend long hours on trolleys in hospital accident and emergency departments; the action she will take to relieve the situation this winter; if she will introduce some measure to provide alternative care for the 700 plus people who are ready for discharge but who have nowhere to go; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE has made considerable progress in improving the delivery of services in emergency departments.  The vast majority of hospitals are now fully or substantially compliant with the 12-hour target for those requiring admission.  The Health Service Executive introduced this target in October last year.  Patient waits of longer than 24 hours, following a decision to admit, have been totally eliminated in 21 of the 34 hospitals concerned, while a further eight have infrequent waits of that duration.  The HSE will continue to work closely with all hospitals to maintain their improvements and to address the remaining problems, which are largely confined to a small number of hospitals.</P>
        <P>I have also asked the HSE to set a revised maximum waiting time target of no more than six hours from registration to admission or discharge in 2009 for all patients attending emergency departments and to introduce a measurement system in 2009 to record the total waiting time for all such patients.  The HSE has committed to introducing those measures in its 2009 national service plan.</P><Col N="791"/>
        <P>By the end of this year, 279 additional long-stay beds will have been made available to patients under the fast-track initiative.  A further 503 new long-stay beds will be provided under the initiative next year.  In addition, in early 2009, the HSE will provide 245 additional contract beds to alleviate delayed discharges pressure on the acute hospital system.</P>
        <P>During 2009, the HSE will review the existing arrangements whereby 11 hospitals in Dublin and three in Cork operate emergency departments 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The review will consider whether it is necessary to maintain full emergency department services in each hospital beyond the peak hours of operation and whether that represents the best use of resources.  The HSE will also continue the work which is under way in reviewing the configuration of hospital services, including emergency department services, in the north east, mid-west and southern regions.  That will include a review of the operation of emergency department services in hospitals with low volumes of activity in order to ensure that such services are configured in a way that optimises clinical outcomes for patients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has laid the HSE&rsquo;s plan before the House and it is on the Order Paper today.  I find it extraordinary that it is not properly and publicly announced by the HSE or the Minister and that it is sneaked in on the list without any information to the public.  It seems to me that is much of the problem with the health service currently.</P>
        <P>In the plan the Minister intends to cut more than &euro;500 million from the HSE&rsquo;s spending budget.  Can she give a guarantee to the public that front-line services will be maintained in that context?  Accident and emergency services are due to close down at various times in Dublin, Cork and other parts of the country.  Given that yesterday, 339 patients were on hospital trolleys and, as Deputy Reilly indicated, even more patients are on trolleys today, how will accident and emergency services be provided when the problem has reached that level already?  People on trolleys are unable to access acute hospital beds while other people occupy beds who could be cared for in the community.  If services are to be cut next year with fewer hours of accident and emergency services available, how will it be possible to maintain services at their current level let alone improve the situation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan is familiar with the proposals tabled by the HSE to the various employee representatives.  She was well briefed prior to the previous attendance of Professor Drumm at the D&aacute;il committee.  Essentially, the HSE has tabled a number of proposals requiring greater flexibility.  We want to treat more patients next year on a day-case basis, in line with best practice not only in Ireland but internationally.  Clearly, to do that we require changes in how people work.  We need to reduce in particular the level of dependence on overtime by many staff in the health service and having people in hospital at weekends when they should be discharged.</P>
        <P>The new consultant contract will be a key to the reform of how hospitals operate because for the first time consultants will work as part of teams with a clinical director, working days will be longer, structured cover will be in place at weekends and seven-day discharges will be introduced.  All of those elements are important in order to ensure we optimise the use of the acute hospital system.  However, I have made clear that there will be challenges next year.</P>
        <P>Specifically in relation to A&amp;E, we have three children&rsquo;s accident and emergency units open in this city 24/7.  It is expensive to staff accident and emergency departments 24/7, but during the night I think it is something in the region of 20 visits is the average attendance, between the three units, between the hours of 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.  It would be in all our interests if we can reorganise our services better during those night-time hours.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many of the attendances at accident and emergency units are not strictly accident and emergency cases and could and should be dealt with at primary care level.  As Professor Drumm <Col N="792"/>indicated at the committee, the hope is that more activity will be switched to the level of primary, community care rather than the focus being constantly on hospital attendance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>With due respect to the Minister, we cannot live on hope.  It is a fact that people present themselves at accident and emergency units.  What exactly will change?  When people present at accident and emergency units they require treatment or to be dealt with in some fashion.  If accident and emergency service hours are being cut back in some hospitals, how will they cope with the numbers of people presenting?  The numbers of people presenting next year will not be reduced next year because the Minister has decided she would like them to.  What exactly will happen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fact that in many hospitals in this city we have more staff than attendances on a daily basis at accident and emergency units.  In some hospitals the ratio is 1:1.  No health system in the world of which I am aware can sustain that ratio of staff level to patient care.  In the context of next year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the reality we are hearing about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Separate issues arise that relate to safety, who is on-call, and volumes of activity that are being dealt with in the context of the mid-west and the north east.  The reality is that patient safety issues arise in those places where there is a low level of throughput.  I can supply the Deputy with the figures for each of the hospitals in Dublin on a daily basis.  I can show her that in some cases we have more staff than patients.  If we can reorganise accident and emergency opening hours, especially late at night and during the night, in consultation with staff representatives, which is the intention, in the first half of next year, we can deliver better patient care in a more cost-effective fashion and we can allow more of the elective activity to proceed that has to be cancelled due to the pressure on accident and emergency departments in those hospitals that might not be on-call during the night-time hours.</P>

        <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the fact that 400 children with disabilities in residential care are not protected by an inspectorate and that those children are three to seven times more likely to suffer abuse; the immediate action she will take to address same; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[45859/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Children with disabilities who require residential care may be accommodated, depending on their needs, in generic residential centres, under the Child Care Act 1991 or in specialist residential services for children with disabilities.</P>
        <P>A total of 400 children are accommodated in generic children&rsquo;s residential centres, under the Child Care Act 1991.  Those include some children with disabilities whose needs for residential care arise out of the responsibilities of the HSE under the Child Care Act rather than because of their disability.  The centres are subject to statutory inspection.  The Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services in the Health Information and Quality Authority has responsibility for this function.</P>
        <P>The statutory framework which underpins this work is laid out in the Child Care (Placement in Residential Care) Regulations 1995.  In addition, national standards for children&rsquo;s residential centres, set down in 2001, have been in operation and are based on the requirements of legislation, regulation and findings from research.  The standards allow inspectors to form judgments <Col N="793"/>about the quality of services provided in those centres.  Areas covered by standards include child protection and children&rsquo;s rights.  Currently, 227 children are placed in specialist residential centres for children of which 200 children have an intellectual disability and 27 children have a physical and sensory disability.</P>
        <P>All services for children with disabilities are covered by the national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children, Children First, published by the Department of Health and Children.  Residential centres for children with disabilities are required to ensure that there are appropriate policies and procedures in place for the identification, reporting and management of any concerns in regard to abuse of children in those centres.</P>
        <P>In November 2007, the HSE prepared a guidance document that sets out the standards expected from all residential service providers for children with disabilities who are not placed in such settings under the Child Care Act 1991.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House. </i></P>
        <P el="0">The guidance document was prepared by a working group, comprising HSE staff, including an inspector of residential services, service providers and the National Disability Authority.  The guidance document is currently being operated on a non-statutory basis.</P>
        <P>The HSE is currently finalising a framework for the protection of all vulnerable service users, including children.  This framework will include a revised definition of abuse along with standards and guidelines to ensure protection of all vulnerable service users, including children with disabilities.  The proposed framework will be completed in February 2009.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority which was established in May 2007, has responsibility for the development and monitoring of standards.  HIQA has recently undertaken a public consultation on draft national quality standards with regard to residential settings for people with disabilities and is now in the process of finalising the standards and plan to submit them to the HIQA board in early 2009.  These standards are intended for adults.  HIQA has also developed a set of standards for children which has been circulated, for comment, to its national advisory committee on standards.  It is expected the children&rsquo;s standards will be finalised in the new year.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>In deference to my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, I did not wish to encroach on her time but the Minister just made an extraordinary statement.  She has told this House that between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. there are only 20 attendances at the accident and emergency departments of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals in this city.  I find that very difficult to believe.  I would like to see an input into this from the people who are working in those accident and emergency departments.  Before I address the question, however, I want to say that cutting down on accident and emergency departments seems the most cynical move yet to reduce the numbers on trolleys.  There will not be room for the trolleys in the four accident and emergency departments that are left.  It is outrageous. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may address a supplementary on the question that is tabled. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Turning to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, the bottom line is that there are 400 children who remain in institutions that are not subject to any inspection.  The Minister of State has been asked when this glaring deficit will be corrected because, statistically, these children are three to seven times more likely to suffer abuse, given the nature of their disabilities and their inability to report.  I again ask the Minister of State when HIQA standards will be brought in and it is empowered to inspect and protect these children.  We have a duty <Col N="794"/>to them because they are the most vulnerable children in our society.  The standards need to be introduced as soon as possible.  If we can stay here all night and pass laws in relation to banks and guillotine health Bills to take the medical card off the over-70s, surely we can address this issue before Christmas and ensure the safety of these children. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe there is any need for the Deputy to raise the medical card issue again; the House knows his position on that matter.  He should not rehearse all that again, since he changes his position so often.  My position is very definite.  I am making the very direct response to the effect that he should have known this because he attended the committee meeting recently at which HIQA representatives were present.  They made it quite clear that while they are prepared to carry out the inspections, they are waiting on funding from this Department.  The Department, in turn, is working with HIQA to ensure that the initiative will start some time towards the middle of next year.</P>

        <P>Could I attempt, without interruption if at all possible, to avoid a balling match and just make the point that HIQA was quite properly set up by the Minister for Health and Children, recognising as she did the need for a quality authority, for which she has to be complimented?  She made the position quite clear to HIQA regarding the standards that were to be brought in, first of all, for the elderly.  Our priority now is to ensure that the people in such homes are properly supervised.

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest> her views on the financial impact the new private health insurance levy has had on health insurance premiums; if the recently announced price increases will force many young people and families out of the market due to the fact that health insurance has become unaffordable; when she expects to receive the EU Commission decision on the new levy; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[45860/08] </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to a priority question from Deputy Reilly on 25 November, I said that the measures announced by the Government the previous week should not, in themselves, lead to an overall increase in the &euro;1.5 billion in private health insurance premiums paid by all health insurance customers as the new levy on health insurance companies will yield approximately the same amount as the enhanced tax relief for those aged over 50.  However, I emphasised that it would be a commercial decision for individual health insurance companies as to how they chose to reflect the overall impact of the measures in setting their premiums.  Since I last answered questions on this matter, Quinn Healthcare and the VHI have announced price increases for customers taking out or renewing policies from 1 January 2009.  Quinn Healthcare is increasing prices by an average of 16%, VHI&rsquo;s increases average 23%, while Hibernian Healthcare has not announced any increase to date.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the individual companies to explain and justify the levels of the increases they are introducing.  I do not believe the measures announced by the Government have had any significant impact on these decisions.  There are several underlying cost pressures in private health insurance, including medical inflation, the ageing of the insured population, increased numbers of procedures and greater economic pricing of public hospital services to insurers.</P>
        <P>I hope that young people and families do not leave the market.  Health insurance cover in Ireland represents good value for all age groups.  The Government will bring forward the lifetime community rating regulations for enactment in 2009.  These will provide a powerful incentive for people to take out insurance cover earlier in life and to retain it.  Anyone inclined to cancel their insurance now should consider carefully that they may have to pay a higher premium to re-enter the market at a later date.  In introducing the measures announced on 19 November, the Government had to choose between allowing older people to be forced out of <Col N="796"/>the market and trying to maintain the key principle of intergenerational solidarity whereby the young support the old.</P>
        <P>I expect to have a response early in the new year to our notification of the measures to the Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister claims that if she did not take action, VHI premiums would increase by 60% for older people.  This could not happen because we have community rating.  It would have to increase by 60% for everybody.  She claimed that the levy would not lead to any overall increase in the approximately &euro;1.5 billion in private health insurance premiums paid, but she was wrong because VHI premiums have increased by 23% and Quinn Healthcare increased premiums by 16%, while stating baldly that 50% of that rise was accounted for by the levy.  She claimed that certain insurers were tailoring their plans to suit younger people.  So did the VHI, which has dominance in the 20, 30, 40 and 50 year old age group sectors &mdash; as well as in the 60, 70 and 80 age groups.  It dominates the market. </P>
        <P>When will the Minister bring the legislation before the House?  What will she do about the dominance of the VHI in the marketplace?  Will the money raised by the levy be ring-fenced to health insurance, or will it go into the Exchequer &mdash; that is a later question, but it may be taken now?  Is the Minister not concerned about the estimated 200,000 people who are expected to leave private health insurance on foot of the introduction of the health insurance levy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The market was segmenting.  Citizens could see that some plans were geared to couples in their child bearing years, where maternity benefits were being offered and sports injuries were being included as well as teeth whitening.  These products are not of interest to older people, so within a specific plan everybody will have to pay the same rate.  However, the manner in which different products were being covered was leading to market segmentation. </P>
        <P>This is not about protecting any company, but rather older people. The revenue implications of this are neutral.  The money coming in will go back in the form of enhanced tax relief for those aged 50 and over.  Obviously, it will be higher for those aged 60 to 70 and higher again for people older than that.  The reality is that if one company has 320 times more 80 year olds than another, we know that health insurance costs associated with an 80 year old are twice those for a 40 year old &mdash; or a 60 year old will cost twice, on average, what a 30 year old costs.  There is no getting away from that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not believe the Government, in the light of the Supreme Court decision, had any alternative but to advance what we have advanced.  It requires EU approval and I made it clear there would be no point in bringing the legislation before the House if we have either to change it or cannot proceed with it.  As soon as there is a response from the EU, which we expect early in the new year, the intention is to bring the legislation forward if we are in a position to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Many people would reject the Minister&rsquo;s assertion to the effect that she had no option other than to introduce the levy system.  The VHI has considerable funds, made a considerable profit of &euro;112 million last year and has raised its premia by 23%.  Why was the legislative route offered by the courts not taken, which obviously left the door open for the Minister to bring in new legislation that would introduce a new form of risk equalisation?  In the past, I have raised concerns about the level at which risk equalisation was set, given the dominance of the VHI in the market and the fact that with its huge database it no longer has any restriction on it from going into any market.  Is this fattening the calf for sale?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="797"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The market here was liberalised in the mid 1990s and perhaps other decisions could have been made then, but they were not.  At the time, some 37% of the population had health insurance and everybody thought we were at market saturation level.  However, some 53% of people now have health insurance.</P>
        <P>The VHI is required to be authorised during 2009 and must meet the same requirements as its competitors in terms of the reserves required.  It will be a major challenge for the VHI to meet the requirements to allow it be authorised on the same basis.  It is important that better consumer information is provided.  The VHI, like other health insurers, is now required to send out renewal notices to consumers 30 days in advance of renewal and to notify them that they can switch insurers without penalty.  Many members of health insurance companies do not know that.  The provision of such information on motor insurance was very powerful in encouraging people to switch insurers.  Any measures we can introduce to better inform consumers and encourage them to look at the different options, including the products offered by other companies, will be forthcoming from the start of next year.</P>
        <P>With regard to the legislation, we will have it early in the new year when we get the response from the Commission.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the inception of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, OMCYA, a key emphasis has been placed on improving the availability and quality of management information.  Key components of this information management include the annual review of adequacy of children and family services, prepared annually by the HSE under section 8 of the Child Care Act 1991, and the monthly service plan monitoring reports submitted to the Department of Health and Children.  The section 8 reports now include the data previously collected in the analysis of child care interim data set.  The further development of this information strategy is set to continue with the completion and roll-out of the joint OMCYA-HSE knowledge management policy, which has been a key element of recent discussions between myself and senior management in the HSE.</P>
        <P>As regards the specific areas of information mentioned by the Deputy, information currently available in this area of child welfare and protection is collated and submitted as part of the previously mentioned section 8 annual reviews.  Owing to the need to put in place a new reporting structure and methodology to reflect the new unitary structure following the establishment of the HSE, reports in respect of 2005 and 2006 were delayed but have now been published.  I am informed by the HSE that the 2007 report is nearing completion and that thereafter, reports will follow in a timely fashion.  These annual reviews include, <i>inter alia,</i> <Col N="798"/>details of reported child protection cases and outcomes, broken down into each of the four primary, community and continuing care, PCCC, regions.  Under current systems in place in the HSE, there is a time lag in the availability of information requested by the Deputy.  It is imperative that such information be available on demand and for this reason I have requested the HSE to prioritise the necessary development and implementation plans so as to have this information readily available for service delivery and monitoring purposes.</P>
        <P>In addition to this annual report, the HSE National Service Plan 2008 committed the HSE to developing, from the second quarter of 2008, a mechanism for collecting quarterly information from each administrative area on the following indicators: the number of notifications made of child abuse or neglect, the number of assessments conducted following notifications, the number of children on waiting lists for assessments following notification of child abuse or neglect and the average time spent on a waiting list for assessment following notification of child abuse or neglect.</P>
        <P>Reporting against this measure is based on the phased implementation of standardised business process currently taking place through the HSE&rsquo;s child care information system project.  I have been informed by the HSE that the first of the standardised business processes required for reporting against these measures were agreed and piloted during 2008 and will be implemented during 2009.  At a recent meeting with HSE managers I was also informed that the HSE is seeking to provide additional resources to the standardised business process project.  This should enable the HSE to provide my office with timely information relating to all of the areas mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State confirm that the information on which his Department relies for an overview of child protection services is, essentially, the information contained in the 2006 report, which was only published last October?  Does he agree it is an understatement to say there is a time lag in information and that it is scandalously unacceptable that the report for 2007 has not yet been published, two and a half weeks before we enter 2009?  Will the Minister of State confirm that as Minister with responsibility for children he does not know how many files are currently on the shelves of offices of the HSE, detailing reports of children at risk of abuse or neglect, due to be allocated for full assessment to a social worker but which have not yet been allocated?  Will he confirm there are many hundreds of such cases?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I came into this office, the 2005 and 2006 figures have been received.  I have also received information on the 2007 interim data set and the section 8 reports arising from it.  I have a commitment from the HSE that it will have the information published before the end of this year, which means the next few days.  Furthermore, the HSE has committed to having the 2008 figures by April or May of 2009.  The time lag referred to in my earlier response is a legacy or carryover from the old health boards and the difficulty presented in gathering the information.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We are moving towards a knowledge management strategy so we can standardise issues such as referrals and so we can, at any time, provide ourselves with an X-ray of what is happening on a contemporaneous basis, rather than having to hang around to collate the figures as we have done for so long.  Therefore, we are making incremental progress on the issue, but I do not claim it is perfect.  We do not have the up-to-date figures I would like to have, but over the past six months I have met the HSE on a monthly basis.  One of the key issues has been to get on top of this issue so that we will be able to make proper assessments of where gaps and duplications exist in order to apply resources properly in this important area.</P>

	<P>Would the Minister of State agree that for the eleven and a half years of Fianna F&aacute;il in Government we have had a Minister with responsibility for children?  Would he agree it is outrageous and scandalous that four years after the formation of the HSE he, who is supposed to have an overview of our children&rsquo;s services, is as he put it hanging around to find out how it is operating and cannot tell the House definitively how many cases of children reported to be at risk are currently awaiting full assessment by the HSE?  Does he agree he is incapable of monitoring what is happening in our child protection services?</P>
        <P>Can the Minister of State explain what happened to the child protection notification system, which was supposed to have been put in place some years ago and in respect of which there were various IT difficulties?  What was the cost of that system?  What were the IT difficulties?  What work has been done to get the system up and running.  By what definite date will the Department have any guaranteed contemporaneous information available to it on the working of our child protection services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I have information from the HSE service plan in terms of its monthly monitoring reports, the latest of which is for October 2008.  Obviously, the information that comes with the section 8 reports is more detailed and focused on the specifics.  With regard to the IT projects, we are making significant progress.  There are different IT systems in different areas, again a legacy and hangover from the health boards.</P>

	<P>We are making significant progress on this and hope, in the HSE service plan for 2009, to ensure it is a priority and that we can deliver it.  With regard to contemporaneous delivery and when it will happen, we already piloted the standardisation of the business process and therefore we will know the initial referral figures and the assessment figures at the same time.  We undertook to do that through the service plan.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 77 and 80 together.</P>
        <P>In designing the package of measures announced on 19 November the Government considered several options and consulted widely.  I consulted with the Health Insurance Authority, which has a statutory duty to provide me with advice on the private health insurance industry.  In addition, either I or my officials met with each of the three existing insurers in the market before these measures were announced.  Given that there is no consensus in the industry on how the differential cost profiles of the customers of the companies can be reconciled to underpin community rating, the Government ultimately had to take the decision on what needed to be done to protect the interests of older people and to ensure they could continue to afford good quality health insurance cover.  Meetings have been held with the three major insurers in recent weeks.  There will be continuing contact with the companies on administrative arrangements for the implementation of the measures.</P>
        <P>In themselves, the measures should not lead to an overall increase in the &euro;1.5 billion in private health insurance premiums paid by all consumers because the new levy on health insurance companies will yield approximately the same amount as the enhanced tax relief for those aged over 50.  However, I emphasised that it would be a commercial decision for individual health insurance companies as to how they chose to reflect the overall impact of the measures in setting their premiums.  I wish to make it clear that the levy is not being imposed <Col N="801"/>on the individual policy holder but on the companies.  It is a commercial decision for each company whether they pass on any or all of the levy to their customers.</P>
        <P>Since I last answered questions on this matter, Quinn Healthcare and the VHI announced price increases for customers taking out or renewing policies from 1 January 2009.  Quinn Healthcare is increasing prices by an average of 16%.  The VHI increases average 23%.  Hibernian Healthcare has not announced any increase to date.  It is a matter for the individual companies to explain and justify the levels of the increases they are introducing.  There are several underlying cost pressures in private health insurance, including medical inflation, the ageing of the insured population, increased numbers of procedures, and greater economic pricing of public hospital services to insurers.</P>
        <P>I hope that young people and families will not leave the market.  Health insurance cover in Ireland represents good value for all age groups.  The Government will bring forward the lifetime community rating regulations for enactment in early 2009.  These will provide a powerful incentive for people to take out insurance cover earlier in life and to retain it.  Anyone inclined to cancel their insurance now should consider carefully that they may have to pay a higher premium in order to re-enter the market at a later date.</P>
        <P>While the amount raised in the levy on companies is intended to equal the cost of the age-related tax reliefs, the moneys collected from the levy will not be ring-fenced because the two measures are being introduced by amendments to two different pieces of legislation.  It is a long-standing convention in our tax code that we do not have hypothecated taxes which are raised and ring-fenced for specific purposes.  The moneys raised from the levy will accrue to general Exchequer funds and, likewise, the cost of the new age-related tax reliefs will be met from general Exchequer funds.  In designing these measures, the Minister for Finance and I made it clear that the combined effect of these measures on the Exchequer, should, as far as is practicable, be neutral.  I expect that the amending legislation will be published in the new year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister makes the assumption that this measure will be budget neutral but many have calculated that as much as &euro;15 million will accrue to the Exchequer as a consequence of this levy.  In that circumstance, and in a year when we cannot vaccinate our young women against cervical cancer at a cost of &euro;10 million, I hoped that this money, at least, might have been ring-fenced for health services rather than have it go back into the Exchequer.  Can the Minister tell the House why it is not possible to ring-fence this money?  If the money becomes available why can the Minister not give a commitment to the House that it will be used to bring in the cervical vaccination programme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention in this proposal is not to raise revenue but, by way of a levy, to supplement the higher cost of insuring older people through an enhanced tax relief.  The matter of ring-fencing any moneys would be a matter for the Minister for Finance.  As anybody who has been in Government will know, this policy has never been pursued by any Minister for Finance.  A proportion from the money raised from the consumption of tobacco goes to the health service but that is an exception.</P>
        <P>I have no control over the moneys that go to Revenue.  The health service gets its funding from the Minister for Finance, through the Department and onwards to the Health Service Executive or other funded organisations.  Deputy Reilly suggests that, because young people exit the insurance market, this policy was pursued on the basis of advice from the Health Insurance Authority and from our actuarial advisors.  The Department of Finance and my own officials were heavily involved.  We estimate that the proposed levy will be equal to the amount of money that will be given by way of enhanced tax relief.  The total sum is within the pool of <Col N="802"/>those insured.  In other words, what is raised by the levy goes back in tax relief.  That is the intention.  If it were the case that any surplus were to arise, clearly that would be dealt with in a different context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If it is intended that this measure be budget neutral then it would make sense to ring-fence it.  I do not understand why this could not be done.</P>
        <P>Have the insurers, VHI and Quinn Healthcare, told the Minister why they increased their premia to such an extent?  Is the Minister concerned that more people will now use the public service because of the increases?  The measure combines with job losses that have already taken place and others likely to happen next year.  Are there any contingency plans for that?  People cannot afford health insurance any longer.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that there would be something in the new legislation by way of an incentive for younger people to take out insurance.  Will she elaborate on that point?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of groups that looked at the private health insurance market in Ireland, including all the companies in the market, suggested to me that there should be an incentive for people to begin their insurance when they are young in order to keep insurance affordable for older people.  Relatively few people under the age of 35 use insurance.  At a committee meeting recently I mentioned that I am aware of a company that has over 2,000 insured employees.  I was told there was not a single claim last year because these are all very young people.</P>
        <P>We are going to introduce what is termed &ldquo;lifetime community rating&rdquo; and we will do so by way of regulations that are currently being drafted.  We do not require separate legislation for that.  Essentially, the younger one joins, the cheaper the policy will be.  There will be a cost disincentive the older one is joining the health insurance market.  That is fair and everybody has recommended it.</P>
        <P>With regard to job losses, there is no doubt the increase in health insurance in Ireland between 1996 and 2008 of approximately 14% has been accounted for, in the main, by our increased prosperity and more people in the work force.  Some have their health insurance paid as part of their employment contract.  There is no doubt about that and there has been a considerable increase in numbers insured, particularly in the Deputy&rsquo;s area of the mid-west.  I understand that region has the highest rate of young people insured in the country.  That was the case a year or so ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not be the case next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it will be.  Clearly, if there is a decline in our economic circumstances this may will impact on the situation.</P>
        <P>With regard to the reasons why the insurance was increased, Quinn Healthcare said that half the increase was due to the levy.  I will be honest about that.  The company said as much in its public statement.  We have in the budget again hugely increased the cost of private beds in public hospitals because I do not believe, nor do I think it sustainable, that public hospitals funded 100% by the taxpayers should offer preferential access to those who have private health insurance.  We are trying each year to increase this cost substantially until we get to a situation where the economic cost is charged to the insurers for those private beds and the taxpayers and the public hospitals do not suffer the expense of staffing of those beds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minster indicate if either her Department or the HSE are currently monitoring the effect of growing unemployment on health funding?  I have <Col N="803"/>no doubt she would be in a position to confirm there is an increase in the number of people applying for a medical card.  Will she also confirm there is a decrease in the number of people taking out private health insurance?  Is she aware if a pattern is already presenting where people are allowing private health insurance they have held for a period of time, perhaps years in some cases, to lapse?  Is this information available to the Minister?  Does she accept, as this Deputy does, that growing unemployment and the increased cost of private health insurance will have a significant impact as both escalate in their respective ways?</P>
        <P>In light of this, does the Minister accept that the appropriate response with regard to a growing dependency on the public health system is for all public moneys to be invested in the public health delivery system itself and not, as is the case currently, in having public moneys diverted to the private, for-profit health providers?  Does she accept that her signing off on the HSE service plan for 2009 represents a failure to grasp this very simple message and that, instead of squandering public moneys, we should be guaranteeing the continuation of the best quality public service system that this State and our people can afford?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to private health insurance, the VHI was established 51 years ago, when I was not around, because it was felt there were people who would make a contribution towards the cost of their own health care.  It is a policy I support.  Regardless of whether we had a universal system of health insurance, and no such system has been introduced since the Second World War in any European country, there will always be people who will buy more &mdash; I have no doubt about that.</P>
        <P>We must be pragmatic.  We have a mixed system.  When I am sometimes asked to explain it to ministerial colleagues in Europe, they are often confused about how one can have private health insurance which gives one service in a public hospital.  It is rather confusing but it is a different system.  We have to be pragmatic in the way in which we use taxpayers&rsquo; money to procure treatments.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which now has a budget of just over &euro;100 million, is to use the spare capacity in the private sector to buy treatments for patients.  I accept it is restricted to those treatments that are procedure-based, although they have done some fantastic work in regard to some outpatient appointments.  We must continue to use whatever mechanisms and innovation we can to access treatment for patients.  In my experience, the patients do not care how it is funded.  What they care about is the quality of the treatment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister committed herself to ring-fencing funds for the psychiatric service in regard to the sale of lands owned by the HSE.  Is she not being inconsistent in stating she does not have the authority to do so in this respect?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I am not the Minister for Finance and I do not have any authority over the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

	<P>The Minister committed herself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have responsibility for health and, clearly, in the context of health budgets, we can give directions to the HSE.  I do not have such authority with regard to the Revenue Commissioners, except to note that the intention is that the subsidy will go to enhance the tax benefit for older people.  This is not introduced as a revenue raising measure but simply to make and keep health insurance affordable for those over 50, particularly those over 70 and 80.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I was surprised to see the Minister for Finance announce at the weekend that the Government was not aware of the extent of the economic tsunami coming to our shores until July, after which its members went away on their holidays.  I had thought the budget being brought forward by a number of weeks was the economic plan for survival for the country&rsquo;s economy and the road to the future for economic recovery and the protection and creation of jobs.  The fact of the matter is that since then the Government has demonstrated it is rudderless and leaderless, and has neither coherence nor competence.  In fact, the Minister&rsquo;s declaration was nothing other than a declaration of unfitness for office and unfitness to serve, <Col N="805"/>and it particularly pointed at the Taoiseach himself in that he was Minister for Finance for a number of years before taking up his present position.</P>
        <P>For 11 weeks since the D&aacute;il passed the deposit guarantee legislation, we have waited for a decision in regard to recapitalisation of the banks and we have simply pointed out that businesses are in serious difficulty, there is no access to credit, overdrafts are being squeezed and 35,000 people have lost their jobs since that legislation was put through.  At 8.45 p.m. on Sunday, an announcement was made not of action but of inaction with regard to the provision of &euro;10 billion for recapitalisation of banks.  The statement was vague, unconvincing and had neither specifics nor a strategic plan attached to it.  It has failed to reassure anyone that the Government has a coherent plan to stabilise the banking system so that credit can continue to be provided for small businesses throughout the country.</P>
        <P>As the Minister was unable to answer any question comprehensively on Sunday night about the Government decision taken on Sunday, will the Taoiseach clear up the confusion by answering a number of questions in this regard?  First, when will the Government provide this &euro;10 billion fund for recapitalisation of the banks?  Second, what amount of money is to be provided by the Government from the National Pensions Reserve Fund either as preference shares or ordinary shares, or is any to be provided from that source?  If that is the case, when does the Government propose to introduce the change in the legislation which will be required to get authorisation from the House to provide money from that source?</P>
        <P>Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to force or pressurise the banks so that, for example, by the end of January they will demonstrate they have internationally accepted levels of capital adequacy ratios available?  Is it his intention to tell the banks it is not just the case that if the banks want to recapitalise, it is at their own discretion?  If we are serious about protecting jobs that are now under serious threat, and about maintaining the economy throughout the country then, given that the Government is deep into the banking sector, as the Minister for Finance has said, it is in a position to exert leverage on the banks in a way that will guarantee that if the Government allocates money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, it will actually flow as credit when required, particularly to small businesses to keep them alive.  Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to seek an assurance from the banks by the end of January that there will be an adequate, internationally accepted capital ratio in place?  How does the Taoiseach intend to proceed following the vague announcement made on Sunday night?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to point out that the covered institutions meet the capital adequacy ratios set out under regulatory requirements.  In a statement on 28 November last, the Minister for Finance indicated his position and that he was prepared to supplement and encourage private investment in the recapitalisation of credit institutions in Ireland with State participation.  On Sunday in a further positive signal to the market, the Government decided either through the National Pensions Reserve Fund or otherwise, and subject to terms and conditions, to support existing shareholders and private investors where appropriate with a recapitalisation programme for credit institutions in Ireland of up to &euro;10 billion.  We released a statement on Sunday evening setting out the main principles that would guide us in our approach to recapitalisation of the banking system.</P>
        <P>The statement also made clear that the next step was for the Minister for Finance to initiate detailed engagement with the credit institutions in respect of specific proposals.  Institutions have been asked to submit their proposals by early January.  In the context of a commercial transaction, it would not be appropriate or sensible for the Government to pre-empt the detailed and technical issues that might arise in respect of the design and execution of any recapitalisation of any particular institution.  It would certainly not be consistent with ensuring the Government secured the best possible outcome for the State from such a deal.  Based on <Col N="806"/>the statements of last Sunday we will move this dossier along as we have indicated.  We sent a positive signal to the markets concerning the level of contribution and supplementation that the Government is prepared to make in respect of this issue.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that covered institutions meet capital adequacy ratios.  There is a perception in the markets internationally of the need for banking institutions to further recapitalise in addition to meeting capital adequacy ratios.  It was in that context that we wanted to send a positive signal to the markets.  This matter must be taken in the way we have set out.</P>
        <P>I refer to the question of the lending criteria of banks.  The whole purpose of recapitalisation in the banking sector is to ensure that the real economy is provided with the maximum amount of lending possible in current circumstances.  The banks appeared before a committee of the House this morning and outlined their position in detail on this matter.  We continue to seek the provision of business plans from the banks as a means of ensuring transparently that they will maximise lending to the small and medium enterprise sector and the Minister for Finance maintains this view.  Should recapitalisation take place we will see further confirmation of that fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The reply does not deal with many of the questions asked.  The Taoiseach previously said that moneys would only be provided as a last resort, but now says money may be made available from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, or otherwise.  What does that mean?  Do the plans involve venture capitalists from abroad or other sources of private equity?  My understanding was that business plans should have been provided to the Government following the detailed discussions with the banks.  The statement on Sunday merely buys time for the Government to the extent of several weeks.  We do not yet know of the specific date when the Government intends to implement this plan.  Credit is going down the tubes and 35,000 jobs have been lost.  I can see from travelling throughout the country that the keys of business premises will be thrown back at banks by the end of January and February.</P>
        <P>My call for a recapitalisation of the banks several weeks ago was based on genuine concern.  If it was genuine concern then it is a good deal more serious now.  The Government requires the authorisation of the House to take money from the National Pension Reserve Fund for recapitalisation.  When does the Government propose to introduce that legislation?  Will it be this week or when the D&aacute;il resumes following Christmas?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance said one could not expect the people who led us into this mess to lead us back out of it.  The same applies to the Government, because it was the Minister for Finance who said the reason we are in this mess is that this is where the people wanted us to go and that the housing boom was based on low interest rates from the European Central Bank.  Will the Taoiseach comment on this and on whether the Government intends to set new capital ratios for the banks?</P>
        <P>Another essential element of economic recovery is managing the national pay awards.  I am at a loss to understand the Government position on this matter.  Although other Ministers said this agreement would be paid, the Minister for Health and Children said on Sunday night that money would not be provided for the Health Service Executive next year.  Do I take it from the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s statement to the nation that the revised health programme, approved by her, is predicated on the basis that there is no money for that revised programme in the HSE budget?  I remind the Taoiseach of his comments to the effect that money was not provided for the national pay awards for the HSE next year.  Will the Taoiseach confirm who is telling the truth?  Is it the Minister for Health and Children or the other Ministers?  What is the position regarding her statement on Sunday night?  Will the national pay deal proceed or not?  I have publicly given my view on this matter.  The Taoiseach said he issued a statement <Col N="807"/>saying the matter would be discussed with the unions, but later the same night another statement was issued stating something else.  What is the position?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me say with respect to the public pay situation that the Government indicated in the budget the need for savings of 4% in payroll costs in all Departments.  That is Government policy.  The public pay deal contains an 11 month pay pause.  In respect of a payment to be made in October of next year of 3.5%, annualised that is about a 1.1% pay increase next year.  Regarding the social partnership process, taking into account all expenditure programmes and all Government expenditure to see how we can deal with the deteriorating public finance position is a matter in which the social partners will be involved in the coming weeks.  I have refused to isolate the pay issue from all other issues.  All expenditure must be examined in that context.  We have already made provision through proposed expenditure savings of 4% in respect of pay costs for 2009 as part of the budgetary strategy.  There is no change in that position and the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s comments in no way change that position.</P>
        <P>I refer to the question on the recapitalisation of the banks.  The capital adequacy ratios are set by regulators and by reference to international practice.  The issue which has arisen for financial institutions is the need to examine recapitalisation not as a means of providing more working capital, but more capital for banks.  That is the perception of the markets.  Therefore, in an effort to assist the Irish banking system and maintain its stability, we have specifically indicated how we see recapitalisation taking place.  It will be on the basis of further engagement between the Minister for Finance and the covered institutions.  The response of the markets to this was helpful in that it indicated the direction in which the Government was thinking and this will continue to be its position in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Part of Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question related to the present state of the Irish economy, which, being one of the most open economies in the world, is affected by what is going on globally.  A global recovery will be needed to effect an Irish recovery.  Having listened to the European Union Heads of State and Government, all have seen a serious deterioration in their public finance positions.  Ireland&rsquo;s has been particularly acute because an international recession has concurred with a downturn in the construction sector and other sectors of the economy to the point where it is in recession.  While Ireland is not unique in this regard, we have a particular situation to resolve.</P>
        <P>As for the question in respect of what Deputy Kenny considers to be the additional resources that came about on foot of the increased employment and activity arising from construction, between two thirds and 70% of that money went towards the reduction of the national debt.  Consequently, the idea it was all used for day-to-day expenditure is incorrect.  Some of it certainly was used to improve services, in improved capital expenditure and towards improving some of our day-to-day services.  Why would the Government not do so?  Was this not required given an historic under-investment in a range of such areas?</P>
        <P>The level and speed of deterioration in our present position is such that we will be obliged to seek to address all those issues on the basis of a social partnership engagement that now will take place.  If one seeks the emergence of a successful strategy, it is important to do so.  It is not a question of the Government outsourcing its responsibilities but of the Government working with stakeholders in this society to find the necessary solutions to close the gap that has emerged because of the fall in Ireland&rsquo;s tax revenues in 2008 of up to 15%.  This is the position.  The level of reduction in tax revenues and the impact it is having on public finances is not unique to Ireland.  We have particular issues and must deal with our own problems.  While we do not take solace from the problems of others, it is up to us to deal with our problems in our own way through the established processes.  I believe social partnership is a <Col N="808"/>problem-solving, not a problem avoidance, process.  This has proven to be the case in the past and I believe in it.  I believe it is the way to do the job.</P>
        <P>As for the recapitalisation of the banks, that is a policy issue with which the Government has continued to deal in a consistent manner since it brought forward the guarantee scheme.  Suggestions were made from the Opposition side of the House immediately thereafter to the effect that such a measure would enhance working capital.  However, it does not as it simply increases capital adequacy in the bank.  When one puts more capital into a bank, it does not come out the other side in the following weeks as working capital to Irish businesses, although that contention appears to have been made.  The Government must address the market perception that capital adequacy ratios in banks must be sufficient in present circumstances, which is the reason for the decision it brought forward on Sunday.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened carefully to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply to Deputy Kenny and, when taken with his replies to questions on the economic situation in the past couple of weeks, I have come to the conclusion that the Taoiseach and the Government do not know what they are doing regarding the banks.  The Government&rsquo;s handling of the economic situation is downright incompetent at this stage.  Since the Taoiseach last answered Leaders&rsquo; Questions in this House last Wednesday, there has been a succession of extraordinary developments in respect of the economy.  The Minister for Finance told Deputy Joan Burton in the House last Thursday that the economy would shrink by 4% next year.  In an interview with Ursula Halligan last Friday night, the Minister stated that the first the Government knew of the economic downturn was in July.  However, people have been losing their jobs and businesses have been closing for the past year.  Moreover, at the weekend commentators suggested that unemployment will rise above 300,000, or 10%, next year and that 14,000 householders are three months or more behind with their mortgage repayments at present.</P>
        <P>Members have learned in the past couple of days that the Government intends to draw up an economic recovery plan.  Two weeks ago, the Taoiseach told me in the House there was no need for such a plan, as the Government already had one, which was called the national development plan.  I now hear that proposals are being developed, some of which ring familiar.  They are close to what has been proposed by the Labour Party for a number of months and to what Deputy Burton and I were discussing at the Labour Party conference in Kilkenny two weeks ago.  While plagiarism is a form of flattery, I wish to see the exact colour of the Government&rsquo;s proposals.</P>
        <P>On Sunday night, a &euro;10 billion package to recapitalise the banks was announced.  The Taoiseach has told Members that this recapitalisation will not take place until January and that the Government is waiting for the bankers to come in with their proposals.  Who is calling the shots?  Is it the same bankers who landed the banking system in the problem that manifested itself in September and has continued thereafter, or is it the Government?  I had thought that one of the outcomes of the guarantee scheme was to be that it would be the Government, through the Minister for Finance, that would tell the banks what was what and not the other way around.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach now has told Members that the recapitalisation of the banks must await some proposals from the same bankers who still are in place.  They have changed nothing, it is <Col N="809"/>business as usual and they will tell the Government what to do.  Moreover, this will not take place until January.  Will all the banks still be around next January?  Can this wait until then?  My understanding is that legislation will be required if the Government intends to use money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  However, it is proposed that the D&aacute;il will not reconvene in Leinster House until the end of January.  Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that Members will close up shop on Thursday and that the issue of bank recapitalisation will not be addressed until the end of January?  That is the effect of what he proposes to do, if he intends to use the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach should answer a couple of simple questions.  First, how much, in ballpark figures, of the proposed &euro;10 billion will be drawn from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and how much from private funds?  Has the Government identified the source of the private funding that will recapitalise the banks?  Will the Government take equity in the banks or is an underwritten arrangement envisaged, as seemed to be implied in the statement?  When will legislation to allow money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to be used be brought before the House?  The Taoiseach observed that the statement issued on Sunday night was to provide reassurance to the markets.  Given the markets&rsquo; response since Sunday night, does he seriously suggest this can wait until January or will some action be taken this side of Christmas that will stabilise our banking system and ensure that credit is released for businesses that are uncertain whether they still will be in business by the first week of January?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I will answer the Deputy on the economy.  It is not true to say &mdash; nor did the Minister for Finance say despite the Deputy&rsquo;s attempts to portray him as so saying &mdash; that people were unaware of the overall state of the international economy until this June.  The Minister was referring to the mid-term Exchequer returns.  On the emergence of these returns, the Government took action to ensure that expenditure would come in on target this year, as it has in broad measure.  The full year effect of the cuts that were outlined will mean a saving of &euro;1 billion in 2009.  While the Government brought forward its budget to close the gap again, there has been a deterioration in the public finance position since then.  I stated that any programme of Government is subject to the health of the public finances.  There always is such a paragraph that must inform any programme for Government as to how one can implement the priorities one identifies.  That was simply the point I was making in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s present position is that in the context of trying to give an impression of what the direction of the economy should be in the years ahead, it will set out a framework about economic renewal, which must involve social partnership participation.  That is my response.  We must involve social partners in ensuring the gap which has emerged on foot of reduced tax revenues of &euro;8 billion this year will be addressed.  If we are to set up a credible timeframe in which it can be addressed, when set against the expenditure items on our books, we must work out together, in a collaborative way, how to bring back health to the public finance position.  I speak as someone who believes in social partnership.  Others believe it should be done in some other fashion but this is how I believe it should be done.  I am sticking by that methodology because I believe this is the way to do it.  We will do this in the coming weeks and in the early part of next year with the social partners.</P>
        <P>On the question of recapitalisation, the National Pensions Reserve Fund can participate through the significant cash reserves it has to hand.  There is also the question of amending the fund in the context of not having a pre-1% payment into the fund next year on account of the financial situation and as we put the fund to work in the Irish economy with the real prospect of getting a return for our money.  That is what we intend to do.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore asked about the nature of the recapitalisation.  That may vary from institution to institution, but he can take it as read that the purpose of any recapitalisation in terms <Col N="810"/>of participation by the State of taxpayers&rsquo; money will be for the purpose of protecting the taxpayers&rsquo; money.  That, and ensuring that we have recourse to those funds in the future on a convertible basis or whatever.  Those details will be worked out with each institution and it will be a matter that would have to be accepted by the regulator and by shareholders in that context.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are taking this on a case-by-case basis.  We are indicating what the total provision should be.  It will total &euro;10 billion.  The extent of the State provision will depend on what comes forward and we will be making sure that the taxpayers&rsquo; interests are protected.  To elaborate any further at this stage, before the banks submit their proposals, would not protect the taxpayers&rsquo; interest.  That is the course of action we are taking on the question of the recapitalisation of the banks.  It is the right approach to take.</P>
        <P>With regard to the overall economic situation, we intend bringing forward a pathway on how we deal with the gap in the public finances over a credible timeframe with social partnership collaboration and participation.  I make no apologies for that approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer I am none the wiser about what the Government is going to do about recapitalising the banks.  The answer is more or less a repetition of the statement on Sunday night.</P>
        <P>I ask the Taoiseach to outline the timetable.  He spoke about the banks coming back with their proposals in early January.  Everybody is aware, at least in general terms, of the current state of individual banks.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated that he would be dealing with matters on a case-by-case basis.  Is he saying that they will not be fully addressed until the end of January?  Will it require legislation?  Do I understand from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply that the amount which will be taken from the National Pensions Reserve Fund will be approximately &euro;4 billion which, I understand, is what the cash reserves amount to?  Can that be done without legislation?  If there is to be legislation, when will it be published and considered by this House?</P>
        <P>What is the form of the State involvement in this?  A menu was set out in the statement on Sunday night which included the possibilities of share options but also referred to some form of underwriting.  How will the State involvement be provided?  Will it be provided in the same or a different way to all institutions?</P>
        <P>Has the Taoiseach identified the source or sources of the private investment in the banks?  What we have at present is a general statement of intent from the Government, but it is a case of live bank and get grass.  We need to hear some specifics from the Government.  I understand why the statement on Sunday night was made but it does not seem to have had the desired impact on the markets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with Deputy Gilmore in respect of this.  The question of the health of a bank is not dictated solely by its price in the equity markets.  Every bank in the world has seen its share price reduce considerably, and it has been very considerable in Ireland.  I accept that.  That is because of some of the exposures that the market perceives.</P>
        <P>However, that is not the point.  The important issue concerns bank capital and to what extent is it capable of providing an adequate ratio in respect of future impaired loans that may arise.  The market perception of a bank or financial institution is that it would like to see it operating above the regulatory standards.  It is in that context &mdash; to deal with that market perception &mdash; that we have brought forward a general policy statement on recapitalisation.</P>
        <P>We will deal with each recapitalisation when we see the proposals.  Some banks have suggested they do not have any requirement for recapitalisation.</P>

	<P>Does anybody know?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Others suggest otherwise.</P>
        <P>However, in recent weeks the Minister for Finance has met a number of banks and investment businesses regarding investment matters in Irish banks.  All propositions were, of course, referred on to the institutions themselves.  The Minister is also aware that some existing shareholders have expressed an interest in subscribing for new capital and the Government has indicated that in principle, existing shareholders will be expected to have the right to subscribe for new capital on the same terms as the Government.  The question of how a recapitalisation will proceed will depend on the proposals that we obtain.</P>

	<P>Is the market perception wrong?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The market perception changes from day to day.  It is not the issue for us.  The issue for us is the health and stability of our financial system, regardless of what the market says.  Our job is to maintain the stability in the financial system, and that is our sole concern.  I am not in the business of playing or working the markets.  The markets will go up and down depending on how they see things from one day to the next, usually fed on rumour, perception and many other issues.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The banks are undercapitalised because of the market perception.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not my job.  My job is to keep stability in the financial system.  In that regard we are making a recapitalisation scheme available that will include existing shareholders, perhaps prospective private investors and the State.</P>
        <P>The recapitalisation proposals will come from the boards of those banks.  We are prepared to participate in a recapitalisation in the interests of keeping a stable financial system so that the real economy &mdash; trying to maintain jobs and investment &mdash; can function as a result of having a stable system.  It is not for the purpose of dealing with the banks, as banks.  It is because, in a modern economy like this one, we need to have access to sufficient lending and commercial credit as is required.  We therefore need to ensure, as part of that response, there are properly capitalised institutions.</P>
        <P>The market has a view on this but, in terms of regulatory positions &mdash; the regulatory issue, which is the legal issue &mdash; there is sufficient capital adequacy ratios in our covered institutions.  That, in case it is lost somewhere, is an important point to make in the context of this discussion.  We are prepared to participate on certain terms and conditions, which will be established by the Government when it sees specific proposals come forward by those banks which wish to have recapitalisation schemes dealt with.</P>
        <P>The question of whether there is an underwriting process or preference or ordinary share capital will be decided when we get proposals in early January.  With regard to the cash reserves held by the National Pensions Reserve Fund, there is cash under the NTMA general aegis that is available to us.</P>

People cannot expect us to speculate on what the proposals will be but let us be clear that the statement we put forward has been accepted as the policy position of the Government.  We await particular proposals and when they are made we will deal with them on the basis of protecting the taxpayer, not on what the markets speculate.</P>

The jobs announced yesterday for Ennis by the US-based Microsemi company as a result of the availability of a daily direct transatlantic service points to the vital role played by access in attracting foreign direct investment.  Aer Lingus&rsquo;s cost base at Shannon Airport has reduced significantly as a result of the forward thinking sacrifices of its staff at the airport and, coupled with the recent announcement of a reduction in the fuel surcharge, this is an excellent opportunity for the Minister to put forward the case for reinstating this service.</P>

        <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 8, 9, 10 and 11 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 23 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 60 minutes by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; in the event that a division is in progress at the time fixed for taking Private Members&rsquo; business, which shall be No. 61, motion re housing, the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted after Private Members&rsquo; time, which shall be taken for 90 minutes tonight, and Standing Order 117(3) shall not apply; and parliamentary questions next for answer by the Taoiseach on EU matters shall be taken on the same day as the statements on EU Council meeting, Brussels, scheduled to be taken on Wednesday, 17 December 2008, and shall be moved to be taken first as ordinary oral questions to the Taoiseach on that day.</P>

	<P>There are four proposals to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for Nos. 8, 9, 10 and 11 to be taken without debate agreed to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to fall into the annual practice of saying: &ldquo;Do not go on holidays for a certain period.&rdquo;  The proposal from the Government is that the D&aacute;il will return at the end of January.  The most important concerns in the country at present are protecting jobs and creating and sustaining employment.  We need to consider the statements by the Government on the recapitalisation of the banks and its economic plan.  I do not expect the <Col N="814"/>Taoiseach to make time for these matters today but I suggest that the House should sit either this Friday or next Tuesday to deal with them.</P>
        <P>A sizeable chunk of the money invested by taxpayers in the National Pensions Reserve Fund will be made available to the banking system.  I am not sure whether it is in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s head to come back with a plan and seek legal authority from the D&aacute;il or if he would prefer to put through legislation and then apply conditions when the Government and the banks are in agreement on the system of recapitalisation to be implemented.  While I do not wish to object to the Order of Business, I would like the Taoiseach to indicate whether we can have a substantive discussion on this matter on Friday or next Tuesday.</P>
        <P>It is wrong to adjourn the House on Thursday and not return until the closing days of January.  In the meantime, the Government will have made its decision after consulting the banks on how it should proceed with recapitalisation.  The matter is very serious and real concerns are being expressed by employers and employees.  Local economies throughout the country have been affected.  It would be wrong of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to retire for six weeks rather than deal with a matter as consequential as this.  I make these observations in respect of the first proposal put by the Ceann Comhairle and ask the Taoiseach to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I find the earlier comments made by the Taoiseach to be incomplete.  I want to know whether the Government plans to provide time for a debate between now and the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s adjournment on Thursday if the Government decides not to introduce the necessary legislation in respect of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Despite everything he has said about the banks, he failed to mention the elephant in the room, namely, the issue of the bad debts carried by the banks.  It is not that the banks lack capital but that when they write off those bad debts the hole in their capital will be as big as the hole that sunk the Titanic.  That is the essence of the matter.  It may only affect some banks in terms of the covered institutions but how can the Taoiseach propose to send the D&aacute;il on a recess for six weeks and not allow a debate when matters will be addressed which deal with the lifeblood of this economy, the jobs of tens of thousands of people and the survival of thousands of businesses in the difficult period after Christmas?</P>
        <P>It is simply unbelievable that the Taoiseach would send a statement to the newspapers which would do justice to the Sphinx it is so vague.  He spoke about preference shares, ordinary shares and underwriting.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not prepared to accept the Order of Business as presented.  We are following on from ministerial questions to the Minister for Health and Children, during which she indicated the service plan for 2009 for the HSE had been laid before the House and was on the green Order Paper for today&rsquo;s business.  It is on the green Order Paper but up to a short time before the commencement of this Order of Business and following the Minister having indicated to the House that the service plan had been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, it was not available in the Oireachtas Library to Members.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister to produce the service plan for the HSE, wherein, we understand, she has signed off&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is pertinent to the very question the Ceann Comhairle is asking us to accept.  No. 8 is a motion on the sitting to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the first sitting of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Nobody here should forget that in the Democratic Programme for the First D&aacute;il, the commitment was there to safeguard the health of the people.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>And not to murder them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Yet we have a position where we are being asked to accept an Order Paper that does not even accommodate or address in excess of &euro;500 million in proposed cuts in health services over the coming 12 months.  It is simply and absolutely unacceptable on top of all of the other cuts and continuous haemorrhage of services that we have witnessed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Taoiseach to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;throughout this year.  This Order Paper fails to address the most important issue of concern to the Irish people today and it must be rejected.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The committees will return to the House on 7 January and be ongoing with their work.  International trade missions will also be conducted by Ministers in an effort to <Col N="816"/>secure and maintain jobs and keep markets open for products and services which are fundamental to the State.</P>
        <P>A special sitting of the House is being suggested to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the First D&aacute;il which will be in the Mansion House on 20 January.  I look forward to it as it is an historic occasion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It certainly is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it will be a dignified occasion to which we can all rise.  I look forward to contributing on that day.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to reopen issues that have been dealt with already in Leaders&rsquo; Questions but on the whole question of underwriting, EGMs, share issues or prospectuses having to be drawn up, there is a range of issues that must be dealt with under company law before that comes about.  The idea that it will all happen over Christmas is not the full picture of the procedures in the event of a recapitalisation taking place in the banks and how State participation in such an event would proceed.</P>
        <P>It does not add justified confidence to the system on the regulatory position where there are capital adequacy ratios that are sufficient to make contentions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is not correct, in an effort to maintain financial stability, to state this is not the case.  We should stick to the regulatory arrangements as they are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Why are the shares at 30 cent?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We should allow people to get on with the real economy and maintain some confidence in it rather than suggesting it is not even worth talking about.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I would like the Government to respond by arranging a motion, statements or questions about the bank recapitalisation programme for this week or next Tuesday.  I say this in all sincerity.  It is necessary that the House has an opportunity to tease out the implications of the statements by the Minister for Finance and where the Government intends to go with the matter.  Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to wait until the House returns in January to deal with legislation in terms of D&aacute;il authorisation for the Government to use moneys from the pensions reserve fund for any capitalisation programme?</P>
        <P>When is it proposed to give the House an opportunity to discuss the revised health programme as outlined and approved by the Minister for Health and Children, which was seen and announced to the nation by the national broadcaster?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss that matter now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will any legislative changes be involved that might require a discussion in the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the recapitalisation issue, it is a matter for the Whips to discuss if people want statements.  To hear the views of the House would be no harm and might be helpful.  Some statements at some time during the week could be considered, but it is important to point out that timetables are involved.  Depending on what type of recapitalisation were to emerge, various timetables apply in terms of rights issues.  They are far longer than the House&rsquo;s break for the Christmas period.  I want to emphasise that the Government is in a negotiating position.  Therefore, the question of statements might be helpful in that context, but we should not go beyond it at this point.</P>
        <P>The HSE service plan is for 2009 and can be discussed at any time by the House in the course of 2009.  There are statutory requirements for the laying of the plan before the Houses of the Oireachtas, which I understand were complied with by the Minister for Health and Children.  Therefore, the agreement of a service plan does not of itself require a legislative change.  Under existing legislation, it can be laid before the Houses and discussed during the course of the next session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement to the effect that time may be allowed for a discussion of the bank capitalisation proposal.  It will send a solid signal to markets, namely, that the Government has some sense of what it wants to do.  To wait until the end of January would be unbelievable.</P>
        <P>Concerning promised legislation, the T&aacute;naiste stated on 20 November that health insurance legislation would be introduced in the D&aacute;il before the recess.  When will we see the legislation?  She stated that it would be published before Christmas, but we have not seen it.  Will we see it in the coming days?</P>
        <P>On the Order Paper, No. 8 is intended to commemorate the first sitting of the first D&aacute;il.  The Labour Party will be delighted to participate.  In terms of the development of our democracy, was the Taoiseach not saddened by the forced resignation of Mr. Niall Crowley as the chief executive of the Equality Authority?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>This day last week in response to the 43rd brutal murder in the State since the beginning of the year, the Ceann Comhairle facilitated the asking of questions to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the House as to initiatives the Government might introduce to stop the spiral of killing and stem the tide of crime.

	<P>On promised legislation, this is a serious matter.  On 23 September, the Chief Whip&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an abuse.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;published the list of legislation to be published and enacted before the end of the session.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s section includes the criminal justice (forensic sampling evidence) Bill, the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, the criminal justice (money laundering) Bill and the sale of alcohol Bill.  Why has none of this legislation been enacted and why has not a single one of these Bills been debated in the House since 23 September?  None of them has been published.</P>
        <P>By way of a further initiative, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised that a covert surveillance Bill would be published and debated before the end of this session, but there has been no sign of it.  The Minister&rsquo;s action in respect of it has certainly been more covert than anything else.  It is important that we debate this matter before the end of the session.  The Minister&rsquo;s only response to the crime and murder taking place in the State has been to announce the general scheme of the criminal justice (public order)(amendment) Bill, which relates to vagrancy and is designed to prevent people begging on the streets in the run-up to Christmas.  Will the Taoiseach indicate the proposals of the Government in respect of these Bills, which were promised last September?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will go through the Bills to which the Deputy refers in detail.  Dealing with violent crime and murder is an operational matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The force is devoting many of its resources to dealing with these matters and is enjoying much success in many respects.  I do not wish to take away from the seriousness of the ongoing problem but it is not just a question of enacting legislation.  A great deal of appropriate legislation has been enacted in recent years and has been of major assistance to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with the matters to which I refer.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is committed to bringing forward further legislation.</P>
        <P>Drafting is progressing in respect of the criminal justice (forensic sampling and evidence) Bill.  In light of the need for further consultations on procedural and technical aspects, as well as the need to study the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights on 4 December last in the case of S and Marper <i>v</i>. UK on the retention, etc., of samples and profiles, it now seems unlikely that the Bill will be ready for publication before the end of January next.  The reason for this is that we must ensure that we make provision in respect of the issue to which I refer.  The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights is being examined by the Department and the Office of the Attorney General.  Publication will take place sometime after the conclusion of this examination.</P>
        <P>Drafting on the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is expected to be completed by the end of the year.  It has been necessary to include some additional amendments to existing firearms provisions.  However, it is expected that the Bill will be submitted to the Government for approval to publish in January.</P>
        <P>Drafting is ongoing in respect of the criminal justice (money laundering) Bill.  A number of legal and technical issues have arisen and these have delayed progress on completing the Bill.  It is unlikely that the Bill will be available this session.</P>
        <P>The text of the property services (regulatory) Bill is being finalised, subject to clearance by the Attorney General on some technical and legal aspects.  Drafting of the text of the sale of alcohol Bill has been delayed because the Parliamentary Counsel charged with responsibility <Col N="822"/>in this regard is also drafting the property services (regulatory) Bill.  There are doubts that the text of the sale of alcohol Bill can be ready for publication this session.  However, it should be ready for publication early in the next session.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am seeking clarification from the Ceann Comhairle.  The House may have been misinformed earlier today by the Minister for Health and Children, who stated that she laid the HSE&rsquo;s national service plan before the D&aacute;il on Wednesday last, 10 December.  However, the plan is listed on today&rsquo;s Order Paper and has only just become available from the Oireachtas Library.  It was not available earlier this afternoon.  Will the Ceann Comhairle indicate whether the Minister may have inadvertently misled the House in respect of the plan, which contains proposals for over &euro;500 million in cuts to the health service?  This is an extremely serious matter.  If the plan was laid before the House on Wednesday last, it should have been available to Members before the Minister for Health and Children answered parliamentary questions in the House today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan for highlighting the fact that the plan is now actually available to Members, which was not the case earlier today.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government will accommodate a debate on the contents of the service plan before the Christmas recess?  Will he set aside time this week or make time available next week in order that we might discuss the &euro;500 billion in cuts to the budget of the HSE for 2009?  What is proposed will mean calamity for innocent individuals and already hard-pressed communities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The service plan can be debated in the House at any time after the Christmas recess.  More than &euro;14.7 billion is being allocated in respect of the provision of health services next year.  Engagement involving management and unions is taking place on the question of how greater flexibility might be obtained in respect of work practices.  Such flexibility would avoid the necessity of introducing the sort of front line cuts that are being suggested.  If one takes the position relating to nursing home payments into account, the underlying increase in next year&rsquo;s budget for the health service will be approximately &euro;580 million.  It is not correct to state that &euro;500 million less is being provided.  The increase in next year&rsquo;s budget is 3.2%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach was much more specific in respect of the legislation relating to estate management when he last referred to it in the House.  Will he indicate whether progress has been made on the Bill in the interim?  Constituents of all Members are deeply concerned at the lack of action in this area and the number of Bills mounting up.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will respond at this stage to that question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Drafting in respect of various aspects of this legislation is continuing.  The Deputy will be aware various Departments are involved.  The priority is to get the drafting complete and having done so to make a decision as to whether it would be best to incorporate all the issues, which are interconnected, into one Bill.  We must get on with the drafting in respect of the various aspects of this issue as it applies to various Departments.  Once that has been done we can engage with the Attorney General in respect of whether it would be more expeditious to incorporate all the issues in an omnibus Bill or to proceed separately with the issues through the various departmental priorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I wish to ask about an issue already raised, although in a slightly different context.  In view of the proposals announced by the Minister for Health and Children and released to the media in advance, will the Taoiseach <Col N="825"/>say, if in view of the magnitude of the slash and burn cuts right across the board, the Government intends&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a serious issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept it is a serious issue but we must move on and the issue raised by the Deputy must be in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Christmas is approaching; the Minister made these announcements which affect the population at large, which is hardly a Christmas box.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must put a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the legislation as promised be brought before the House?  The proposals announced by the Minister will have a widespread effect on the community at large.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach say if, for instance, it is intended to abolish the common cold and illness?  The situation is that people will be turned away&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan cannot, under any circumstances, make a Second Stage speech now.  I call the Taoiseach.  Is legislation promised in this area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, there is legislation promised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should name the legislation and allow the Taoiseach to answer in that regard so that we can move on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation concerned is a Bill dealing with health and personal social services.  Obviously, this will not be brought forward and will be abolished because there will be no services available.  The health information Bill seeks to provide a legislative framework for the governance of information in the health sector.  We do not even get such information in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan, please allow the Taoiseach to answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Other legislative proposals, including the nursing homes Bill and the legislation dealing with health insurance, which is an important matter, have had to be prioritised.  Work on some of these Bills is continuing.  The Minister for Health and Children has, in fairness, brought in more legislation to ensure uniform standards and eligibility rules in the aftermath of a variation of interpretations during the old health board era and must be given credit for doing so.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s contention.  I reiterate what I said earlier in response to other Deputies that the service plan includes &euro;14.7 billion for the provision of health services in this country next year, a substantial amount of money.  This sum is &euro;580 million greater than that provided this year, taking into account the nursing home subvention provision.  That is a substantial amount of money.  It is being contended that without further work practice changes it will be difficult to maintain the type of service levels currently being provided.  I believe, given the current economic situation facing this country, there is a duty on all of us to ensure we <Col N="826"/>agree whatever must be agreed in this respect so that we do not affect front line services and patients&rsquo; access to such services.</P>
        <P>A contribution of &euro;14.7 billion by taxpayers is a considerable commitment and one that warrants that type of co-operation at hospital and service level.  In fairness to those who represent workers in this area, I believe that co-operation will be forthcoming because of their commitment to the provision of a health service in line with current realities.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Joan Burton is out of order and the same applies to amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 9, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">2.&mdash;Marginal relief shall apply in respect of the income levy over &euro;18,304 threshold and up to &euro;25,000 in a manner to be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister for Finance under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am very surprised at the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s decision to rule out of order the first amendments.  Similar amendments to those have been allowed in previous years, to basically look at the impact on the taxation system of the various tax breaks and also in terms of having a taxpayers&rsquo; advocate to ensure they get the refunds to which they are entitled.</P>
        <P>The purpose of amendment No. 5 is to provide sliding or marginal relief in relation to the levy.  This budget has proposed a very draconian income levy, which will apply to everybody with an income over &euro;18,304.  As it is a levy, anyone who earns less than that &mdash; just about on a level with the minimum wage &mdash; will be exempt.  However, if someone earns &euro;18,500, he or she will pay the full 1% on the whole of the income.  For someone on an income just slightly above the minimum wage, it will mean that he or she will end up paying &euro;185 a year to the Revenue Commissioners.  This will be very difficult for employers, in terms of employment <Col N="830"/>policy, because it means that someone on the minimum wage who gets a small piece of overtime or a little bonus for having done some extra work effectively will be pushed into having to pay the levy.  What the Minister has done will act as a very severe incentive for hastening the return of the black economy in Ireland.</P>
        <P>There are spiralling rates of unemployment at the moment with tens of thousands losing their jobs.  The level of the levy is pitched very low and the fact that there is no sliding or marginal relief means that if, for example, somebody qualifies for overtime, there will be a major incentive for that to be dealt with under the counter.  This is one way in which the return of the black economy will be heavily facilitated.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>At present in Dublin and around the country, firms of accountants are suggesting to clients that they should split their income.  If some of the income, for example, &euro;17,900, is transferred to a wife, they will escape the levy completely.  If they have income of &euro;250,000 and were to split that among their family members in a family business, it will mean that the Minister&rsquo;s &mdash; and more importantly, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s &mdash; promise that people in the higher income echelons could not avoid the levy, and in fact would pay more, is set at nought.  Tax experts and accountants are currently offering off-the-shelf schemes which allow income splitting for people in the upper echelons.  The Minister and his officials know this.  It is all over town that these arrangements are very easily made for the purpose of avoiding the higher rates of the levy.  I will explain to the Minister how it is done.</P>
        <P>If family members are employed in or are directors of a company, the income is split among them.  People at the top levels, therefore, who are meant to pay 2% to 3% &mdash; the Minister was very proud of how progressive his legislation was &mdash; will have an easy avoidance mechanism.  However, the Minister is not prepared to do anything for those at the bottom of the scale, the type of people who should be encouraged to go to work and not end up on social welfare or return to the black economy.</P>
        <P>Since it took office, the Government has been seen to be all at sea.  The Minister marched into the D&aacute;il that day and said he was appealing to patriotism.  Where is the patriotism in the very wealthy being able, and allowed, to split their income to avoid the higher rates of the levy &mdash; 2% and 3% &mdash; while people on lower incomes have no margin of relief?  It would not cost the Minister very much to recover this lost income if he wanted to by simply applying the levy to those on the higher scale, while ensuring they had no avoidance mechanisms.</P>
        <P>Later on, the Labour Party is offering him an opportunity in the Bill to secure and copperfasten anti-avoidance mechanisms.  The Government seems bewildered, uncertain and unsure.  However, when the levy comes out of the pay packets of those who will still have jobs at the end of January, they will be hit very hard.  I do not know whether he quite appreciates the wave of reaction that will follow when employees see that levy taken out of their wage packets at the end of January and accumulating through February and March.</P>
        <P>To be fair, there ought to be a marginal relief mechanism where somebody gets overtime or is paid a small bonus or facilitates his or her employer by working extra.  I met a security guard in one of the shops in Blanchardstown town centre yesterday who earns &euro;17,000 a year.  He had a better job, which went, and now he is working as a security guard in one of the British chain stores, for which he is being paid the going rate.  He will not be liable, technically, for this levy.  On a zero hours contract, common in the retail trade, the worker usually has no choice if asked to do overtime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Such a contract means that if an employer wants somebody to work 25 hours this week, because of another employee&rsquo;s absence through illness or whatever, he or she is obliged to accept the extra work.  Normally, people are happy to accept the extra work because it does <Col N="831"/>not worsen their overall financial position.  However, if they accept the extra work, they get caught in a clear poverty trap where they are liable for the full rate if they go over the &euro;18,304.  This is an important and significant introduction of a new poverty and anti-employment trap.  The Minister could easily address it, at little cost, by introducing some level of marginal relief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I proposed amendment No. 9 to try to achieve a fairer taxation system or to take at least a small step in that direction.  The threshold of &euro;18,304 is an extremely unfair level at which to commence the 1% levy.  The level of &euro;37,000 is more in line with the average industrial wage.  Surely somebody on an amount below the industrial wage should not have to shoulder the burden of the 1% levy.</P>
        <P>In the case outlined by my colleague, Deputy Burton, if the security guard was due to go home at 6 p.m. but the colleague due to relieve him did not turn up in time and he was asked to stay till 7 p.m., he could suddenly be over the threshold.  People do not become liable for that element of the 1%, but for the full amount and that is grossly unfair.  This discourages the work ethic.  Why would anybody want to be enterprising, seek overtime or get stuck into the job in order to enhance themselves or their employer when a penalty is about to be applied to them, a penalty that is exceedingly unfair?</P>
        <P>Many of the points were made on Committee Stage, but it is worth pointing out again that this levy penalises families on low incomes and removes vital spending power from them.  It will cost these families in excess of &euro;500 per annum when the cumulative effect is taken into account.  As the Minister did not change his mind on this on Committee Stage, I do not expect he will do so now, but let us hear what he has to say anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister has improved the appalling proposal he announced in the budget by providing for some exemption limits and a more tiered structure.  That is a step forward.  I would accept the current proposal as not a bad outcome if there was a sunset clause on it, in other words, if we knew it was a temporary measure and would be withdrawn.  Unfortunately, the history with regard to drawing income tax proposals of this nature to a close is not good.  As mentioned, the income tax code was introduced as a temporary measure during some war in the 19th century and has survived two centuries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is for this reason that I cannot understand the reason the Minister does not adopt some of the structures of existing tax codes.  We already have three income tax codes and now he is introducing a fourth.  It has been called the &ldquo;Lenihan levy&rdquo;, so, hopefully, he will be immortalised through that title.  PRSI has both a threshold and an exemption limit, which provides fairness, particularly to those on low incomes.  The health levy has an exemption limit set at &euro;25,000, which is higher and closer to the suggestions being made for this levy.  Income tax has a threshold of approximately &euro;18,000 or &euro;19,000 before a person must pay tax.</P>
        <P>This levy is the least fair to people on low incomes and introduces poverty trap features that would cost very little to remove.  The Minister said it would cost &euro;60 million in total to remove them.  The Minister should put that in place, even at the cost of recovering the &euro;60 million somewhere further up the scale.  People on this side of the House would accept that.  It is not good practice to have a tax like this.  An elderly couple, for example, on &euro;40,000 would pay nothing, but on &euro;40,001 would pay &euro;400.  Where is the fairness in that?  Why, when the unfairness has been pointed out, would the Minister consciously and knowingly say that is the sort of code he will introduce?  The Minister put a cost of &euro;60 million on it.  If he recovered the &euro;60 million further up the scale, people would not quibble about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>There are proportional scales in all the other tax areas.  Regarding income tax, for example, there is marginal relief above a certain level of income.  If the margin between the exemption limit and the amount of income is less than 40%, there is marginal <Col N="832"/>relief.  The same applies to PRSI where there is an exemption limit and people are taxed at 4% above that rate.  Furthermore, the health contribution, unlike this levy, was for a specific purpose and people on an amount below &euro;26,000 a year are exempt from it.  The health levy was for health and the income levy was for youth employment.</P>
        <P>The Minister should accept the reasonable proposals being made in these amendments as they are about providing relief at the lower end.  They suggest relief on a scaled basis.  It seems the Minister considers this levy an income tax, although he has called it a levy.  If marginal relief is available for normal income tax, the Minister should consider the proposal I have put forward for some kind of marginal system at lower income levels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume what Deputy Burton has in mind is an allowance of &euro;18,304 for individuals with income up to &euro;25,000 or some similar mechanism.  This would have the effect of reducing the income levy payable by such individuals by &euro;183 per annum.  This would cost the Exchequer approximately &euro;60 million in the full year and would add a considerable level of complexity to the system.  If the Deputy believes that this amendment would solve the issue of the step effect, I would have to say it would not, but merely move the step up and cost &euro;60 million in the process.</P>
        <P>If I understand Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s amendment correctly, it would introduce a fourth rate of 0.5% to the income levy.  It would mean that a levy of 0.5% would apply to incomes between &euro;18,304 and &euro;28,304 in the case of a person under 65 and for income between &euro;20,000 and &euro;30,000 in the case of single persons over 65 and between &euro;40,000 and &euro;60,000 for a married couple where one or both is aged 65 or over.  This would also cost approximately &euro;60 million in a full year and the maximum benefit to individual workers would be less than &euro;3 per week.  There would be considerable difficulties in payroll implementation.</P>
        <P>Deputy Morgan&rsquo;s amendment proposes to almost double the exemption threshold.  The cost of this measure would be &euro;185 million in 2009 and &euro;265 million in a full year.  Aside from the significant cost of the measure, it would also mean setting a lower exemption threshold that is 7% above the projected average industrial wage for 2009.  The cost of these amendments would have to be recouped from elsewhere.</P>
        <P>With regard to Deputy Burton&rsquo;s point about income splitting arrangements, the transfer of assets to a spouse to avoid paying the levy at 3% would be of minimum benefit in that the spouse would also be subject to the levy in his or her own right.  Transferring an asset to effect a saving of 1% or 2% of income levy would, in many cases, cost more in conveyancing and legal costs.  Likewise, paying a spouse through the accounts of a business, where the spouse is not actually employed, would not be an expense which is wholly and necessarily incurred in the performance of the business.  Therefore, it would not be allowed as a deduction.</P>
        <P>Deputy Bruton rightly referred to the complexity of the income tax and other variable systems we have in place.  In substance, the operation of PRSI, the health levy, income tax and this levy amount to an income tax system.  I agree with Deputy Bruton on that and look forward to the proposals of the Commission on Taxation in that respect.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell contrasted the treatment of marginal relief, income tax and PRSI with this particular proposal.  Income tax is at a rate of 20% and PRSI is also substantially in excess of this sum.  I do not believe the Deputy is comparing like with like in discussing marginal rates in the context of a 1% levy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I find the Minister&rsquo;s approach very disappointing.  When governments around the world are producing stimulus programmes for their economies, the strategy in this <Col N="833"/>budget is not only to increase taxes, but to increase them in a counterveiling way.  Much of the increased taxation in the budget is disastrous for the real economy.</P>
        <P>Of the tax increases the Minister put forward in the budget, the levy means there will be a poverty trap because it offers no marginal relief.  If people move from &euro;18,304 to &euro;21,000, &euro;22,000 or &euro;23,000, they will immediately incur an extra &euro;183 in tax.  These are the people at the bottom of the scale and they, more than anybody else, are the ones the Minister should wish to encourage to earn more income.  Their earning more income has two important benefits.  First, it gives a person who is on little more than the minimum wage an opportunity to have a much better standard of living.  A sum of &euro;183 per year will buy a lot of sliced pans, sausages and chips for families on very low incomes.  These are the people whose children end up eating cheap food because they cannot afford expensive food.  This measure is not without implications for people&rsquo;s lifestyles.  A person on social welfare is exempt, correctly, from the levy.  However, we are talking here about the working poor.  In his scheme, the Minister proposes to tax the working poor and if they earn a little bit over the minimum, he will tax them even more.  I know the Minister is not without compassion.  All we suggest is a marginal scale of relief.</P>
        <P>The tax increases, such as the 0.5% increase in VAT, are the worst signal the Minister could send out.  He would have done better to send everybody free tickets to travel to Newry rather than raise the VAT rate by 0.5%.  His tax increases are ill-thought out and do not produce any kind of economic stimulus, unlike measures taken by every other government in the world.  Instead, they will make people want to keep their incomes low and, in the case of the VAT increase, will make them want to shop in Newry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Arthur Morgan and I remind Deputies they have two minutes for their contributions in this part of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s point that there would be an additional cost to the Exchequer were he to accept my amendment.  However, I also sought to bring the 2% levy threshold to incomes of &euro;100,000 instead of the current level of &euro;150,000.  In addition, I sought to introduce a 3% levy for incomes in excess of &euro;200,000, on the basis that people with that level of income are in a position to afford such a levy.  This is in complete contrast to people on lower incomes, who cannot afford to pay it.</P>
        <P>In effect, the Minister is impoverishing, significantly, a substantial number of people on very low incomes.  As we face into the economic downturn, the number of people involved will be ever growing.  Although my amendment contains what the Minister might consider a negative implication, on the other hand, had he accepted my other two amendments, there would have been a significant positive implication because they sought to alter the thresholds for people on higher incomes.</P>
        <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy Richard Bruton that at least income tax is fair, in that if there is a threshold, one&rsquo;s income up to that threshold is exempt.  That is not the case here.  Does the Minister not accept the point that there is, for example, a disincentive for people to work overtime?  In certain cases, when employers might not have enough work to create a new position, they can give an existing employee a few hours of overtime.  It is a more cost-effective way of dealing with the issue rather than going the other way.  However, employees are now going to be taxed right back to the beginning and they will not accept it.  What does the Minister think of that point?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have nothing to add to what I already said.  I remind the Minister that in the existing exemption thresholds, also at &euro;40,000 and &euro;20,000, there is marginal relief.  This is not rocket science.  We are not asking the Minister to invent something that has not been thought of before.  It is already there in codes where an intermediary rate applies and <Col N="834"/>there is an exemption threshold.  It smooths the impact.  The Minister appears to be persuaded by the arguments but he is waiting for the Commission on Taxation to tell him what to do.  I honestly do not think that is a great answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not persuaded by the arguments or I would accept the amendments.  The bottom line here is that  &euro;60 million is involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Burton referred to the need for a stimulus package.  The capital programme in the budget is a substantial stimulus package.  It involves in excess of &euro;8 billion of borrowing that has been applied for investment purposes.  That is a very substantial stimulus for the economy and is the type of package that most other small open European economies are adopting in the current economic circumstances.  The type of stimulus package that Deputy Burton seems to envisage is one where tax, direct or indirect, is reduced in order to create more purchasing power in the economy.  We know that such a measure in this country would lead to further imports.  It is not clear that the decision of the United Kingdom Government to introduce such a stimulus will work.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the question of the Commission on Taxation, I await its proposals on the reform of the complexity of our income tax system.  However, in respect of the levy, I do not believe the amounts involved are such as to impose substantial, or any, hardship on individuals.  I am amazed at the position taken by socialists in Ireland, such as Deputy Burton.  They do not study the practice of their comrades in Scandinavia who believe that all income should be subject to income tax.</P>

      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment No. 6 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 9, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">2.&mdash;For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in respect of relief from taxation in respect of remittance arrangements is intended to constitute relief in respect of the income levy.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">With reference to the Minister&rsquo;s last comment, this amendment will test which of us is closer to Scandinavia and which to the Cayman Islands.</P>
        <P>The Minister re-introduced the remittance basis.  In that measure he suggested that if high rollers in the banks, the financial services industry and in research and development who were to come into Ireland and who were important to the development of a business, were non-domiciled and from outside the EU area, they would be taxed from now on according to the rules.  As I understand it, they would then get a refund of tax in respect of income of more than &euro;100,000 which they had not remitted into this country.</P><Col N="835"/>
        <P>On the night the levy was announced, I recall the Taoiseach saying it would apply to everybody, without fear or favour.  As I understand from the information presented by the Minister concerning the return of the remittance basis and tax voidance for very high rollers, these people may not incur the levy, other than in respect of the &euro;100,000.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to clarify the following point.  Will someone who is on the remittance basis and who has an income from their multinational of, say, &euro;200,000 a year pay &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 on the levy, or will that person pay just &euro;1,000 on the remittance basis of &euro;100,000 a year?  If that person is to pay the lower amount, it is obviously a very neat piece of tax avoidance and completely gainsays what was committed to in this House on the discussion of the budget.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure we have complete clarity and that the levy arrangements apply to the whole of such people&rsquo;s income.  The Minister is offering them a very generous avoidance of tax based on the arrangements he brought forward.  He is taxing somebody on &euro;18,500 at 1%.  What is he doing to those who are, as the Minister said, very high rollers?  What are the Minister&rsquo;s intentions in this regard?</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to people not conveying assets in order to avoid the levy.  I did not suggest that; I referred to splitting income.  I know that conveying assets can be expensive but splitting income in a family-owned company is not expensive.  As I understand it, the levy applies to income.  To give an example, a couple has an income of &euro;200,000.  If one person in that couple earns the &euro;200,000, he or she pays 1% on the first &euro;100,000, which is &euro;1,000, and 2% on the second &euro;100,000, giving a total levy liability of &euro;3,000.  If the couple splits the income between a husband and wife, giving each &euro;100,000, they would both pay a 1% levy, so each would pay &euro;1,000 and, therefore, their total levy bill as a couple is &euro;2,000.  If they split it even wider among other family members, which is perfectly allowed for, they may be in a position to diminish it even further because they could pay each of their children &euro;17,500 and no levy would arise at all in regard to that.  This facility is contained in the legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the Swedish model.  He will tax people on &euro;18,500 at 1% of all income, yet he is leaving wide open the capacity for perfectly legitimate avoidance by making arrangements in regard to income.  He has not told us or made clear what anti-avoidance mechanisms exist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the scheme outlined by Deputy Burton, the person must earn the relevant sum in the income split.  If, for example, the business is a family farm, the person must do the equivalent amount of work to split the income.  One cannot notionally assign income to two or three different persons in a particular family.  In the treatment of the accounts submitted, there must be a real value performed by the person in respect of whom the income is paid.  There is ample power in the legislation to set aside such arrangements and, indeed, evidence through the levy of the existence of such arrangements might furnish a pointer to the commissioners in regard to when such operations were being carried out.  I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s argument that this is a valid avoidance scheme but it does draw attention to the fact this levy, unlike the levy introduced when Deputy Burton was a Minister of State, has a progressive element to it and has 2% and 3% rates, not simply a flat 1% rate.</P>
        <P>To return to the topic opened by Deputy Burton of the tax treatment of persons who are at or just above the minimum wage rates, we in this country must be real about this &mdash; that was my reference to the Scandinavian issue.  According to the latest OECD data, Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the EU for single persons, married one-income couples and married two-income couples on average earnings.  A low tax wedge makes it easier for employers to employ staff.  Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the entire OECD for married one-income and married two-income couples on average earnings.  Ireland derives the fourth smallest proportion of tax receipts from labour of the EU countries.  Only Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta have lower tax <Col N="836"/>receipts from labour and, as we know, Malta has tax receipts from persons who want to claim tax benefits there.  Employees in Ireland make very low social security contributions by EU standards.  Only Lithuania and Estonia have lower employee social security contributions and employers in Ireland also have the third lowest social security contributions in the EU, just above Cyprus and Denmark.  We in this country have to recognise these facts because we are in circumstances where we must have a real discussion about the relative balance we have between taxation, borrowing and expenditure.</P>

	<P>Of course.  I became waylaid, for which I apologise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy&rsquo;s amendment proposes to insert a section in the Finance Bill which states that section 13 of this Bill, in providing for a repayment of tax where income is not remitted in particular circumstances, will not provide a relief from the income levy.  Section 13 provides for a relief by way of repayment where income is not remitted other than exclusion of that unremitted income from the operation of PAYE.  Therefore, the income in question will have been subject to the income levy in the same way as any other emoluments.  The provisions of section 13 are solely a repayment of tax deducted and not a repayment of any other levy, health contribution or PRSI that would be payable in respect of an emolument paid to an employee.  As the legislation already ensures there is no exemption from the levy provided in section 13 of the Bill, I do not see the need to state this and do not see any need for the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has confirmed this is dealt with as a levy.  The Minister himself referred to the lower income paid.  The point being made is that the figure of &euro;18,304 was picked because it is the exemption ceiling for PRSI.  If someone is on &euro;353 a week rather than &euro;352 a week, that person will pay an extra &euro;600 overall in levies per year.  The simple overall point we are making is that the Government should be ensuring this measure is progressive.  However, this means that if one earns an extra &euro;1 per week, one will pay an extra &euro;600 overall in levies per year, which is fundamentally flawed.</P>

	<P>No, but when the new remittance system goes into operation, I will seek to establish that what the Minister says actually applies because I believe strongly that the section the Minister has drafted is open to avoidance and mitigation in respect of the levy.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 11, line 19, after &ldquo;emoluments.&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;Notwithstanding the foregoing, capital allowances on investments undertaken in order to comply with government requirements would be allowed as a deduction according to the standard rules which apply for such an investment.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I resubmit this amendment because on Committee Stage the Minister did not have an estimate of the cost of the concession sought.  I am sure he has had the opportunity in the intervening time to work out its cost.  The Minister argued against the amendment on Committee Stage on the grounds that by investing in environmental protection or other compliance requirements, <Col N="837"/>one is enhancing the wealth of the owner.  In fact, these compliance requirements enhance the common good and not the wealth of the owner.  If the wealth of the owner were to be enhanced, there would be no requirement to have compliance rules and regulations, because it would be seen as a good investment.</P>
        <P>The same problem applies in this case.  There is no sunset clause on this tax.  As a result, unfair elements, apparent to everyone, are being imposed and will take on a life of their own, perhaps not for perpetuity, but for a considerable period.  We ought to take more care in this regard.  I accepted the Minister&rsquo;s argument that we do not wish to see very high earners sheltering income and avoiding tax and that the levy should apply.  However, the decision to rule out capital allowances is of far greater import than simply addressing the case of a small number of high net worth individuals who succeed in avoiding every tax.  This goes to the core of what constitutes one&rsquo;s income before or after allowances are calculated, and what is needed for investment to keep the business in operation.</P>
        <P>I am not happy with the caviller argument of the Minister to the effect that applying a system of levies which takes no account of people who plough money back into their business is fair, because a small number of high net worth individuals avoid every tax.  If one wishes to tackle tax matters relating to high net worth individuals, I can provide many ideas.  One could cap the aggregate of tax reliefs available from any source at a given figure.  We previously suggested a figure of &euro;100,000.  There are many ways of getting at those individuals without creating a tax structure which is inherently flawed, which is the case in this instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Although they have attempted to do so, my officials find it difficult to put an exact figure on the amount that would be lost to the levy were capital allowances permitted.  As Deputy Bruton is aware, the income levy has been introduced as a measure to re-establish tax revenues.  It applies across all income streams and it is determined on an individual basis at progressive rates, depending on the financial circumstances of the individual.  The amendment proposed by the Deputy would grant special treatment to those individuals who are obliged to invest in capital assets to satisfy requirements of the particular sector in which they trade.  That would be contrary to the general thrust of the policies underpinning the income levy and would place certain taxpayers in a preferred position over others.</P>
        <P>The tax system already provides reliefs in respect of such capital investments, allowing the investor to write off against income tax in full the relevant cost of the investment over a defined period of time.  The capital investment referred to by Deputy Bruton can already be claimed against income tax and written off in full over the period of the investment.  I fail to see how the 1% levy prejudices the person in question.  It should be noted that the acquisition of assets for use in a trade normally results in an increase in the asset wealth of the business and the possibility of the owner disposing of this asset at a gain at a later date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Bruton indicated on Committee Stage that the particular capital investments about which he was concerned and which prompted this amendment related to farming investments to comply with the EU nitrates directive.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food made generous grants available for many of these particular capital projects.  The remainder of the cost of these projects can be written off in the normal way against income tax.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 38, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;8.&mdash;Where medical expenses claimed as a tax credit consist of or include IVF treatment, the expenses shall to that extent be allowable at the higher rate.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I raised this matter with the Minister on Committee Stage.  The Minister has proposed to flat rate medical expenses relief, which was allowed at 41% and to reduce the relief to 20%, save in the case of nursing home expenses, which will remain at 41% for some time.  I drew the Minister&rsquo;s attention to an area in which I believe there is a particular hardship being inflicted.  It applies to couples and persons undergoing a course of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, IVF, treatments.  I also raised this matter with the Minister for Health and Children and I have confirmed that IVF treatment is not available in the country.</P>
        <P>Where a couple wish to have a child, have exhausted other possibilities and have undertaken a course of IVF treatment, it must be done on a private basis.  It is not something for which medical insurance companies will pay, or for which they will make a substantial contribution.  Normally, it must be paid for by the couple involved.  For many such couples it may be the last opportunity to have a child and the treatment is, therefore, very important and significant for them and their wider families.  These people experience a longing, hope and desire to have a child.</P>
        <P>The process currently involves protracted medical investigations to see if the woman is suitable for the treatment.  Then, if it is possible and recommended to undergo the treatment, one must provide for up to three or more courses of treatment.  The initial investigation and each course of treatment can cost between &euro;2,000 and &euro;3,000.  It is not unusual for a course of IVF treatments to ultimately cost at least &euro;10,000 and I have heard of cases where it may cost up to &euro;20,000.  In such circumstances, the treatment must be carried out privately, because it is not available through any public treatment of which I am aware.  In that case the medical taxation relief is remarkably significant and important for couples.  Couples must fund the treatments and, in many cases, the preparation for the treatment, the investigations and the treatment itself often entail the woman reducing her workload or, in some cases, stopping work completely.</P>
        <P>Not everyone who goes for IVF treatment is well-heeled.  There are people in all circumstances who wish to have a child but cannot without the support of IVF treatment.  Their families may come together to help with financial support.  I asked the Minister to examine this matter.  The Minister for Health and Children suggested she would examine the matter and introduce a scheme to recognise the difficulties arising for affected couples.</P><Col N="839"/>
        <P>While statements have been made by parents who are taking their children for highly expensive orthodontic treatment, there is some level of provision through the public system for very severe cases.  This is the reason IVF treatment is unique.  I tabled this amendment again because the Minister had stated he would examine this issue to ascertain whether he could do something to assist.  The Minister should indicate whether, having had some time to think over the matter, it is possible for him and his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to do something to assist couples who find this is the only way in which they may be able to have a baby.  This is an extremely expensive option for which the State makes no public provision.  Although the Minister spoke glowingly a few minutes ago of Scandinavia, one can get some assistance there from the state in respect of such issues.  The Minister should indicate whether he has had time to think about this issue or to give some consideration as to how he might assist such couples.</P>
        <P>Incidentally, I refer in particular to those who already have entered the treatment process.  The ending of the higher rate health relief has taken them by surprise, as they have built up a budget that now has been increased by approximately 21% because of this unexpected change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak in support of these amendments.  Deputy Burton referred to the point I wish to make in respect of orthodontic treatment.  Public provision for orthodontic treatment is not great and is highly limited.  Many parents have started their children on courses of orthodontic treatment that can take up to two or three years.  They have committed to expenditure that is not of a type that one can incur before the end of 2008 to get relief at the marginal rate.  Many of those affected are on relatively reasonable incomes and pay tax at the higher rate.  If such treatment had started before an appropriate date, such as the date of the budget, consideration certainly should be given to extending marginal relief for a year.  This would be a reasonable proposition regardless of the cost.</P>
        <P>As for the over-70s, who are being caught by the 1% levy, their medical expenses as a proportion of their income are much higher than those of younger people and strong consideration should be given in respect of marginal relief.  I also wish to make a general point on the 1% levy to which the Minister referred.  While I am open to correction, the aforementioned levy is the first that is not for any particular purpose.  Normally, a levy is granted for a purpose.  For example, the health levy was granted for health expenditure and the income levy for youth.  The new levy really is akin to another form of income tax.  While one may call it a levy, effectively it constitutes income tax.  For example, in the area of capital allowances, aside from the point Deputy Bruton made previously, people in small businesses who invest in equipment and who are paying no income tax will be hit with this 1% levy, which constitutes income tax.  While the Minister may call it a levy, it is no such thing.  I support the amendments and restate my two points in respect of orthodontic treatment where it has been started and the ongoing medical expenses of the over-70s, for whom relief at the marginal rate was a huge factor in their disposable income.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish briefly to discuss amendment No. 16, which I tabled, which pertains to people who are over 70.  The Minister fails to appreciate the quadruple whammy this budget has administered to people in this category.  If one is a retired person aged 70 or over and has an income that is just over the average industrial age, one will be obliged to pay the 2% health levy for the first time, as well as the new 1% levy, which one would not have paid previously.  Moreover, one will lose one&rsquo;s medical card, which I conservatively estimate to be worth &euro;2,000, as well as the medical relief one would have received at the marginal rate, which I estimate to be worth between &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,500.  Through this budget, the Minister hit people in this category, with modest incomes and high medical expenses, for approximately &euro;5,000.  I refer to people with incomes of between &euro;36,000 and &euro;50,000, for whom this constitutes a 10% hit on their take-home position.</P><Col N="840"/>
        <P Just="Left">I simply do not understand the reason the Minister should decide that those who are 70 and over, whose income is greater than the magic figure of &euro;700 per week, suddenly have become those who should shoulder a 10% burden.  The burden is greater than 10% if it is taken from their after-tax income.  I cannot discern the reason the Minister has decided to do this.  This is the fourth measure to be targeted at them.  The Minister has removed the medical card from them and has hit them for the health and Lenihan levies and now proposes to hit them in respect of their relief for medical offences.  It is unfair and I cannot discern the rationale.  The Acting Chairman, who has his ear to the ground, will share my wonder as to the reason this measure is being taken.  This is the smallest of the concessions Members seek and the Minister should give it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to deal with the points raised.  Deputy Bruton raised the issue of income earners aged 70 and more who did not qualify for the medical card and has suggested both here and on Committee Stage that they would be obliged to pay the health levy.  This is not the case.  The Health Act 2008 provides that all persons aged 70 and over will be exempt from the health levy, no matter what is their income or whether they have a medical card.  This suggestion is incorrect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As for Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s amendment, I understand he envisages that higher rate taxpayers, who are 70 years old or more, should be allowed to deduct health expenses at their marginal rate.  The biggest health expense that an elderly person may face is nursing home fees and I have introduced an amendment to ensure that such fees will continue to be deductible at the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal rate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>They face medical expenses in their own home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Assuming that such people are insured, this is the biggest expense they face.  The majority of persons who are 70 years of age or more have no liability at the higher rate and many are exempt from tax altogether.  I am informed by the Revenue Commis<Col N="841"/>sioners that approximately 90% of all income earners over 70 do not have a liability at the higher rate and, therefore, would not be in a position to benefit from this amendment.  The proposition that one should have a special regime based on age for higher taxpayers cannot be justified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that only 5% would lose their medical cards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As for Deputy Burton&rsquo;s point, higher rate relief is of no benefit to standard rate taxpayers who seek IVF treatment and the reintroduction of higher rate relief is not the answer in this respect.  The Government must examine whether a scheme that will help both higher and standard rate taxpayers in the same way is feasible.  An expenditure-based scheme would be required, were this to be addressed in current economic circumstances.  I will raise this issue in that context with the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed by the Minister&rsquo;s statement.  He will be aware that a couple in which only one person works is subject to a much more penal tax code because of the absence on individualisation.  I believe I explained that for a number of people who undergo IVF treatment, the process can be highly intensive and one may find that only one spouse works.  Consequently, the Minister&rsquo;s remarks do not necessarily apply because single income couples enter the higher tax bracket much faster than do dual income couples.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I wish to share time with Deputies Upton, &Oacute; Snodaigh and Ferris.</P>
        <P>The motion I put before the D&aacute;il jointly on behalf of the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in calls for a moratorium on house repossessions, an expanded programme of social housing, new measures to deal with the problem of homelessness, stronger protection for tenants in rented accommodation and legislation to regulate the activities of management companies.</P>
        <P>As we approach Christmas 2008 there are more people than ever on social housing waiting lists, an unprecedented number of families are facing the threat of having their homes repossessed and homelessness is as prevalent as ever.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The threat of losing a home is possibly the greatest fear a family can face.  As unemployment grows, more and more families who took on heavy mortgage repayments, based on incomes they were then earning, now find that, as a result of the loss of one job or more, they are coming under pressure from financial institutions.  A spate of repossession orders in the new year could create a social disaster and the Government must negotiate a moratorium on repossession orders for the duration of this recession.  I note from this morning&rsquo;s newspapers that 14,000 households are over three months in arrears.</P>
        <P>The social housing figures published last week showed a jump from 43,700 to nearly 60,000 in just three years in the social housing list.  What is truly shocking about this figure is that the Government has presided over a doubling in the social housing list over the past ten years. <Col N="843"/> These figures show the extent to which Fianna F&aacute;il squandered the boom, leaving tens of thousands of families high and dry without adequate housing.  An expanded social housing programme would not only provide families with badly needed accommodation, but would also help to put the construction sector back to work.</P>
        <P>No Member of this House should need to be reminded about the issue of homelessness when we see the persons huddling in the porches and alleyways around Leinster House each evening.  Despite this daily reminder, there are an estimated 5,000 experiencing homelessness at any given time, almost 500 of whom are children.  It is in this context that I put the motion before the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is clear that as far as the Government is concerned it is a case of &ldquo;Crisis? What Crisis?&rdquo;.  How you define a housing crisis is determined by how you define the purpose of housing.  Do you see it as a commodity?  Do you see it as a home?  Do you want to build developments or do you want to create communities?  Ultimately, do you want developer-led Government or Government-led development?</P>
        <P>When this Government came to power the average house cost three times the income of a working family spread over a 20 year mortgage.  Just before the housing pyramid collapsed the cost of an average house had risen to 12 times the average income, with a mortgage of 30 plus years now the norm.  In the period 1997 to 2007 residential mortgage debt in Ireland grew to an extraordinary 522%.  Many made money from home buyers in that period as the market rose and many will continue to make money as these mortgages continue to be paid over the coming decades.</P>
        <P Just="Left">How did this happen?  The answer is simple.  Those who had a duty of care &mdash; Government, regulators and banking institutions &mdash; all neglected that duty and this country&rsquo;s future was invested in a property bubble.  An example of this mindset was best captured in April 2006 when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, spoke about the &ldquo;health&rdquo; of the housing market and sneered at economists who predicted a collapse.  With chest out he proudly proclaimed that people who listened to the &ldquo;loo-las&rdquo; would have missed the boat and would have to pay more for their houses at that time.  This is the type of frightening talk we are more used to hearing coming from dodgy salesmen, with a mantra that you should get in and buy now or you will have to pay even more later.</P>
        <P>It did not matter to Deputy Ahern or his Government that the cost of buying a home was out of control and running beyond the grasp of working people.  It did not matter that families were being locked into mortgages that would take them their entire working lives to clear.  It did not matter to them, in those sunny days, that when a rainy day came people would be in danger of losing their homes because of their recklessness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This motion, once and for all, seeks to banish the mindset that the primary purpose of housing development is profit for speculators.  This motion proposes that housing development, whether private or public, is to meet the needs of society in providing people with homes of a quality standard, at an affordable cost and providing long-term security.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If there has been a consistent theme to how Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s developer-led Government has been focused towards the housing market over the years, it has been to focus on sorting out the developers, and on getting new developments built; and then at some stage in the future maybe get around to sorting the problems of schools, transportation, green spaces, common areas etc.  In the private rental sector, for example, figures I obtained show that less than one in ten houses are inspected for standards.  The figures produced by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government show that less than 6% of 188,000 registered private rented dwellings were inspected in 2007.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, speaks of introducing guidelines and &ldquo;a dedicated stream of money&rdquo; to local authorities to carry out <Col N="844"/>inspections but it seems he neither has the determination nor the powers to ensure that inspections are carried out and that standards are enforced.  The result is that, despite promises of legislation, vulnerable people are left without protection.</P>
        <P>Just like social housing, the private rented sector fills an important function providing necessary housing for hundreds of thousands of people.  However, it is unacceptable that, despite the legislation in place, and the promise of even more in 2009, adequate enforcement of standards is still not in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is needed to ensure standards in the rental sector, whether private or social, is the creation of a national inspection regime ensuring that standards are enforced and which would guarantee the establishment of effective and efficient timeframes in which disputes would be resolved and, in the case of local authority housing, determine an acceptable period in which urgent repairs must be carried out.</P>
        <P>The problems relating to management companies are well understood and have been analysed to a great extent by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>These companies, many of which were set up by developers, need to be regulated in the interest of residents rather than developers.  The fact that they are currently in a legal no man&rsquo;s land is causing endless trouble for affected residents.  For several years, the Government has spoken about the need for legislation in this area but we are continually fobbed off with policy reviews and committee meetings.  This motion calls for less conversation from this Government and a lot more action.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we were to look to the long-awaited Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 as a remedy to the issues identified in this motion we would be well and truly disappointed.  That Bill was expected to deal with homelessness but, embarrassingly, this issue was omitted when it was first published.  The Government was shamed into cutting, copying and pasting a paragraph on homelessness into the Bill when it was debated in the Seanad.  The Bill&rsquo;s response to anti-social behaviour is to load additional bureaucratic nonsense upon local authorities without giving them any additional powers.  This will only add to the frustration that currently arises when residents make a complaint and find their situation has not improved at the end of a long and futile merry-go-round.</P>
        <P>The biggest indictment of the Bill is its revelation that the mentality of the Galway tent is still alive and well when it comes to promoting tenant purchase schemes.  The significant changes in this area are targeted towards shifting property described as &ldquo;new build&rdquo;.  There will, therefore, be no new incentives to regenerate existing communities by allowing tenants to purchase their homes.  In fact the Bill could cause a repeat of the exodus in the 1980s of earning residents from local authority estates, a mistake for which we are still paying the social and financial costs.  The Bill in its present form continues to ignore tenants of local authority flats, who have been left in the lurch for years and denied the right to buy their homes.  It intends instead to introduce a purchase scheme confined exclusively to new build property, whereby people who have been assessed for social housing can get a loan up to &euro;285,000 from a local authority once they have been refused a mortgage by at least two lending institutions.  Ironically, this is going to be called the first choice purchase scheme.  As everyone knows, people are refused mortgages for two reasons.  One is that the evidence indicates the prospective lender cannot pay back the loan and the second is that the property is over valued.  What purpose will this scheme serve other than to provide a sub-prime lending service and set a false floor price for new houses in a declining yet still over valued property market?</P>
        <P>While this country is no longer as wealthy as before, it is wealthy enough to be ashamed of its record on homelessness.  With housing vacancy rates in Ireland of 15%, it is unacceptable <Col N="845"/>that 5,000 people will be on the streets this winter.  We need a strategy which enables homeless people to make the successful transition from temporary emergency shelter to long-term accommodation.  This can only be done if the proper rehabilitation processes are in place and on the basis of a cross departmental and interagency approach.</P>
        <P>Even in today&rsquo;s falling housing market, hard working couples can find that the cost of buying a home exceeds ten times their income.  If they are waiting for social housing they can find their names have gone backwards rather than forwards on an ever increasing list.  If they live in the rental sector they cannot be confident that the basic guaranteed standards will be enforced.  For too long, this Government&rsquo;s housing policy has been driven by the needs of everyone but home dwellers.  The situation badly needs to be changed and the motion before the D&aacute;il demands that we get our priorities right and our house in order.  It is time to end developer led Government and to put in its place Government led development, whereby house prices are driven by affordability rather than speculation, standards are enforced and not just put on paper and communities instead of housing developments are built.  We need to look beyond the bricks and mortar to insist on a future built on a foundation of social conscience and integrity.  I commend this motion to the house.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The legacy of the Celtic tiger will not be relished by a large number of people in this country because of the fear it has generated in their lives.  They face a stark outcome of uncertainty about their homes, heavy debt from their mortgage commitments, lives in overcrowded conditions and shelter in hostel accommodation or a cardboard box in the doorways and archways not far from these Houses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the real outcome of the downfall of the tiger?  The number on the social housing lists now tops 56,000 and more than 5,000 people are homeless.  Major urban regeneration projects, such as St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore, have failed and revised plans have been scaled back significantly.  There is no regulation of management companies nor support for apartment owners, although a great deal of favour is shown to landlords and construction companies.  Unfinished and vacant housing and commercial developments dot the country, with all the signs of neglect and incipient dereliction.  Lack of regulation by the Financial Regulator led to sub-prime lending and 100% mortgages and spurred the recent spike in housing repossessions.</P>
        <P>There were opportunities over the past ten years to deal with homelessness and social housing but they were squandered.  The Government&rsquo;s job is to lead and make the right choices for all the people and not just the chosen few.  Above all else, it has the responsibility to protect those least able to look out for themselves.  This did not happen for many people who now face repossession of their homes or exorbitant mortgage payments which they cannot make because of rising unemployment.  The Government bought into the property bubble and bent over backwards to provide tax breaks to help developers continue building private homes.  There were no sanctions for the banks and mortgage providers which indulged in excessive and irresponsible lending practices.  I have previously referred in this House to the case of a woman on a community employment scheme who was given a mortgage worth &euro;150,000 that she has no prospect of repaying and is now facing the repossession of her house.  Tax breaks were available for second homes.  Poor planning decisions went unheeded and every attempt to update planning legislation to favour residents over developers was dismissed.</P>
        <P>As we look back on this activity it is clear that very little was done to support those in need of help.  Where are the supports for the thousands of homeless people?  A hostel for the homeless was built on James&rsquo;s Street in my constituency but was not opened for months because there was no funding for its day-to-day operations.  It was only today that the official opening of this facility took place, although I acknowledge it has now been open for several months.</P><Col N="846"/>
        <P>The legislation to regulate management companies seems to be stored in mothballs.  The future of our cities and towns is higher density development and, in all probability, more management companies yet the Government seems incapable of regulating these companies so that they work for their residents instead of their directors and management agents.</P>
        <P>Home repossessions are increasing.  An increasing number of people in my constituency are facing an uncertain future in their homes.  The social housing list continues to expand, with 4,991 people on the social housing list in the Dublin City Council area alone.  As this figure dates from February 2008, it probably underestimates the true nature of the current list.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we bail out the banks what does Ireland get in return?  Will we see an end to primary home repossessions for the duration of the recession, as is the case in the UK?  Will repossessed commercial space be given to community and sports groups?  Will houses in vacant developments be made available to people on housing lists?  Thus far, we have received absolutely nothing for bailing out the banks, despite the large cheque written by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to accompany the State&rsquo;s guarantee.  The Government has forgotten that it was using taxpayers&rsquo; money during the Celtic tiger era.  Now that the good economic times are over, it is clear that no real progress towards equity and equality in the housing market was made.  We have thousands on the national housing lists and many more face evictions or repayments of sub-prime mortgages.  Public private partnership regeneration projects are foundering as developers look for more money and the Government&rsquo;s relentless drive to support developers has not given Ireland any long-term benefit or addressed the huge housing crisis.  The Irish housing boom was the emperor which never had any clothes and people are only just beginning to feel the consequences of the various ill-judged investments of taxpayers&rsquo; money over the years.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

        <P>In recommending this Private Members&rsquo; motion to the House I will outline Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s approach to housing and homelessness and speak to a number of central elements of the motion, which is co-sponsored by the Labour Party.  Issues related to housing probably constitute the bulk of most public representatives&rsquo; work throughout the country.  In my own area it probably accounts for approximately 80% of the people coming to the various clinics or advice centres that I or the councillors in my area have.  It is certainly the case at local authority level but I am sure if everybody in this House was asked what the bulk of their work would be at local level, it would be work dealing with housing and homelessness.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in believes housing is a right and not a privilege.  Whereas the majority of people living in the State can afford to own or rent their own home, an increasing number cannot.  That is a position which, unfortunately, is set to worsen given the current economic climate and the rapidly rising level of unemployment.  There is also an increasing number of people who because of that economic situation are being forced out of accommodation which they were in the process of buying through a mortgage and on to the public housing lists.</P><Col N="847"/>
        <P>I received figures tonight relating to the mortgage interest supplement which indicate the number of people availing of it has doubled in two years.  That is a yardstick by which to measure the crisis we are facing.  For such people, the State has a political and social responsibility to respond to their housing need and ensure they are adequately housed.  That is not something which can be reneged on simply because the economic climate has changed.  Addressing the housing problem is inextricably linked to the overall economy and particularly in an economy such as our own, where construction comprised such a major part and where so many people have recently lost their jobs.</P>
        <P>Whereas social benefit measures such as rent supplement, mortgage interest supplement and the rental accommodation scheme have a role in addressing housing problems, it is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view that the provision of social housing, funded by Government via local authorities, must be the central element in any successfully housing strategy.  Unfortunately, that did not happen over the most recent period when more resources were available to the State than at any other time in our history.</P>
        <P>Figures released last week by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Michael Finneran, demonstrate two stark facts.  The first is that housing need in the State is increasing every year and has now reached crisis proportions.  In March this year, 59,000 households were in need of housing, languishing on local authority waiting lists.  That figure has increased substantially since then, given the economic crisis.  More than 40,000 children live in these households and the most frightening aspect of that figure is that it has grown to such an extent over the years of economic prosperity.  Inevitably, unless immediate and urgent action is taken to tackle the waiting lists through a programme of public house building, it will continue to grow, perhaps even at a faster rate.</P>
        <P>A second stark fact was outlined in the Minister of State&rsquo;s figures, although he did not understand how stark it was.  The Government housing policy is failing, which is demonstrated by the fact that since 2005 housing need has increased by 30% and has doubled in the past decade.  As I have said, this was at a time when the State was arguably in a better position than ever before to do something positive to turn that issue around.  Unfortunately, it was content to allow the private sector and property developers dictate the housing agenda, often in ways that were detrimental to people either buying or attempting to buy their own homes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many of those issues are fundamental to the current overall economic position and the so-called credit crunch.  The simple fact is that the Government is not spending enough money on social housing and, as a consequence, local authorities are not able to provide sufficient social housing to meet local needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2005 the Government&rsquo;s own think tank, the National Economic and Social Council, stated that the State would need 200,000 social houses by 2012 if the housing need was to be met.  On the basis of the existing stock in 2005, this would require the building of 10,000 social housing units every year for seven years.  Since then the Government has committed to and completed significantly lower numbers of social housing than suggested by NESC, especially when one takes into account tenant purchase and de-tenanting, which leads to local authority housing stock being reduced.</P>
        <P>Everything is rosy in the amendment to be proposed by the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.  He will tell this House that in 2007 and 2008 the Government met its NDP commitments of 9,000 social units a year.  However, this is still nowhere near the level of new social units required to meet either the NESC targets or the levels of need in society.  It is also the case that Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s current partner in Government, the Green Party, made a commitment broadcast to everyone of building 10,000 social housing units a year if part of the Cabinet.  The <Col N="848"/>party has Ministers in Cabinet in Deputies Gormley and Eamon Ryan.  They must explain yet another failure to fulfil a promise made to the people who put them where they are.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in also believes that the figure of 59,000 households in need is a significant and deliberate underestimation of the actual level of need across the State.  When drafting the guidelines for the triennial housing needs assessment, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government instructed local authorities to remove a number of categories of households from the final figures.  These households included people designated by the local authority as in need of social housing but who are either living in local authority housing that was overcrowded, those who are materially unsuitable or living in the private rented sector.</P>
        <P>This is a cynical exercise in massaging the figures and in doing so it undermines attempts by local authorities to develop housing plans based on an honest and objective assessment of the levels of need in their areas.  It also grossly underestimates the true level of unsatisfactory accommodation and effectively condemns a significant number of people to continue to live in below-standard accommodation and to be unable to improve their position by accessing local authority housing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From a political perspective, the massaging of figures serves the short-term interest of the Government and the self-defeating purpose of pretending or seeking to portray the housing issue as not as bad as it actually is.  Such tactics tend to backfire, as the many thousands of people affected are unlikely to be fooled by the rhetoric or massaging of figures.</P>
        <P>Today I challenge both the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to come clean and release the full figures for households deemed by the local authorities to be in need of social housing.  That would at least give us a clearer and more accurate picture of the actual position and allow housing policy to be guided by a response to it.  That works under the assumption that the political will exists for it.</P>
        <P>As the joint Sinn F&eacute;in-Labour Party motion makes clear, our parties believe that in the current financial climate, Government and local authorities should do everything in their power to increase the stock of available social housing in the coming year.  If unsold properties on the private market meet the standards required by local authorities, represent value for money for the taxpayer and are appropriate to the needs of families on waiting lists, the Government and local authorities should actively pursue the purchase of these properties, hopefully at or below building cost prices.  In addition to meeting housing needs, it would have positive additional economic benefits.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With rising unemployment in the construction sector, the Government should also provide additional resources or loan guarantees to local authorities to commence an expanded social housing, new-build programme in the coming year.  I again urge the Minister of State to examine regeneration areas, which are blighted due to the collapse of their ill-thought out PPPs.  That approach would represent a significant boost to the construction sector and to the overall economy at the current time.</P>
        <P>At the minimum, we need 10,000 new social houses to be provided per year, net of tenant purchase, if the needs of the 59,000 households on local authority waiting lists are to be met.  I say &ldquo;at the minimum&rdquo; because the actual demand is undoubtedly higher.  In addition, the numbers seeking to leave private accommodation, which they are currently either buying or renting, will increase significantly over the next period if, as predicted, the economy continues to be in a depressed condition.</P>
        <P>At a time of rising demand and deepening recession, it makes both social and economic sense for the Government to invest in social housing.  Failure to do so will not only further exacerbate our economic difficulties, but will also lead to a further increase in levels of need, <Col N="849"/>with more families, including children, languishing on waiting lists in overcrowded, materially unsuitable accommodation, or in accommodation that they simply cannot afford.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Homelessness is another serious problem linked to the lack of suitable housing.  This phenomenon has been increasing in recent years and appears to have worsened in the current economic downturn.  At any one time, approximately 5,000 homeless people are living in the State and it is estimated that as many as 1,800 people become homeless each year.  For some of these, drug and alcohol addiction, family breakdown, domestic violence or psychiatric illness are the triggers that lead to homelessness.  Others, however, are actually part of the economy or have been recently let go from their jobs.  That is a particularly frightening aspect of the problem and illustrates both how it is possible to reach that situation and how difficult it is to escape from it.</P>
        <P>Whatever the reasons for homelessness, however, the central problem of those affected is that they cannot access a place to call home, and because of that they almost attain the status of non-persons.  Everything becomes far more difficult when a person has no home; life becomes more precarious and often dangerous.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, housing needs have reached crisis point with 59,000 households stuck on local authority waiting lists.  On top of that, many people are living in homes that are unsuitable, overcrowded and too expensive.  These people are most vulnerable to becoming homeless given their profile and problems.  Some 80% of people in that category are single men, representing the sharpest end of housing needs in this State.  That is especially so, given that they rate as a lower priority on the housing lists than others, for example, adults with children, but that is not an excuse for failing to meet their needs.</P>
        <P>That figure is a symbol of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing failure to meet the housing needs of the most vulnerable in our society.  Figures released yesterday by the Homeless Agency in Dublin indicate a 4% increase in homelessness in the city.  Some 2,300 people are homeless in Dublin city tonight.  I know that people are living in tents in the Phoenix Park, many of them from eastern Europe.  The homeless represent a cross-section of our society, including people who were recently part of the workforce but who have lost their jobs, are unable to keep up rental payments and have been forced onto the streets.</P>
        <P>I commend this motion to the House.  I urge the Minister of State to withdraw his amendment and vote with us to tackle the problems of homelessness and housing need in our society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh outlined, housing needs have reached crisis point.  Some 59,000 households are stuck on local authority waiting lists.  That figure has increased steadily over recent years and will continue to grow.  Those on housing lists are often living in homes that are unsuitable, overcrowded and too expensive.  They have to share accommodation with others, including family members, or are in private rented accommodation that they cannot afford.  Many families with children, in particular, are living in apartments and flats that have no facilities for children to play, either within or close to the buildings.  In many cases, that means that children spend much of their time cooped up inside.</P>
        <P>Much privately built and rented accommodation around our cities and towns is unsuitable for the raising of families, yet many families are being forced to rent them.  In many instances, this happens with financial support in the form of rent allowance because public authorities have been unable to meet existing demand and targets for social housing have not been met.  That means that what appears to be a saving for the public finances turns out to be a drain on them.  Instead of building a physical asset, the State has often provided large sums of money in <Col N="850"/>rent allowances to accommodate people who might otherwise be housed by local authorities.  In effect, speculators who capitalised on economic growth by building houses, have their mortgages paid for by the State.</P>
        <P>In my county, the housing list grew from 1,483 in 2002 to 1,831 in 2005.  Those years witnessed the pinnacle of the Celtic tiger, but despite that the signals were not recognised and the necessary steps were not taken to address the fact that the public housing building programme was inadequate to meet demand.  Since then, the situation has worsened considerably in Kerry and elsewhere.  The overall waiting list for the whole county is now over 3,300, which represents an increase of 82% since 2005.  Some 1,296 of these are on the county council waiting list.</P>
        <P>In Tralee town alone, the waiting list has grown from 948 in 2005 to 1,300 now, which is an increase of 37%.  In Killarney, the increase is even greater with the list having doubled in those three years to around 600.  That situation can be mirrored across the country in every council area.  It gives an indication of the demand that exists as well as the lack of facilities being provided by the State.  That extremely disturbing situation reflects an increasing dependence on the public housing sector as a consequence of house prices having been beyond people&rsquo;s reach.  In addition, the increasing number of unemployed has led to increased demands on local authorities.</P>
        <P>We cannot overlook the fact that while the economy was doing well and the public purse was full, resources were not invested in meeting that demand.  The State was content to allow the private sector, including lending institutions, to set the housing agenda.  That meant inflated mortgages and rents were often way out of line with wage increases as well as the consumer price index for other products and services.  We must recognise therefore that there was a considerable element of profiteering involved in the housing sector, which has contributed to much of the current economic crisis.</P>
        <P>It is not too late to address the shortfall in public housing.  It has been argued that a housing programme designed to clear the existing local authority housing list, which is almost 60,000 for the entire State, would provide a substantial boost for the construction sector and the economy in general.  If that route was followed we would be killing two birds with one stone: fulfilling a pressing public need and injecting much needed impetus and capital into the economy at a time of sharp downturn.  It would also reduce the burden on rent allowance.</P>
        <P>Homelessness is a growing problem that affects many people who have recently lost their jobs or who are in low-paid employment.  The demand for local authority and social housing is stark, but it needs to be met.  This situation offers an opportunity to the Government to sustain the construction sector and the economy generally.  We can do that and everybody will be prepared to put their shoulder to the wheel if the Government is prepared to take that chance.  Otherwise, it will be indicted for what has occurred, namely, a waste of money and the neglect of those most in need.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I am pleased to move the Government&rsquo;s amending motion in this debate.  I never cease to be amazed by the Labour Party&rsquo;s capacity to repeatedly table ill-judged motions, providing the Government with opportunity after opportunity to respond easily to its wide-of-the-mark claims by outlining our significant achievements.  Given the time of year, the Labour Party Deputies remind me of turkeys voting for Christmas.  For the purposes of tonight&rsquo;s debate, they have been joined by the Members of <Col N="853"/>the Sinn F&eacute;in branch of the turkey family.  If they will insist on playing the turkeys, we are happy to do the stuffing.</P>
        <P>I want to use my time this evening to do two things.  First, I want to outline recent developments in our housing policy and programmes, particularly in our housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, which was published early last year.  Second, I want to respond to some of the reckless scaremongering by elements of the Opposition concerning house repossessions, which were described in a performance by the Labour Party leader that I can only call hysterical as Ireland&rsquo;s biggest ticking social time bomb.</P>
        <P>Like all the best scaremongering, this is without foundation in fact.  It seeks to create panic and unease in households already feeling the effects of the current economic conditions, the very households for which the Labour Party purports to be concerned.  I will revert to this matter later.</P>
        <P>I want to outline how the Government has consistently delivered on highly ambitious policy objectives and output targets for housing in Ireland.  The Government&rsquo;s policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, sets out a vision to guide the transformation of the housing sector in the medium term by delivering more and better quality housing responses in a more strategic way focused on the building of sustainable communities.</P>
        <P>We are working on the implementation issues that need to be addressed to transform the housing environment to meet the challenges arising, many of which are identified in the policy statement.  I am pleased to say that substantial strides forward have already been made.  In recent years, we have made considerable progress in meeting housing needs through the broad range of social and affordable housing programmes.  In 2007 alone, more than 13,000 social and affordable housing units were delivered and the needs of almost 18,300 households were met across the housing spectrum.  This represents a significant increase of 24% on the level of needs met in 2006 and a significant step towards assisting an average of 20,000 households per annum over the seven years of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>We hear much noise but little content from the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in regarding housing.  They hope that their noise will drown out the facts.  It is time that the Labour Party faced up to the facts.  When it was last in office in 1997, the needs of 9,300 households were met by the housing programmes in place.  Last year, the Government&rsquo;s range of programmes met the needs of 18,300 households.  While the truth hurts, this Government is meeting housing needs at double the level delivered by the Labour Party.  I would have thought that before the Labour Party decided to try to lecture this side of the House, it would have undertaken at least some element of self-assessment of its own performance.  This is not surprising, as the turkeys voting for Christmas phenomenon is alive and well on the benches opposite.</P>

	<P>The commitment entered into by the Government under the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, was to achieve 27,000 social housing starts in the period 2007-09.  In terms of delivery, we set out to reach the first one third of this target in 2007.  By <Col N="854"/>the end of 2007, we had exceeded this target with a total of 9,061 starts across the local authority, voluntary and co-operative housing programmes and the rental accommodation scheme.</P>
        <P>An ambitious target of delivering 17,000 affordable homes in the years 2007-09 was set in the agreement.  The challenge presented to local authorities was to increase the supply of affordable homes, which stood at over 3,200 units in 2006.  Authorities rose to that challenge, delivering a significant increase in the supply of affordable homes.  They delivered more than 3,500 units in 2007, an increase on the previous year of 10%, and 2008 delivery is expected to exceed 4,000 units.  While short of targets, this is hardly surprising, given the significant changes in the housing market.</P>
        <P>The results of the housing needs assessment, which I published last week and which show an increase in net social housing need of more than 30%, are a reminder of the importance of sustaining this unprecedented level of effort.  The increase presents a challenging scenario.  However, in light of our delivery record, which all indications suggest is continuing at a strong pace in 2008, the increase is more representative of economic drivers, such as movements in houses prices and an increased number of foreign nationals resident in Ireland, than it is an indictment of what we have achieved in terms of output and the range of tailored supports put in place.</P>
        <P>Everyone knows the difficult economic climate in which we live and the pressures on the public finances.  Despite these, the Government is providing &euro;1.66 billion in funding for housing in the 2009 Estimates.  While this is a reduction of 4% on the 2008 Estimate, it is still well ahead of where we were in 2007 and, taking account of the better value now to be had in the market, will allow us to maintain strong momentum towards meeting our commitments in the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement and our long-term goals under the NDP.</P>
        <P>Despite the compelling demands and priorities calling on available resources, the Government has shown its commitment to minimising the impact of the tighter financial situation on the social housing programme.  The reduction in resources in this area of activity has been kept to just 1.7%.  Nevertheless, I accept that even small-scale reductions in funding present challenges for us and local authorities in terms of maintaining levels of activity at current levels.  Therefore, we are determined to optimise the use of available resources.</P>
        <P>One way or another, the extent of current housing need, notwithstanding the debate around how we best define it, demands a flexible and imaginative response to the structuring of our investment programme.  In the context of a difficult economic transition, we must seek to maximise the return on public investment, as measured by the extent to which we are meeting housing needs.  More than ever, we need to question the accepted ways of doing things.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One option that my Department will be pursuing with local authorities in the context of their 2009 investment programmes will be the use of long-term lease arrangements for social housing purposes to supplement traditional local authority construction or acquisition.  This would provide a more cost-effective, targeted approach in line with the principles of the life cycle concept endorsed by the social partners.</P>
        <P>Tackling homelessness, undoubtedly one of the most complex areas of my brief, will continue to be one of my top priorities in 2009.  When I launched the Government&rsquo;s new homeless strategy in August, I outlined my vision for ending long-term occupation of emergency accommodation and the need to sleep rough, two challenging but achievable targets.  The new strategy builds on the strong progress made under previous homeless strategies and sets out a vision to address adult homelessness over the next five years.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, when the first homeless strategy was published, more than &euro;600 million in State current funding has been made available for homeless services, as well as significant capital <Col N="855"/>investment in new facilities.  Despite the most difficult budgetary situation in decades, current funding for homeless services from my Department and local authorities will increase by 5% in 2009 to more than &euro;62 million.  This shows clearly the priority that I attach to addressing homelessness.</P>
        <P>The next key step in this process will be the completion of a strategic implementation plan.  The draft plan will be circulated later this week to the cross-departmental team on homelessness and the National Homeless Consultative Committee.  The plan, when published early in the new year, will provide a blueprint for the range of actions needed to pursue the aims of the homeless strategy.  We are already progressing a number of key measures that will feature in the plan.  Yesterday, I announced a new scheme to provide both homes and supports through leasing arrangements on a long-term basis for formerly homeless people, with an initial target of 300 homes to be delivered in 2009.  Work on development of this initiative is quite advanced and it will be launched through a competitive tendering process early in the new year.</P>
        <P>A figure of 5,000 homeless nationally has been cited in some quarters, but the source for this figure is unclear, particularly given that the 2008 housing needs assessment only identified 1,394 homeless households.  While I acknowledge this figure represents the number of homeless households that have applied for and have been considered eligible for social housing support, and therefore cannot represent the total number of homeless households in the country as a whole, I must also point out that it represents a decrease of 30% on the last assessment in 2005.</P>
        <P>The results of the counted in survey in Dublin, which I launched today, provide a very refined and comprehensive method of measuring homelessness.  The counted in report indicates that homelessness in Dublin has not changed significantly since 2005 and that there has been a small decrease relative to population growth.  There has also been a significant and extremely welcome reduction of 41%, down from 185 to 110, in the number of people reported sleeping rough.</P>
        <P>In common with society in general, many Members will probably have experienced, directly or indirectly, some form of anti-social behaviour.  While it is crucial that we make progress in this area, we must be clear that local authorities cannot be expected to deal with the criminality associated with such behaviour.  The latter is the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, using the powers available to it under the criminal justice code.</P>
        <P>The role of local authorities arises in respect of their functions as the landlords of some 110,000 dwellings.  In that capacity, they have a duty to secure and protect the interests of their tenants by preventing and addressing such behaviour in their estates.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 sets out to reflect the commitment of the Government in its policy paper, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, to increase statutory powers and actions to facilitate a targeted approach to combating anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>The proposed changes to the legislative framework include provisions requiring housing authorities to prepare an anti-social behaviour strategy and amend the definition of anti-social behaviour in the Housing Act 1997 to include damage to property, graffiti and impairment of the enjoyment of a person&rsquo;s home.  While these are significant enhancements to existing anti-social behaviour measures, it was not possible, in the Bill as published, to deal with all issues arising.  Discussions with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in respect of strengthening the statutory supports available to housing authorities are continuing.  I will be in a position to bring forward further provisions when the Bill is considered by the D&aacute;il early next year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill also contains significant provisions to improve and expand on the range of home ownership supports available.  We continue to believe that home ownership should be available to as many people as possible where this is their preferred option.  In this context, tenant purchase plays an important role for social housing tenants.  We are expanding the options for <Col N="856"/>existing social housing tenants and households qualified for social housing support with the proposed introduction of the new incremental purchase scheme.  This is an innovative scheme which involves transferring full title of a new house built by a housing authority or the voluntary and co-operative sector to the household on the payment of a proportion of the purchase price.  The housing authority or voluntary or co-operative body will place a charge on the property, in its favour, in respect of the portion of equity not paid for, and this will decline over time until the charge is eliminated.  In return, the buyer will pay his or her mortgage and accept full responsibility for the maintenance of his or her home.</P>
        <P>In so far as the tenant purchase of apartments is concerned, Deputies will be aware that previous efforts to introduce such a scheme failed due to a range of difficulties.  However, work is continuing on a model, based on the long-standing arrangements in the private sector for the ownership and management of multi-unit residential developments, which will address those problems.</P>
        <P>Clearly, the transition from a rented social housing complex to a mixed tenure of privately-owned and social-rented accommodation adds an extra dimension to the legal and practical problems that can arise.  Nevertheless, the ultimate aim of the Government is to establish a robust legislative framework that will stand the test of time for apartment buyers, apartment tenants who choose not to buy and local authorities.  I hope that legislative proposals for a viable apartment sales scheme can be finalised in time for consideration during Committee Stage of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.  In addition, the introduction of the new home choice loan from 1 January 2009 and changes to the provision of affordable housing will ensure there will be a closed loop in terms of routes to home ownership for households across the income spectrum.</P>
        <P>We have also made great strides in modernising the private rented sector.  A range of measures to update the minimum standards regulations for rental accommodation were recently approved by Government.  These will provide a platform for bringing standards in the sector into line with the expectations of a developed 21st century nation.  I am proud to deliver on this key Towards 2016 commitment and take a real step forward in significantly improving the quality of life of some of the most vulnerable members of society.</P>
        <P>Regulations to give effect to most of the package will come into effect generally on 1 February 2009.  They will apply in their entirety to all new first-time lettings from that date, while a four-year phase-in period will be provided in respect of existing lettings in order to allow them to comply with some of the more onerous provisions, such as the installation of dedicated sanitary facilities in each rental unit.  The remaining elements of the package will be given effect by legislative amendments to be introduced via the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</P>
        <P>Successful enforcement of the regulations is critical.  I will be emphasising to local authorities the continuing importance of rigorous and targeted inspections of rental properties.  I will continue to make dedicated funding available to them towards these ends and I am satisfied that increased funding for inspection activity and the increasingly performance-linked basis for allocations are contributing significantly to a much improved inspections regime.</P>
        <P>I wish to return to the issue of repossessions &mdash; the second main matter I intend to address.  There is no doubt that some households are experiencing difficulties in making mortgage payments in the current economic climate.  Good practice and good sense suggest that when people are in arrears, they need help.  They also need reassurance that there is a way in which their difficulties can be addressed.  Such people also require sound advice on what action to take.  What these people do not need is to be frightened or be subjected to &ldquo;foaming-at-the-mouth&rdquo; <Col N="857"/>scaremongering, with suggestions that robber baron banks and bully boy building societies are, like scrooges, lining up to take their family homes from them as soon as the spirit of Christmas disappears over the horizon.  However, that is exactly what the Labour Party has done by making great play of the suggestion that this is some sort of massive ticking social timebomb in existence.  The only timebomb of which I am aware is that Labour and Sinn F&eacute;in have put together, for political purposes, in order to shatter the legitimate and well-founded hopes of those who are experiencing difficulties in making mortgage payments that there are pathways through those difficulties.</P>
        <P>I referred earlier to the importance of the facts.  I will not allow the proposers of the motion to prevent the facts from getting in the way of their quest for a headline.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>To which facts is the Minister of State referring?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Citing repossession cases before the courts recently, they neglected to mention the fact that repossession is always a last resort for lenders and borrowers or that all members of the Irish Banking Federation subscribe to the code of practice on mortgage arrears, and are required to do so under the terms of the bank guarantee scheme.  The proposers of the motion also neglected to mention, as evidence published today by the Financial Regulator shows, that the number of repossessions made on foot of court orders between January 2005 and June of this year, is less than 130 out of a total of almost 1 million mortgage accounts.  The updated figure for the interim period is believed to be less than 160.  Those are the facts.  They cannot be contradicted and they are now a matter of record.</P>
        <P>The proposers of the motion further neglected to mention that many repossession orders do not lead to actual repossessions.  In fact, many repossession orders serve as a wake-up call for borrowers and prompt them to engage properly with their lenders in order to arrive at an agreed approach that is in the interests of both parties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The proposers also neglected to share with us the fact that lenders generally accept revised repayment arrangements where a borrower is experiencing difficulties but has a willingness to repay the mortgage.  They neglected to distinguish between repossession orders for principal residences and those relating to investment properties.  They failed to mention that the Irish Banking Federation&rsquo;s members work closely with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service in the development of appropriate debt management solutions for borrowers in financial difficulty.</P>
        <P>Why rely on truth when hyperbole will attract a juicier headline?  Instead of trying to create panic and peddle the fallacy that avoidance rather than engagement between lender and borrower is the solution, I want to ensure that mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings seeking home repossession.  I also wish to ensure that all lenders, mainstream or otherwise, have fair and reasonable procedures in place to deal appropriately with arrears and, where absolutely necessary &mdash; and as a last resort &mdash; repossession.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I warmly welcome the publication by the Financial Regulator of best practice guidance for lenders dealing with arrears and repossessions.  While concerns have been expressed in respect of how non-bank lenders &mdash; these account for less than 2% of the mortgage market &mdash; deal with arrears and repossessions, the information available to me suggests that such lenders, although not members of the Irish Banking Federation, are generally considered to operate in a manner which is compliant with the code.  Nevertheless, I have discussed with the Financial Regulator and the Irish Banking Federation how the position in this regard might be underpinned.  The Financial Regulator will be giving consideration to this matter in the context of the review of the statutory code of practice early in the new year.</P><Col N="858"/>
      
        <P Just="Left">For those households currently in difficulty with mortgage repayments, there are supports in place.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a supplement to be paid in respect of mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  While the amount payable varies, it will generally ensure that remaining income, following payment of mortgage interest, does not fall below a minimum level.  Advice can also be obtained from the Government&rsquo;s Money Advice and Budgeting Service, to which I referred earlier.</P>
        <P>While, as one would expect in a downturn, there has been an increase in the number of households in receipt of this supplement, this does not mean these households are at risk of losing their homes, rather it means that the Government has recognised and responded to their need by enabling them to remain in their homes.  We will continue to do this and, more important, we will continue to proactively respond to the root causes of increasing reliance on short-term income supplement by acting decisively in the long-term interests of current and future generations of Irish citizens.  The most enduring way we can do this is through the creation of employment and seeking to maintain to the greatest possible extent the economic progress we have achieved in the past decade.  This is where Government attention is firmly focused.</P>
        <P>I have outlined to the House the details of the Government&rsquo;s significant record of achievement, in particular in meeting the needs of those faced with lower incomes and those who need support to purchase a home.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, will contribute to this debate tomorrow night and will focus on our programme for further innovation.</P>
        <P>The motion before the House is a sad reflection on the proposing parties&rsquo; inability to offer any concrete policy proposals.  They do not have anything to offer in terms of housing responses for older people, people with disabilities or the Travelling community.  This is not exactly in keeping with the inclusive vision for Ireland shared by Arthur Griffith and James Connolly.  The only positive is that, based on this motion, it will probably be some time before the electorate gives them the opportunity to actually do anything concrete.</P>
        <P>In contrast, this Government has a coherent housing policy.  We are not simply addressing the specific needs of one group or sector.  Housing is for all people and this Government is delivering.  That is the bottom line, and we have the commitment and the vision to continue to do so.  I commend, without hesitation, the amendment to the House.</P>

        <P>We have a housing crisis, for which this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government has a lot to answer.  Failure is the hallmark of this Government&rsquo;s housing policy.  Currently, more than 56,000 people are on social housing lists.  This is a shockingly high figure which highlights the Government&rsquo;s failure to deliver to those people who find themselves in need of a home.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government had ample time and resources to house these people during the housing boom but turned a blind eye to them.  These massive waiting lists are a direct consequence of this inaction.  I am concerned that the numbers will continue to rise in the current economic climate, in particular when more homes than ever are being repossessed.</P>
        <P>What is even more alarming is that the latest figures, published in July 2008, indicate that more than 5,000 local authority houses remain empty.  This is at a time when huge numbers of <Col N="859"/>people are on waiting lists.  The Minister needs to be held accountable for his failure to turnaround properties in a quick manner.  In my constituency of Dublin North-East more than 80 properties are boarded up.  A resident has informed me that the house next-door to her in Darndale has been boarded up for the past year and a half.  Why has this been allowed to happen at a time when people are crying out for housing?  I call again on the Dublin City Council manager to ensure that boarded up houses are turned around within strict timelines.</P>
        <P>The comment by the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to RTE that he thinks 9,000 houses will be delivered this year, is not good enough, in particular given the growing housing lists.  I call on the Minister to provide 15,000 extra houses annually to reduce these housing lists.  Questions need to be posed as to why the Minister is handing over money to local authorities without ensuring regular checks in respect of performance delivery.  At the very least, there should be strict targets set to which local authorities should step up and achieve.</P>
        <P>The Government previously gave a commitment to end long-term homelessness by 2010.  Homelessness remains a major problem in society.  According to recent figures the number of homeless people nationally is 3,013.  However, this is not a true figure as it does not take into account the invisible homeless.  I remain unconvinced that this Government will deliver on its promise to end homelessness.  In July of this year, for instance, the HSE imposed a funding freeze on services in respect of homelessness resulting in people being turned away from emergency accommodation.</P>
        <P>The Government has failed to deliver on regeneration schemes for Dublin.  Last week, the assigned property developer pulled out of the Croke Villas public private partnership, PPP, which was to build 30 much needed social housing units.  Already this year property developer Bernard McNamara walked away from five public private partnership projects leaving residents devastated.  The council lost &euro;5 million in the process and is now seeking to go ahead with only three of these five projects.  To add insult to injury, residents will be left in limbo until 2010 or 2011 when these projects are supposed to commence.  This is a serious blow to the residents concerned.  As I stated earlier, waiting lists are at a record high of 56,000 and will continue to increase in the current economic crisis.  It is the less well-off in society who are always the first to suffer in this situation.  The vulnerable are the ones, unfortunately, who are hit.</P>
        <P>The Government has failed to deliver on its affordable housing targets.  Under the programme for Government and the national development plan, 17,000 affordable units were to be delivered between 2007 and 2009.  In 2007, only 3,500 units were delivered.  In the first three months of 2008, only 976 houses were delivered.  Today, there are 6,500 people on Dublin City Council&rsquo;s affordable housing list and there are 732 people on Fingal County Council&rsquo;s housing list.  The Minister of State will be aware that a problem arises in respect of affordable houses, the cost of which are that of current market value, as a result of which people are refusing to accept them.</P>
        <P>Budget 2009 introduced schemes to assist first-time buyers.  Two schemes were announced, namely, the Government equity scheme and the home choice loan scheme.  The Government equity scheme provides for the Government acquiring a stake in a property based on market value, the equity stake being between 25% and 30% leaving the buyer highly vulnerable if market prices increase when the house is being sold.  This scheme, which is to replace the affordable housing scheme, is flawed.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s new home choice loan scheme will provide up to 92% of the market value of a new property purchased by first-time buyers unable to obtain a loan from banks.  This scheme encourages people to borrow up to seven times the value of their salary, leaving them open to becoming trapped in bad debts and negative equity.  Fine Gael has reservations about the Government&rsquo;s home choice loan scheme which amounts to a bail-out of developers <Col N="860"/>and could lure first-time buyers into negative equity as house prices continue to fall.  With house prices continually falling month by month, the Government&rsquo;s latest intervention in the property market could trap first-time buyers in negative equity and, eventually, bad debt.</P>
        <P>While we welcome any initiatives to assist first-time buyers this scheme would be better if provided when house prices stabilise.  The fact that it only applies in respect of new properties is a nod from the Minister for Finance to his friends in the construction industry.  If he truly had the interests of first-time buyers in mind, the scheme would be open to all properties.  The Government must return to the drawing board and design suitable, affordable housing schemes which favour buyers and not developers and the Government coffers.  The Government has failed to protect homeowners from sub-prime lenders.  In 2008, there was a surge in the number of repossession orders granted in the High Court.  In the current economic climate the threat of repossession is real and worrying for many persons with mortgages.  On 6 October seven of the nine repossession orders granted were sought by the sub-prime lender, Start Mortgages.  Between January and June this year 126 repossession orders were granted in the High Court and 81 in the Circuit Court.  Last year 465 repossession summonses were issued in the High Court compared to 311 in 2006.  It is clear, therefore, that the number of repossessions is on the increase and it is expected more repossession orders will flood the courts in January.  It is estimated that 15,000 people have taken out sub-prime mortgages in the past five years, yet the Government has done nothing to protect people from sub-prime lenders.  It was able to bail out the banks and developers but has ignored the ordinary mortgage payer.  For months sub-prime lenders have had a free-for-all and dragged people with mortgages into the courts while the regulator looked on.</P>
        <P>In January this year I called on the regulator to draft new industry guidelines on reckless mortgage lending and to create new penalties for mortgage professionals found guilty of reckless lending and deception.  I also asked for a report to be compiled on lending practices engaged in by the mortgage industry in order that those which undermined consumers&rsquo; rights cjould be identified and eliminated through better regulation.  Sadly, that call was ignored and we are seeing the results of the regulator&rsquo;s inaction.  He should be asked why he did not act.  Last week in the D&aacute;il the Taoiseach stated he would instruct the Minister of State with responsibility for housing to consult the regulator on the matter.  It is a case of attempting to close the stable door after the horse has bolted.  This month I called on all Irish banks to implement the six-month moratorium on foreclosures for homeowners announced by RBS.  What is needed is protection for all those affected and support for the many who are struggling with mortgage repayments.  It is high time the banks showed the same leniency towards mortgage payers as they have shown to property developers in recent times.</P>
        <P>The Government has failed to ensure rental properties are inspected and meet the required standard.  There are also significant problems in the rental market.  In 2006 only 3% of all rental properties were inspected.  Last month the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, stated measures to improve standards in rental accommodation would come into effect on 1 February 2009.  It is farcical that there is a phasing-in period for existing landlords of four years, although first-time lettings will be affected from 1 February.  We on this side of the House welcome these measures which include the provision of separate toilet facilities, piped water and fire safety measures in rented accommodation.  New standards are welcome but a four-year phasing-in period is ridiculous.  There are approximately 200,000 registered private tenancies in Ireland, yet in 2006 only 6,800 were inspected.  The increase in non-compliance fines of &euro;2,000 is negligible.  It is necessary to increase them to a level that will make landlords take the matter seriously.</P><Col N="861"/>
        <P Just="Left">Fine Gael has raised consistently the issue of property management companies, in respect of which we need regulation.  More than 500,000 people reside in apartment blocks and 4,600 property management companies are in operation, yet there is no legislation in place.  It is farcical that a regulator has been in place since July 2006 but he has no statutory powers to take action against rogue property management companies and agents which operate in the market.  They do not offer value for money to hard pressed property owners who already face negative equity and the added burden of exorbitant property management fees.  The lack of regulation is a big failure on the part of the Government.  The matter needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>I am extremely concerned about the lack of inspection of apartment complexes in terms of fire safety measures.  A recent fire in an apartment complex in my constituency gave rise to many issues.  It emerged that fire drills did not take place on a regular basis and that there was no fire safety equipment in the complex.  In addition, fire brigade personnel could not gain entry to the building as it was a gated development.  They had to rely on an apartment owner to gain access.  The fire service should be able to gain access to apartment complexes.</P>
        <P>The Government has failed to deliver on housing.  We have a major social housing waiting list of 56,000.  That failure can be laid at the door of the Minister of State and the Government which has mismanaged the economy and squandered a great deal of money in areas where it should not have.  It should seek to provide at least 15,000 houses and have a realistic target to help those on housing waiting lists.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>This Private Members&rsquo; motion deals with the shambles local authorities face in housing.  The Government is clearly responsible for how it has squandered money in the past ten years which has led to the neglect of the social housing sector.  There is no possibility of the problem being addressed in the current economic climate, given that the Government was not able to address it in the previous ten good years.  The Minister of State referred to turkeys at Christmas but the chickens are coming home to roost for the Government.  He should not have been so critical of the motion tabled by the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in, as it is vital to discuss the serious housing problem we are facing.  I do not know who wrote the speech the Minister of State had to read.  He is a decent man but what he outlined does not tally with the situation faced by local authorities.</P>
        <P>I am familiar with the figures for County Galway and Galway city and I am sure the picture is the same nationally.  In County Galway, for example, 1,800 people are on the social housing waiting list and 550 on the affordable housing waiting list, giving a total of 2,350.  Last year 175 social and affordable houses were provided and the total provided so far this year is only 116.  If we continue at that level, even if nobody else is added to the housing list, it will take up to 20 years to clear the housing waiting lists in County Galway.  That is a fact which contradicts some of the statistics given by the Minister of State.  I will have to study his figures carefully, as I do not see how they measure up.</P>
        <P>In Galway city there are 2,285 people on the social housing waiting list and 350 on the affordable housing waiting list, giving a total of 2,735.  Last year 167 houses were allocated and fewer will be allocated this year.  At this rate, taking the figures for the past two years to form an average, if nobody else is added to the social and affordable housing waiting lists, it will take at least 15 years to clear the current housing waiting lists in Galway city.  While I accept the Minister of State has only been responsible for the matter since his appointment, his predecessors are responsible for the past ten years of neglect.</P><Col N="862"/>
        <P>Based on what the Minister of State outlined and in spite of the figures I quoted, the Government will do nothing to address the matter, apart from allocating less money to local authorities next year.  The sad reality is that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of completed new houses in Galway city and county that lie idle but local authorities have not been provided with sufficient funding to buy even one house.  As the Minister of State knows, those houses are now better value than what the local authority could provide them for.  The solution to the problem is to release money to housing sections of the local authorities.  I have in mind Galway, but this applies to the whole country.  Even if they bought only a few from the developers who have completed the houses, it would regenerate the finances in the local area.  The builder would be able to pay off his or her suppliers, plasterers, carpenters and so on.  That, in turn, would create a more vibrant local economy.  The Minister of State will never have as good a value again as he can get now in housing.</P>
        <P>There are people in my city and county being threatened with court action because they have not been able to pay the development charges.  They have offered the local authority an apartment or house in lieu of the development charges.  The local authority is unable to take up the offer of that apartment or house at very good value because it has no finance available to it.  I appeal to the Minister of State to look into that aspect and help to alleviate the hardship as reflected in the housing statistics for Galway city and county.</P>
        <P>The cutback in funding for housing repairs reflects another sorry state the Government has got us into.  There is a pretence that grants are available for housing repairs.  Formerly, grants were available under three headings for housing repairs: special housing aid for the elderly, which is dealt with by the HSE; essential repairs grants, which allowed elderly people, often living alone, to repair a house; and disabled person&rsquo;s grant, now known as the house adaptation grant.  The HSE and one local authority in my area have not taken applications for the past four months.  People are being pushed from Billy to Jack, under the pretence that they will be assessed for grants, and nothing happens.  In some cases, people whose grant applications were approved, borrowed the money to repair the house or install a downstairs bathroom for an invalid, and now neither the local authority nor the HSE has the money to pay the grant.  The Minister of State must take a serious look at housing grants as well in considering this motion.</P>
        <P>Included in the motion and referred to by my colleague, Deputy Terence Flanagan, is the involvement of management companies in apartment blocks and housing estates throughout the country.  I have raised this with the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessors for the past four or five years.  I have raised it on the Adjournment and other people, too, have asked questions, but yet nothing has been done.  More than a year ago, the current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government told me that within a week he would have a report from the working group he had set up, on proposed action in respect of management companies.  No legislation has been introduced and people are suffering on housing estates and in apartment blocks because of management companies over which they have no control.  I drew the Minister&rsquo;s attention at the time to the fact that both of the Galway local authorities were inserting conditions into planning permission, ensuring that management companies would have to be set up.  Will the Minister of State, or whoever will reply to the debate tomorrow night, state whether the practice of local authorities inserting such conditions into planning permission has been eliminated?  I know, on the basis of information from previous Ministers, that the local authorities have received letters from apartment owners saying this practice must be discontinued.  However, it has continued long after the circulars were issued to the local authorities.</P>
        <P>When the Minister of State addresses this issue tomorrow night, will he deal with the facts about the waiting lists for houses and not just rely on a prepared script?  I have given him the facts.  I checked them today with both Galway local authorities.  Between Galway city and <Col N="863"/>county, there are 9,990 people on the waiting list, mostly for social housing but some for affordable housing.  Yet taking an average for this year and last both local authorities will only provide 317 accommodation units for those people.  That rate effectively indicates that it will be 15 or 16 years before the list is cleared in Galway.  Will the Minister of State deal with that fact and most importantly, release money to the local authorities so that they may acquire some of the very good value for money houses now on the market.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Some management companies set up by the developer or the builder of the estate are charging households anything from &euro;500 up to &euro;2,000.  I know of estates in Galway where there are only five or six houses, perfectly finished, and yet there is a management company in place.  I know of an estate with 32 houses, and one site is left vacant.  Builders will sometimes leave one house unfinished, so that the local authority may not take the estate in charge while waiting for the one house to be finished.  This is a ruse to keep the management company in place, despite the fact that the 31 other householders would be quite willing to run their own estate rather than paying &euro;800 or &euro;900 a year, or perhaps much more.  One sometimes finds the same directors in a management company as in the building firm that built the houses in the first place.</P>
        <P>When will the legislation be introduced that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government promised me on 15 October 2007?  He said he would have the report within a week and would then introduce the legislation.  That report is almost four years in gestation.  I raised the matter in 2005-06 to try to have something done about the crisis involving management companies.  Some householders signed contracts before they noticed the small print about management companies, and having sold their own houses, found themselves trapped because the necessary legislation had not been introduced to deal with the problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office for the opportunity to raise this important issue and I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Tony Killeen, to the House to reply to the debate.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to dwell too much on the merits of the installation aid scheme for the purposes of this debate, as they are already well documented.  However, I would like to put on <Col N="864"/>the record the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&rsquo;s constant refrain in respect of the decision to suspend the schemes on budget day.  He said he regretted that and that when financial circumstances would permit, he hoped to be in a position to reintroduce the schemes.</P>
        <P>I wish tonight to draw attention to the installation aid scheme in particular, because there is some confusion in that regard.  This confusion arises in particular from an article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> of 6 December by my good colleague, that eminent agricultural correspondent Ray Ryan, the headline of which reads, &ldquo;Independent TD secures commitments on installation aid&rdquo;.  The article goes on to state that Deputy Michael Lowry secured some agreement regarding applications for the installation aid scheme which had been substantially progressed, but which had not been lodged within the Department by 14 October, budget day.  I would like clarification on the agreement made with Deputy Lowry.</P>
        <P>I raised the same matter on 3 December as a priority question on Question Time, three days before the said article appeared in the <i>Irish Examiner.  </i>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said to me in reply:</P>
        <P LI="1">I have no plans at present to reopen the young farmers&rsquo; installation aid scheme and the early retirement scheme to new applications, but the limiting of the suspension of the scheme will be considered at the earliest opportunity, having regard to the budgetary situation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In response to further questions, the Minister went on to say:</P>
        <P LI="1">I have stated repeatedly in the House and in response to councillors, representatives of various farming organisations and in the media that it is my intention to revisit my decision to suspend entry to the schemes as soon as circumstances permit.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He went on to state:</P>
        <P LI="1">I understand that at times the delay in lodging applications may have been outside an applicant&rsquo;s power.  I am conscious of that but I do not want to mislead anybody.  I am not in a position at this time to say when we will be able to progress those particular applicants who had set out on the road to complete an application.  I assure Deputy Creed that those applicants will be the first to have their applications processed when it is possible to re-open the schemes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He concluded by stating: &ldquo;The scheme was suspended due to budgetary constraints and that remains the position&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Unless the Government has won the national lottery since the Minister went on the record, I have not seen a change in budgetary circumstances that would enable the Minister to live up to the commitments he made to reopen the scheme as soon as budgetary circumstances permitted.  Is there some kind of nod and wink politics going on between the Department and the Independent Deputies who prop up the Government, Deputy Lowry in Tipperary North  and Deputy Healy-Rae in Kerry South?  Has a sweetheart deal been arranged for would-be applicants for installation aid in those areas who have made substantial progress but who have not submitted the application form?  Are they being treated differently in north Tipperary than in the rest of the country?  Either Mr. Lowry or the Minister is telling porkies.  They cannot both be right.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State put on the record tonight whether the installation aid scheme is back up and running?  The IFA has sent the Department a list of approximately 500 applicants who are in these circumstances, but those applicants are in areas from Malin Head to Mizen Head, some in my constituency.  Will the Government treat them differently because they do not live in north Tipperary?  I want and hope the Minister of State will clearly state the scheme is back up and running and open for business.</P><Col N="865"/>
        <P>The scheme has a value significantly in excess of the &euro;15,000 installation aid grant because it sends a signal to an industry crying out for new blood that encourages new thinking and highly trained qualified farmers at this critical time in the agricultural industry.  Is the Minister holding his ground or has he yielded?  If he has yielded, he cannot yield exclusively to north Tipperary.  It must be a concession that is available to every would-be applicant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate.</P>
        <P>Ireland is currently experiencing a period of economic turbulence, stemming from both international and domestic factors, and the context for this year&rsquo;s budget differed considerably from the majority of those of the past 15 years.  The priority in preparing the 2009 Estimates for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector.  The 2009 Estimates provide over &euro;1.8 billion for the Department.  This, when combined with EU funding of &euro;1.4 billion, means that total expenditure in 2009 will amount to over &euro;3.2 billion.  Even with a provision on that scale, however, difficult choices had to be made between competing demands.  It was in these circumstances that it was necessary to suspend the young farmers&rsquo; installation aid scheme and the early retirement from farming scheme for new applicants.</P>
        <P>The young farmers&rsquo; installation aid scheme was introduced in June 2007 under the aegis of the rural development programme for 2007-13.  It provided a higher grant level of &euro;15,000, an increase of 58%, to farmers between the ages of 18 and 35 years who set up in farming for the first time on or after 1 January 2007.  The principal requirements of the scheme were that applicants must generate a minimum of five production units from farming at the time of first setting up or within 12 months of that date; fulfil, within two years of first setting up on the farm the educational requirements of the scheme; submit and complete a business plan; obtain title or leasehold title to at least 15 hectares of eligible lands in less-favoured areas or 20 hectares in other areas; and have not more than &euro;50,000 in non-farm income in a designated tax year.</P>
        <P>Since the launch of the young farmers&rsquo; installation scheme in June 2007, some 941 applications have been received under the scheme and 357 payments made totalling &euro;5.355 million.  The Minister has confirmed on a number of previous occasions that all commitments entered into under the scheme, up to and including 14 October 2008, will be honoured by the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that even if they have passed the age of 35?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister has confirmed in the House previously, he is prepared to look at the possibility of reopening the scheme as soon as the general budgetary situation permits.  Young farmers whose applications were significantly progressed at the time the scheme was suspended are a priority.  In particular, eligible farmers who have continued their training will not be excluded from the benefits of the scheme when it reopens.</P>
        <P>As for the scheme of early retirement from farming, the Minister has also confirmed that whenever it becomes possible to reopen it to new applications, priority will be given to those who were making preparations to apply at the time it was suspended.  An allocation of &euro;56.7 million has been made in the Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2009 to meet current commitments under the two schemes.</P>
        <P>A number of farm tax measures were renewed in budget 2009.  These are part of a number of schemes and reliefs that have been put in place in recent years to bring about improvements in land mobility that will, in turn, improve productivity and efficiency, particularly for young <Col N="866"/>farmers.  These reliefs include the renewal of stamp duty relief for four years until 31 December 2012, worth an estimated &euro;53 million in a full year; the renewal of stamp duty relief for farm consolidation for two years from 1 July 2009 to 31 June 2011; the renewal of both the general and the young trained farmers rates of stock relief for a further two years, at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of &euro;2 million in a full year; and the extension of the accelerated capital allowance for necessary farm pollution control facilities from 31 December 2008 to the 31 December 2010, worth an estimated &euro;10 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>When combined, these farm tax measures are estimated to be worth over &euro;65 million in a full year.  In addition, the top rate of stamp duty on agricultural land transactions was reduced, with effect from 15 October last.  This should reduce the cost of agricultural land to purchasers and encourage a higher number of transactions.  All these measures should help young farmers to improve land mobility, increase land swaps and attain higher environmental standards.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to address the House on this very important matter.</P>
        <P>In the discussion on education that followed the budget, one area was not addressed when cutbacks were announced, namely, the youth affairs budget.  There is a broad consensus across this House that the work in youth services done by the many voluntary organisations throughout this country is money well spent.  Every year a very small sum of money in the budget is directed towards these organisations yet they still provide extraordinary opportunities for young people to participate in society.  This is particularly the case for young people who fall out of the education system, those who do not complete their leaving certificate.  Many of these projects are an essential means of their remaining within the informal education sector, as the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, is well aware.  There is cross-party consensus about the need to build capacity within this informal education sector which has been built up over recent years.</P>
        <P>With a great sense of alarm and concern, I must inform the House of the very savage cutbacks that have taken root in the Department of Education and Science.  The budget Estimate of &euro;43.7 million for the youth affairs area is proposed to be cut back to &euro;39.4 million in 2009.  What we see as a result of the cutbacks in the Department is, effectively, a cut in the order of 10%.  This will cause havoc and will make an already difficult situation much worse.  These cutbacks will affect very many organisations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>A complication is that the youth affairs section of the Department appears to have been shunted from Marlborough Street across to the Minister of State for Children and Youth Affairs.  As a result of this shunting operation, the budget has fallen between two stools.  A budget that was ring-fenced within the Department of Education and Science now falls between two Departments and is effectively lost.  Nobody is standing up for this sector.  The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, will be aware of this more than anybody else because he knows from his own constituency, as I do from mine, the importance of many of these projects.  I refer to the 180 special projects for youth affairs around the country.  These 180 organisations help directly the most vulnerable children in our communities and they will suffer a 10% cut in their main line budget next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Shame.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I put it to the Minister of State that this 10% cutback across the board may see many of these 180 special projects going to the wall.  That cannot be allowed to happen <Col N="867"/>under any circumstances but this budget, allegedly, was supposed to safeguard the front line and the most vulnerable children.  Will the Minister of State agree to meet urgently with the National Youth Council of Ireland?  The NYCI is the umbrella organisation for all the other good organisations throughout the country.  The Minister of State might explain to the NYCI how, exactly, the budget for 2009 is to be constructed and, more important, how it will affect the 180 different organisations.</P>
        <P>There may well be an argument that some national bodies can provide some of the required savings.  The Minister of State, more than anybody, would be prepared to dialogue with those national organisations.  I ask him to sit down over the course of the next few weeks with the NYCI in order to see if an agreement can be found to safeguard these 180 organisations that help the most vulnerable children of all in our constituencies.</P>
        <P>There is also a need to ensure that the organisations that run these services can know their budget for 2009 as expeditiously as possible.  Last year many of them were not given a budget until well into the summer months when half of their service had already been provided.  That was a scandal and is no way to treat the youth service.  In good times or bad, there is cross-party consensus that these organisations must be supported.  Unfortunately, this budget falls between two stools because neither the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, nor the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Andrews, takes responsibility for the youth service budget.</P>

	<P>I take this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews.  I make it quite clear that, since the formation of this Government, I do not have responsibility for youth affairs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the areas of responsibility within the Department of Education and Science is the support and development of the youth work sector in Ireland.  Responsibility for the youth work sector is now being transferred to the Office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs.  The overall purpose of the youth work service is to assist young people to realise their full potential and to become active participants in a democratic society.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious of the great benefits that can accrue to our young people from involvement in youth work and of the benefits for society as a whole.  I am also aware that this recognition requires appropriate support.  Through the youth affairs section of the Department, work has been ongoing with the National Youth Council of Ireland, the National Youth Work Advisory Committee, which includes representatives of other Departments, the vocational education committees and other interested parties to support youth work activities.  This support is provided by way of financial and other assistance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Youth work programmes and services are provided primarily by voluntary youth work organisations.  In this regard, a range of financial supports for the sector includes support for projects for disadvantaged young people under the special projects for youth scheme, to national youth organisations under the youth service grant scheme, to a network of youth information centres and to local clubs and groups throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Over 50 voluntary youth organisations operate in Ireland, with a stated membership of 450,000.  More than 40,000 voluntary youth leaders are the main educators, with support from approximately 1,000 full-time staff.  These organisations and their young members are represented and supported in their work by the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The council is pivotal to the provision and development of youth work in Ireland and the dedication and commitment of its staff to member and affiliate organisations is widely recognised.</P><Col N="868"/>
        <P>The programmes operated by the voluntary youth work organisations vary widely and include outdoor pursuits, arts, recreation, project work and international exchanges.  Qualities and skills such as leadership, co-operation, decision making, motivation and self responsibility are acquired by young people through this non-formal learning process.</P>
        <P>The youth work sector has received unprecedented financial support over the past number of years.  Youth services funding by the Department of Education and Science expanded from &euro;35.5 million in 2004 to &euro;56.6 million in 2008.  Although this funding has allowed for some expansion in the sector, there has been a growing emphasis on consolidation of services.</P>
        <P>The 2009 budget allocation for youth services from the Department of Education and Science is &euro;48.2 million, a decrease of 8% on the 2008 figure.  Funding is also provided for youth services from a number of other Departments and agencies.  The reduced allocation in the youth budget from the Department of Education and Science will require much tighter budget management and prioritisation which may impact on pay and administration costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State can sing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Department officials have met with representatives of the youth sector, including the National Youth Council of Ireland, to ascertain the sector&rsquo;s views on how best to minimise the impact of budgetary constraints next year with a view to consolidating, in so far as is practicable, the progress made in recent years.  The Department has also written to the national youth organisations and vocational education committees advising them to revisit their level of expenditure to determine where cost savings can be achieved, bearing in mind the budgetary constraints in 2009.</P>
        <P>Consideration is being given to how best to apply the budgetary constraints to the bodies and activities currently being supported.  Consideration will be given to all the programmes and initiatives supported in determining the levels of provision deemed appropriate in the context of the 2009 budget allocation.  I assure the Deputy that ongoing contact with the youth sector organisations, including the National Youth Council of Ireland, will continue and that we will endeavour to work constructively and co-operatively with the sector in meeting the challenges that lie ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State with responsibility in this area.  I am raising this issue on behalf of 11 children attending Cloverhill national school.  I first raised this issue with the Minister of State last August and highlighted that these children could not attend primary school in the town of Roscommon as there was physically no space for them.  The schools in the town have stated to some of the parents that there is up to a three-year waiting list.</P>
        <P>As a result, the parents of the 11 children residing in the town of Roscommon enrolled them in Cloverhill national school.  The Minister of State responded to my representations in regard to each case stating that the child is &ldquo;not basically eligible for transport under the terms of the scheme as the child is not attending their nearest school&rdquo;.  However, the children cannot attend the nearest school because there is no capacity and, as a result, they have been refused admission.  It is due to this fact that the parents are seeking the provision of school transport to Cloverhill national school.</P>
        <P>The Minister has reiterated the response that the pupils are not eligible as they reside less than 3.2 km from the nearest school and he would argue that the school transport system was basically designed to cater for children in rural areas who, if living a long distance from school, might have difficulty in attending regularly.  However, if children in urban areas require trans<Col N="869"/>port and the school they attend is the nearest school available to them and happens to be in a rural community, why cannot the system provide a service in the opposite direction, particularly if the primary purpose and objective is to facilitate regular attendance in school?</P>
        <P>The Minister has stated that while it is the prerogative of parents to send their children to a school of their choice, it is not the objective of the school transport scheme to facilitate this choice.  In this case, the parents have no choice because the nearest school is unavailable to them and the second-nearest school is also unavailable.  The nearest available school is the one they are now attending.  However, they cannot enrol in that school, so the decision of the Minister has been pointless to date.</P>
        <P>While the Department claims there is no provision under the terms of the school transport scheme to provide transport in these circumstances, at present under the school transport rules the 3.2 km distance to the nearest school does not apply to a child who wishes to be taught through the medium of Irish, once the child is 3.2 km from a Gaelscoil.  It is also the case that this rule does not apply to a child with a physical disability where the school cannot physically cater for the pupil.  For example, if there are stairs in the school and no lifts, and the child is in a wheelchair, then the school is not determined as the nearest school for school transport purposes.</P>
        <P>This is also the case with these 11 children.  The nearest school cannot physically cater for the pupils.  They urgently require daily transport to and from Cloverhill national school.  Some of the pupils have already missed up to ten days attendance at the school because their parents do not have transport or are working away from home and, as a result, are unable to transport the pupils up to 7 km to school.</P>
        <P>These children need to attend school and they have the right to do so.  Eight of the families are already marginalised and disadvantaged at many levels &mdash; culturally, linguistically and economically.   By not providing school transport, we are to deprive them further despite the examples I have given regarding the flexibility of the school transport service and the fact the nearest school cannot physically cater for them.  The families have received written refusals from the principals of the local schools.  The parents have no other choice but to bring them up to 7 km to the next nearest school, Cloverhill national school, which provides an excellent service with which the parents are very satisfied.  However, children are losing out on attendance because they physically cannot get to school on occasion.  It is not an acceptable situation.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State is aware, the vast majority of these pupils are migrants.  They already have significant challenges to integrate within our community and additional barriers should not be put in front of them.  I urge the Government to reconsider this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to outline to the House my Department&rsquo;s position regarding school transport to Cloverhill national school, County Roscommon.  By way of general comment, I should explain that one of the main objectives of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for pupils who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.  In order to be eligible for transport under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, pupils must reside 3.2 km or more from, and be attending, their nearest national school, as determined by the Department.  While it is the prerogative of parents to send their children to the school of their choice, it is not the objective of the school transport scheme to facilitate that choice.</P>
        <P>In August 2008, the Deputy informed my Department that a particular constituent was seeking the provision of school transport for her son to Cloverhill national school due to the lack of capacity in the local schools.  The Department referred the case to Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport scheme, to establish whether the pupil met the criteria for eligibility on distance grounds.  According to Bus &Eacute;ireann, the child resides 1.4 km from the nearest school and 7.1 km from Cloverhill national school.  The child is, therefore, not eligible for <Col N="870"/>transport.  Bus &Eacute;ireann further advised that there is no service to either school from the area.  The Department has already informed the Deputy that there is no provision in the school transport scheme to provide transport in the circumstances outlined by him.</P>
        <P>While it is understood from the Deputy that school transport is required to Cloverhill national school due to capacity issues in the school nearest to the child&rsquo;s place of residence, the question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools.  My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act.  In this regard, a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group, or occasionally on the basis of some other criterion.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Under section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure, as regards that policy, that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents&rsquo; choice are respected.  Section 29 of that Act provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of the Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.  Following the determination of any such appeal, and in the event of the child being unable to secure an enrolment at the local school, the Department may review the procedures regarding the provision of school transport.</P>

      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Last Wednesday the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, was in the House when I raised a matter relating to Mercy College, Woodford, County Galway and the affects on that school of the cutbacks announced in the budget.  Yesterday, Deputy Noel Treacy and I attended a meeting of the board of management, parent representatives and staff of the school.  They outlined in detail the effects of the withdrawal of disadvantaged status.  As a result of this measure, 3.81 teachers will be lost, which represents almost 25% of the total school staff quota.  The withdrawal of special status together with the financial loss of nearly &euro;10,000 will have devastating results in this small school of approximately 230 students.</P>
        <P>The school is a small, stand-alone, co-educational school in south-east Galway in a CL&Aacute;R programme area, where 41% of the parents do not have any formal or primary school education.  Only 13% of students from the school proceed to third level education.  The school has taken many children with disadvantages and special needs through to junior and leaving certificate level, and some of these have continued to third level.  Will the Minister for Education and Science re-examine the effects of these cutbacks on the school?  I believe if the cutbacks proceed as intended, they will threaten the very existence of the school.</P>
        <P>I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to a decision in 2006 to withdraw the disadvantaged status from the school.  This was later reversed by the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  The school was allowed to retain some staff, as well as the home school liaison person.  It was vital that the school retained such assistance and the financial support. <Col N="871"/> Will the Minister of State bring to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science the message that this school should retain its status for the lifetime of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, action plan, which was the intention of the reversal of the original decision in 2006?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague, Deputy Burke, and I endorse his comments.  We come from the constituency of Galway East where there are both urban and rural disadvantaged areas.  The only positive aspect of an urban disadvantaged area is that the affected children have a choice of schools and some opportunity.  However, in a rurally disadvantaged area there is no such choice and only one school.  This is especially the case in mid and south County Galway along the Slieve Aughty mountain range and near the border with County Clare.  In this area only one third of the population is employed and two thirds are unemployed.  There is an outstanding school with an outstanding, positive attitude to all children.  There are 30 special needs children in the school population.  There is in place a whole school evaluation and performance system which also addresses the curriculum and subject choices.  I appeal to the Minister for Education and Science to allow for the continuation <i>ad infinitum</i> of the DEIS programme, in line with the Departmental circular of May 2007.</P>
        <P>Mercy College, Woodford is in a critical location.  If there is to be any diminution of the services there will be a serious reduction in the numbers attending second level education, resulting in difficulties and social disadvantages.  This will compound the existing situation, whereby the people are already playing against the wind and require every possible State support.  These are necessary to sustain this outstanding centre of educational excellence in South Galway, an area which Deputy Burke and I are proud to represent and support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We depend on the Minister of State and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  We realise the Department will treat each school on a case-by-case basis and take into account the mix of students, the disadvantages and the fact that the school population is multicultural.  There were people of many nationalities living in the parish before the advent of the Celtic tiger.  We appeal to the Minister of State to ensure the school receives special attention and that the provision of specialist supports continues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Deputies on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the increase of &euro;302 million in the education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, several tough and difficult decisions had to be taken in framing the 2009 budget.  These decisions were taken to control expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long term.  In this respect education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding restrictions several areas, including at school level.  However, these are the inevitable result of the current challenging economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources prudently.</P>
        <P>The DEIS plan for educational inclusion provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated school support programme.  DEIS brings together and builds upon a number of interventions in schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage.  There are 876 schools in the DEIS plan.  These comprise 673 primary schools and 203 second-level schools.</P>
        <P>The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of the Department of Education and Science and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the inspectorate.  Some 73 post primary schools, 27 urban primary schools and 123 rural primary schools that were not identified for inclusion in DEIS retained resources, including teaching posts and <Col N="872"/>financial supports, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing educational disadvantage.</P>
        <P>When DEIS was introduced, a commitment was given, as a concessionary measure to these schools, that they would retain a level of support for the duration of the current DEIS initiative which is scheduled to end in 2010.  While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact on these schools, given the current challenging economic climate, the Department considered that it was prudent to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non-DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.</P>
        <P>The main focus of social inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools.  There is a need to target resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General, set out in his report on primary disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that the Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P>Taken in combination, the impact of the staffing schedule changes, as well as the withdrawal of historic DEIS posts and language support, weighed off against increases expected in the numbers of teachers for demographics and resource teachers for special needs, will mean an overall net reduction of 200 posts at primary and post primary levels.</P>
        <P>As the processing of the September 2008 enrolment returns for primary and post-primary schools is not yet finalised, it is not possible at this time to outline to the House the impact these changes will have on the allocation of mainstream teaching posts for the school year 2009-10.  This includes Mercy College, Woodford.  The Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way on staffing allocations for the school year 2009-10 and at that time, a more accurate indication of the mainstream staffing levels will be available.</P>
        <P>The allocation processes include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  This is particularly relevant at post-primary level where the appellate process especially considers any specific curricular needs of the school concerned.  At primary level, the normal redeployment arrangements apply.  However, at post-primary there is no effective system-wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools retain teachers, though over quota.  I remind the Deputies that the ceiling of two on the number of language support teachers per school is being re-imposed, with some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is sufficient concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall pupil enrolment.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Deputies for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the current position here.</P>

	<P>As I have already indicated, I accept fully the expert advice provided to me in support of the introduction of a cervical cancer vaccination programme.  However, I also have a responsibility as Minister to consider this and many other competing priorities within the overall resources available to the health services.  My immediate responsibility in relation to cervical cancer is to women who have already been exposed to HPV and who may already have precancerous changes or undetected cervical cancer.  Vaccination is a long-term investment which will deliver improved health outcomes and treatment savings in 15 to 30 years.  All of the clinical advice available to me indicates that the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme should be my number one priority.  The National Cervical Screening Programme, CervicalCheck, is being implemented with effect from September of this year.  The full year cost of this programme is &euro;35m. </P>
        <P>In relation to the cost of the vaccine, it is a matter for the Health Service Executive to go through the normal procurement procedures to select an appropriate supplier who can make the vaccine available at the most advantageous price.  The actual purchase price in Ireland can only be established when the HSE has completed the procurement process.  I have no role in the procurement process.</P>
        <P>I am fully committed to keeping the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme under active review as we proceed to implement the National Cancer Programme.</P>

	<P>I have identified the development of neurology services as a policy priority for some time.  I allocated additional revenue funding of &euro;7m to the HSE in 2006 and 2007 for the development of services in the area of neurosciences, which comprises neurology, neurophysiology and neurosurgery.   </P>
        <P>This investment has helped to increase substantially the number of approved consultant neurology posts.  There are now 24 such posts, an increase of 10 since 2003.  In addition, there are currently 7 approved consultant clinical neurophysiologist posts, an increase of 4 approved posts since 2003.  The HSE has set aside extra revenue funding of &euro;850,000 in 2009 to support the further development of neurosciences.</P>
        <P>The HSE has undertaken a national review of Neurology Services to improve integration of services and optimise patient outcomes.  It took particular account of likely future levels of demand and rapid technological advances in the area. The review was completed some time ago and submitted to the National Hospitals Office.  Following consideration of the report, the HSE decided to seek an external expert opinion on the model of care proposed to ensure that the recommendations were properly aligned with the HSE Transformation Programme.  The expert panel expects to conclude its work within the next three months after which time the HSE can proceed to the implementation phase and arrange for publication.</P>

	<P>Clinical nutritional products cost the HSE &euro;46 million a year, over &euro;27 million of which is spent on oral nutritional products.  Clinical nutritional products include oral nutritional supplements as well as tube feeds, products for metabolic conditions and gluten free foods.  The types of oral nutritional supplements most commonly prescribed in the community are ready-made drinks called &lsquo;sip feeds&rsquo;.  Audits suggest that up to 50% of prescribed oral nutritional supplements may not be consumed by patients.</P>
        <P>The HSE are taking steps to reduce the wastage and inappropriate prescribing of these products while ensuring that patients can access them as required.  Savings of &euro;10 million are expected in 2009; &euro;7 million by reducing wastage and inappropriate prescribing and &euro;3 million from competitive tendering arrangements for agreed non-drug items where appropriate.</P>
        <P>An initial guidance document has been developed by the HSE and will be circulated in January to prescribers.  The HSE will develop a more substantial information pack early in the new year.  Further educational initiatives are anticipated in 2009.</P>
        <P>The HSE met separately with both the professional body of dieticians, the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute, and representatives of the human nutrition industry in the past fortnight.  The Executive will work with all relevant stakeholders in the coming months to develop a more substantive support pack for GPs, which will enable more targeting prescribing of these products in 2009.</P>

	<P>The 2009 budget for the National Cancer Screening Service is being considered at present and the question of funding for colorectal screening will be examined in that context.</P>
        <P>The Service established an Expert Group on Colorectal Screening to prepare advice on the introduction of a national colorectal cancer programme, specifically on the population to be screened, at what intervals screening should take place, the type of test required and the requirements for a quality assured and well organised cost effective symptomatic service.  The report of the Expert Group was submitted to me last week.</P>
        <P>The Service has also requested the Health Information &amp; Quality Authority to conduct a Health Technology Assessment on a colorectal screening programme. I expect this to be completed early next year, at which stage I will consider the matter further.</P>

        <Quest> if she is satisfied that the new consultants&rsquo; contract sufficiently deals with issues of consultant work practices in co-located hospitals or if she expects that the contract will have to be renegotiated to deal with this; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that new contractual arrangements for medical consultants were agreed with their representative organisations earlier this year following more than four years of protracted negotiations.  I am satisfied with the provisions in the contract dealing with consultants working in co-located hospitals and I have no plans to renegotiate any aspect of the contract.  However, in accordance with the recommendation of Mr Mark Connaughton SC, independent chairman of the consultant contract talks, discussions will take place between health service employers and the consultants representative organisations on the practical issues arising from co-location, when appropriate. </P>
        <P>The entitlement of consultants to engage in private practice in co-located hospitals is dependent on their contract type.  Consultants with Type A contracts will not engage in any private practice.  Consultants who hold types B, B* and C contracts may engage in private practice in co-located hospitals up to a maximum of 20% of total clinical throughput (30% for existing consultants).</P>
        <P>Under the contract the ratio of public to private practice will be implemented through the Clinical Directorate structure and the implementation of this ratio will be the subject of audit, including audit by my Department.</P>
        <P>Clinical Directors will have a pivotal role in monitoring compliance by individual consultants with the ratio of public to private practice stipulated in their contracts, taking corrective action if the private practice limit is being exceeded.</P>
        <P>The new contract also provides for the introduction of Clinical Directorate Service Plans.  These will cover the organisation and delivery of front-line services and will incorporate indi<Col N="876"/>vidual consultant&rsquo;s work schedules.  In developing the Directorate Service Plan, the Clinical Director will determine the monthly work schedule for consultants and how each consultant&rsquo;s commitment will be discharged to achieve the planned level of output.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In July of this year the Government decided that a targeted voluntary redundancy/early retirement scheme would be introduced for the HSE.  This was reaffirmed by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement of 14 October. </P>
        <P>More recently, on Wednesday 26 November, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance announced a series of measures aimed at transforming the public service.  These included the establishment of a Special Group on Public Sector Numbers and Expenditure.  One of the core objectives of this Group will be to identify and report on the scope for reducing public service numbers.  The Group is to report regularly to the Minister for Finance with a final report due by end-June 2009.</P>
        <P>I have previously made it clear that a managed voluntary redundancy scheme will have an important role to play in helping to improve the delivery of health services to patients by streamlining management and administration within the HSE.</P>
        <P>The scheme will focus initially on surplus senior and middle management staff but will, as appropriate, be extended to other staff working in corporate, hospital and community services.</P>
        <P>It will, for example, support the development of shared services in functions such as financial, management, payroll, human resources and procurement.  It has been estimated by some of the Dublin hospitals that the elimination of duplication in areas such as these would lead to efficiencies of between 10% &mdash; 20% in administration costs.  The Task Force on the Public Service also highlighted the potential of shared services to improve both value for money and standards of service to the public.</P>
        <P>The development of primary care teams provides further opportunities to reduce the levels of administration and to facilitate more clinician to clinician engagement about the care of patients.</P>
        <P>Work in ongoing at present within the HSE, my Department and the Department of Finance to examine the parameters of a voluntary redundancy scheme/early retirement scheme.  This will include a business case for the numbers and grades to be covered along with an indication of its expected scale and timing.</P>

        <P>I would emphasise, however, that implementation of the recommendations in A Vision for Change is dependent to a much greater extent on the remodelling of existing resources than on new additional funds.</P>
        <P>Instead of focusing on inputs, such as extra funding and extra staff, we need to concentrate on making better use of the existing resources being devoted to health services, including mental health services.  We need to define the type of outcomes we want to achieve such as achieving the best possible recovery for individuals with mental health problems.  We then need to identify the outputs which will best deliver these outcomes such as more community based mental health services which build on the supports available from family and friends.  It is against this background that A Vision for Change recommends, for example, the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and the reinvestment of the resources released by these closures in community mental health services.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to work with the HSE to provide the best possible services to people with mental health problems within whatever resources are made available by the Government each year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive is constantly working to ensure that sufficient bed capacity is available in the acute hospital system.</P>
        <P>Findings from a recent second National Bed Utilisation Review indicate some improvements with regard to bed utilisation in hospitals during 2008.  However, there is still significant scope to improve the way in which beds in the acute hospital system are managed.  The Review shows a slight reduction in the number of patients admitted who could have been cared for elsewhere (13% down to 12%).  There has been a more significant reduction in the number who could have been cared for in an alternative care setting (down from 39% to 34%). There has been a significant increase reported in the number of elective surgical patients admitted on the day of surgery (up from 25% to 41%).  While there was an 8% increase in evidence of discharge planning, there has been no change in predicted dates of discharge.</P><Col N="879"/>
        <P>Hospitals need to improve their admission and discharge processes to ensure that people are appropriately admitted and that their care is efficiently managed both during their hospital stay and their follow up care in the community.  Each patient should have an expected date of discharge within 24 hours of admission, patients need to be discharged in a more proactive manner at weekends and communication between the hospital system and primary care services needs to be improved.  These measures are reflected in a new Code of Practice on Discharge Planning which has been issued by the HSE with a view to effecting further improvements in overall bed utilisation.</P>
        <P>As part of the HSE Winter Initiative, hospital managers have been asked to develop an action plan to reduce the average length of stay in hospital of patients, based on the findings of the Bed Utilisation Study and to increase the rate of day surgery in line with best international practice.</P>
        <P>The HSE is also increasing long-stay capacity to free up beds in acute hospitals over the Winter period.  By the end of this year, 279 additional long-stay beds will have been made available to patients.  A further 503 new long-stay beds will be provided in 2009. In addition, in early 2009 the HSE will provide 245 additional contract beds to alleviate delayed discharges pressure on the acute hospital system.</P>

A number of the Report&rsquo;s <Col N="880"/>recommendations relating to matters such as the hospital consultants&rsquo; contract, the HSE&rsquo;s utilisation of assets and its financial management systems are already the subject of action by my Department, the HSE or other relevant bodies.  The other recommendations will be the subject of examination and follow-up as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Report commented on certain aspects of the operation of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), including value for money.  The Fund compares the prices which it pays with treatment costs in public hospitals and, where known, the prices being paid by health insurers to private hospitals.  The financial statements of the Fund are subject to audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) on an annual basis.  The Committee of Public Accounts noted that the C&amp;AG has access to information (which cannot be disclosed publicly because it is commercially sensitive) about the prices paid by the NTPF for procedures undertaken in private hospitals.  The Committee noted also that the C&amp;AG has agreed to carry out a review of these areas as part of his continuing audit of the NTPF&rsquo;s expenditure.</P>
        <P>I am committed to ensuring that the NTPF achieves maximum value for money so that as many public patients as possible can benefit from treatment through the Fund.  This issue will therefore continue to be the subject of attention in the context of my Department&rsquo;s oversight and monitoring role in relation to the NTPF.</P>

	<P>There have been no changes to the operation of the Long-Term Illness (LTI) Scheme.  Under the scheme, people with one or more of a list of specified long-term illnesses are entitled to obtain, without charge, and irrespective of income, necessary medicines and/or appliances for the treatment of that illness. </P>
        <P>Some people who are eligible for the Long-Term Illness Scheme also hold a medical card, which means that they are entitled to access all their medications free of charge rather than just those required for the treatment of the long-term illness. In these instances, patients are expected to use the most cost-efficient way to access their medication needs, i.e. on a GMS prescription.  Medication obtained with a GMS prescription is reimbursed by the HSE at the ingredient cost plus a dispensing fee, whereas medication obtained with an LTI prescription is reimbursed at the ingredient cost plus a 50% retail markup.</P>
        <P>A GMS prescription can be repeated for a period of three months.  Medical card holders do not incur any cost by returning to the GP for a new prescription, if necessary, every three months.  As GPs are paid an annual capitation fee for medical card patients, no additional cost is incurred by the HSE.</P>
        <P>In the case of persons eligible under the LTI scheme who do not hold a medical card, any prescription by their GP remains valid for a maximum of six months.</P>

	<P>The immediate focus of the North East Transformation Programme is to have acute and complex care concentrated on two hospital sites and to ensure that services in the region are organised to optimise patient safety.   </P>
        <P>Planned changes include the transfer of acute in-patient services from Monaghan to Cavan and the development of additional services at Monaghan.  Specific measures need to be put in place prior to this transfer of acute care to Cavan General Hospital, including the establishment of a new Medical Assessment Unit at Cavan and significant enhancements to the ambulance and pre-hospital care service.  The transfer which is scheduled for early next year will be formally announced once various dependencies are in place.</P>
        <P>In Louth/Meath the immediate focus is on strengthening existing medical services, enhancing emergency department capacity, developing appropriate ambulance protocols, completing surgical reconfiguration, transferring acute services to Drogheda and providing additional community packages of care.  The sequence and timing of these changes is subject to detailed planning by the HSE and will require significant engagement and extensive communication with stakeholders.</P>

	<P>The Government decided in July 2005 that the best option for improving geographic access for patients in the North West to radiation oncology services in the short term was to facilitate access to Belfast City Hospital.  It also decided to explore the scope in the medium term for developing a joint venture based on a satellite centre in the North West linked to Belfast City Hospital.</P>
        <P>Cancer patients in the North West requiring radiation oncology treatment are referred to either St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin or University College Hospital Galway.  A Service Level Agreement is also in place for the referral of radiation oncology patients from Donegal to Belfast City Hospital.</P>
        <P>In April this year, Minister Michael McGimpsey of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSS&amp;PS), Northern Ireland announced the provision of a satellite centre (linked to Belfast City Hospital) to be located in Altnagelvin.  It will provide the additional radiotherapy capacity needed to meet an anticipated increase in cancer in Northern Ireland.  It also recognises the potential for cross border co-operation in the development of this resource.  Officials from my Department and their counterparts in Northern Ireland continue to hold discussions in this regard.  I understand that this facility is expected to be operational by 2015.</P>

	<P>In May 2007 the HSE commissioned KPMG consultants to undertake an independent review of maternity and gynaecology services in the Greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>KPMG were asked to focus on four key areas:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to build on the strengths of the current service configuration and model of care;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to define the optimal configuration of maternity, gynaecology and neonatology services for the Greater Dublin Area;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to identify the optimal location of services; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to provide a roadmap for the future, outlining the steps required to get from where the service is now to the vision for the future.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The review was informed by a detailed analysis of current service delivery, an extensive stakeholder interview programme and a series of workshops with a wide range of stakeholders.  It also included international analysis of maternity and gynaecology service configurations and best practice models of care.</P>
        <P>The Report was presented to the HSE Board for information on 13th November. The findings have also been presented to the Joint Standing Committee of the Dublin Maternity Hospitals and to the Chief Executive Officers of the Mater, St Vincent&rsquo;s and Tallaght Hospitals <Col N="883"/>in the context of the recommendation in the Report that services at the three existing maternity hospitals should transfer to these sites. Representatives from the HSE also met with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to discuss the findings of the Report.</P>
        <P>The HSE held a further feedback session recently with representatives of the maternity hospitals and the wider group of stakeholders who had engaged with KPMG during the review, including consumer groups.  The report will be published on the HSE website shortly.</P>

	<P>A core function of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is to set standards on safety and quality of health services and to monitor enforcement of those standards in an open and transparent way.  The Health Act 2007 gives HIQA strong powers in this area in relation to services provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and bodies funded by the HSE to provide services on their behalf.  The process by which such a regulatory regime is introduced first in the public sector is a feature of similar developments in other jurisdictions.    </P>
        <P>HIQA has developed National Quality Standards in areas such as: Symptomatic Breast Disease Standards, National Hygiene Standards and National Standards for Infection Prevention and Control and have commenced work on the development of National Quality Standards for acute hospitals in the public acute hospital sector.  In addition, there is already in existence extensive legislation governing the activities of healthcare professionals which includes those operating in the private sector.</P>
        <P>In January 2007, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring patient safety and quality in our health services, I established a Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that quality and safety of care for patients is paramount within the healthcare system.  The Commission&rsquo;s Report &mdash; &lsquo;Building a Culture of Patient Safety&rsquo; &mdash; was published in August 2008.</P>
        <P>The most significant recommendation of the report is the introduction of a licensing system for all health services providers both public and private and such a system should commence with application to the acute hospitals.  I am currently considering the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations in detail and I intend to bring the report, together with a proposed implementation strategy, to Government soon.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 195 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware that research on the range of conditions which may be treated by stem cells is gathering pace and offers promise for the future. I am also aware that the association referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question recognises cord blood as useful for some therapeutic purposes.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that the association in question does not recommend private banking of cord blood for low-risk families.</P>
        <P>Access for the Irish population to cord blood is principally mediated through a network of national and international stem cell banks and registries which is facilitated by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  These international banks, to which the Irish population have access, include stem cells sourced from cord blood.  In addition, &ldquo;directed&rdquo; harvesting of cord blood for medically indicated and predetermined use is facilitated in HSE hospitals in collaboration with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is licensed for this purpose by the relevant competent authority, the Irish Medicines Board, and procurement of stem cells taken on their behalf at HSE operated or funded hospitals is indemnified by the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Undirected&rdquo; harvesting of cord blood stem cells is harvesting of cord blood stem cells at the time of birth for potential use in the future which is undetermined at the time of harvesting, including potential future applications not currently established.  There is no public service for banking in this scenario.  However, there is one private company operating in the Irish market which is authorised to offer this service to members of the public.  While this company is licensed under appropriate legislation by the Irish Medicines Board for the procurement of stem cells, they may not themselves always undertake the actual procedure of harvesting the cord blood at the time of birth.  Instead they have approached staff employed at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE to enter into a private contract with the commercial company to undertake harvesting on behalf of the company.  The State Claims Agency, which provides an indemnity under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme to cover clinical risks in hospitals operated or funded by the HSE, considers that undirected harvesting does not come within the scope of the statutory definition of &ldquo;professional medical services&rdquo; as set out in the Order establishing the scheme.  Their statement on the matter is publicly available.</P>
        <P>At this point, the HSE has not issued a direction to hospitals or staff with regard to the undertaking of undirected harvesting of cord blood under contract with private companies.  However, in response to enquiries, the position of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme has been indicated to hospital or staff.</P>
        <P>The HSE is currently examining the issues surrounding the undirected harvesting of cord blood at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE to facilitate processing and banking by private companies under contract with patients.  It will be corresponding with hospitals once this examination is complete. At the heart of this examination is the need for the HSE to ensure that evidence-based, safe, effective and high quality care is provided to patients and their families.  However, it raises broader questions around the entry by staff employed at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE into private contracts with commercial companies to provide products or services not provided by the HSE itself.</P>

	<P>The aim of the acute hospital co-location initiative is to make available 1,000 additional public acute hospital beds for public patients by transferring private activity, with some limited exceptions, from public acute hospitals to co-located private hospitals. </P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made on the co-location initiative. The Board of the HSE has approved preferred bidder status for the development of co-located hospitals at Beaumont, Cork University, Limerick Regional, St James&rsquo;s, Sligo and Waterford Regional Hospitals. Project Agreements for the first four of these projects have been signed.  Planning permission was granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the Beaumont project in November 2008. The decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is awaited in the case of the Cork and Limerick projects, where planning has been granted and appealed.  An application for planning permission in respect of the St James&rsquo;s project is expected to be made shortly. Preparatory work in relation to the Project Agreements for the two remaining projects is proceeding.</P>
        <P>A tender in respect of Connolly Hospital has been received and is under consideration.  Work is being undertaken to finalise the Invitation to Tender (ITT) for Tallaght Hospital.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each of the successful bidders to arrange to finance the projects in accordance with the terms of the relevant Project Agreement. Although it is certainly the case that the funding environment has changed radically in the last six months, in relation to both public and private sectors, the co-location initiative like other major projects has to deal with this.  The successful bidders are working on the details of contractual terms with banks and other arrangers of finance in the very difficult and changed credit environment. I have not met the successful bidders to discuss the financing of the projects, as this is an operational matter. However the HSE is continuing to work with them to ensure that the co-located hospitals can be built and brought into operation as soon as possible, and that the goal of achieving new public acute bed capacity at value for money to the State is achieved.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Patients who require colonoscopies are prioritised on the basis of information about their symptoms provided by their GP.  Those where cancer is suspected are dealt with on an urgent basis.  Accordingly, longer waiting times apply only to patients in which an urgent clinical need has not been identified by their GP.</P>
        <P>Waiting times for colonoscopies have improved in the last 12 months but I accept there is need for further improvement.  In the year to November 2008, there has been a reduction of two thirds in the number of patients waiting for longer than 12 months, and a 31% reduction in the overall number of patients waiting longer than three months.  The pattern of lengthy waiting times is confined to a small number of hospitals.</P>
        <P>I have discussed this with the CEO of the HSE who last month instructed all hospitals where patients are waiting over three months for a colonoscopy to refer these patients to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  The NTPF has said that it will quickly arrange colonoscopies for patients who are referred to them and I expect to see a substantial improvement over a short period of time.</P><Col N="887"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 223 together.</P>
        <P>The National Disability Strategy, which was launched in September 2004, provides for a framework of new supports for people with disabilities. Among the principal elements of the Strategy are both the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004.</P>
        <P>The Disability Act 2005 remains the central component of the National Disability Strategy. Part 2 of the Act provides people with disabilities with an entitlement to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />an independent assessment of their health and education needs;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a statement of the services it is proposed to provide;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />pursue a complaint through the HSE complaints process if necessary;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 commenced for children aged under 5 years with effect from 1 June 2007. This prioritisation reflects the importance of intervention early in life, which can have a significant impact on the disabling effects of a condition or impairment. In addition, a number of sections of the EPSEN Act 2004 have also been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special needs. Unlike the Disability Act, the EPSEN Act does not provide for phased commencement by age cohort. Consequently, the education sector must be in a position to provide the required services to all children before the relevant provisions are commenced.</P>
        <P>At the end of November 2008, 3,508 applications for an assessment of need under the Disability Act 2005 have been received and have been completed or are in train by the HSE. This process will continue in respect of children under 5.</P>
        <P>It had been intended to have the EPSEN Act fully implemented by 2010, and to commence Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 for 5 to 18 year-olds in tandem and to extend the provisions to adults the following year. This would have required significant additional investment in 2009 and 2010 to prepare the education and health sectors for the operation of the legislation and to support the statutory processes that would be required.  In the light of the current financial circumstances, it is unfortunately necessary to defer the implementation of the above legislation.</P><Col N="888"/>
        <P>However, this does not in any way dilute the Government&rsquo;s commitment in the areas of disability and mental health. Deputies will be aware of the greatly increased funding base for disability and mental health services that has been built up over recent years. Additional monies amounting to more than &euro;550 million have been allocated to the HSE, under the Multi-Annual Investment Programme, to continue to enhance and develop services to people with disabilities and mental health difficulties.</P>
        <P>The Government further emphasised its commitment to children with disabilities by allocating an additional &euro;20 million in the recent Budget for health and education services for children with special educational needs. &euro;10 million of this allocation will be to the Health Service Executive for the provision of 125 additional therapy posts in the disability and mental health services, targeted at children of school-going age, and &euro;10 million to the Department of Education and Science, to enable the services provided to children with special educational needs to be enhanced and strengthened.</P>
        <P>The challenge facing us now is to use available resources to best effect in the period ahead. My Office for Disability and Mental Health will be actively working to improve coordination and cooperation between relevant Departments and agencies and to continue to achieve as much progress and service development as possible in the more constrained resource environment that now applies.</P>

	<P>I commenced further sections of the Pharmacy Act 2007 on 28th November 2008.  Among the sections commenced were those dealing with the setting up of a regulatory regime by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland for the registration of retail pharmacy businesses.  Each retail pharmacy business will now have to meet certain minimum criteria regarding the facilities, storage and sale of medicinal products on their premises.  Registration will be required on an annual basis and inspections can be carried out by the Society.  The Society, has been, and continues to be, a self-financing body.  These new functions will place additional costs on the Society and it is charging a fee of &euro;2,500 for the registration of pharmacy businesses. </P>
        <P>In arriving at a fee for retail pharmacy businesses, the Society engaged consultants to develop an evidence-based methodology for the determination of registration fees on a viable and sustainable self-financing basis.  The process included a comparative analysis of comparable international pharmacy regulators.  I am informed by the Society that the arrangements for registration in Northern Ireland and the UK are substantially different to what is being introduced here.  In particular, the range of duties of regulatory bodies in the UK, in terms of statutory obligations and their role in public safety, is not as extensive as those required of the Society under the Pharmacy Act 2007.  The UK is currently establishing an independent pharmacy regulator and once this regulator is in place, the situation in the UK in terms of regulation and funding of such, may change.</P>
        <P>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has undertaken to keep the fees for the registration of retail pharmacy businesses under review throughout 2009 and update me as to their appro<Col N="889"/>priate level when submitting its 2010 fee submission.  I would also point out that the main fees for registration of pharmacists and pharmaceutical assistants are not increasing for 2009.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health services possible in an effective and efficient way.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved. It is essential that we prioritise patient safety and quality and that we organise and manage services accordingly. The priority is to provide safe services as close as possible to where people live.</P>
        <P>In the past, Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe have operated independently, with two consultant general surgeons in each hospital. The difficulties faced by Roscommon and Portiuncula in maintaining surgical services independently, and the need for closer co-operation between them, were highlighted by the former Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al in March 2006. Advances in clinical care and ever-increasing levels of specialisation mean that the present model of care faces important practical difficulties, which must be addressed.</P>
        <P>In the light of these factors, the best way of retaining and developing services at Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals is for these hospitals to work closely together.  The Health Service Executive has advised that it is proceeding with the proposal for a Joint Department of Surgery and Anaesthesia at Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe.</P>
        <P>My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the detailed information sought provided directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Assisted living services are provided to people with disabilities in a number of ways, personal assistant services and home support services.</P>
        <P>The personal assistant service involves the employment of personal assistants (PAs) to enable people with physical or sensory disability to live as independent a life as possible. The PA provides assistance at the direction of the person with the disability and may involve providing assistance with tasks of everyday living such as personal care, household tasks and outside the home, whether in a work or social situation, thus promoting choice and independence for the person with the disability. The PA works on a one to one basis, in the home and/or in the community, with a person with a physical or sensory disability, with the aim of assisting that person to achieve independence.</P>
        <P>The Home Support service provides domestic and or personal care inputs at regular intervals on a weekly basis.  It differs from the role of a PA in that it focuses more on the necessary domestic and personal care inputs of those based mainly in the home but can occasionally include community activities. Home supports can be provided through a dedicated home support service or through the generic home help service.  Home supports can be an alternative to <Col N="890"/>residential care, where support to individuals in daily living can avoid the need for full time residential services.</P>
        <P>All assisted living services, including PA services and home support, is provided through voluntary agencies or through the HSE.</P>
        <P>The assisted living service aims to:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />facilitate appropriate and effective inclusion and participation in their local community; and</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />provide personal care when needed to facilitate community inclusion.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Services are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff.  Individuals&rsquo; needs are evaluated for the particular services and then decisions are made in relation to the allocation of resources.  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, priorities and the level of resources available.</P>
        <P>Under the Multi-Annual Investment Programme for people with a disability an additional 820,000 hours of PA/Home Support services has been put in place since 2005.</P>
        <P>This year alone an additional &euro;4.5m was allocated to provide 200,000 additional hours of PA/ Home support services.</P>
        <P>The total level of assisted living service provided this year amounts to 3.2 million hours with a total cost of approximately &euro;61m.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 125 together.</P>
        <P>The Specialist Palliative Care In-Patient Unit for Waterford is currently included in the Development Control Plan (D.C.P)  for Waterford Regional Hospital, which is nearing completion. It is anticipated that the appointed architects will commence design of the Hospital D.C.P in January 2009. The Design Team and HSE Estates Management will continue to liaise closely with relevant key stakeholders in Palliative Care in finalising this plan.</P>
        <P>Palliative Care Services in Wicklow are currently provided by a multidisciplinary team including General Practitioners, Public Health Nurses, Community Registered General Nurses, Health Care Assistants and Clinical Nurse Specialists in Palliative Care.  The planning and delivery of palliative care services are a matter for the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The HSE recently advertised for vacant posts for the Community Palliative Care Nursing Service in Wicklow and it is hoped to fill these posts towards the end of January next. The Public Health Nursing Service dealing with palliative care in Wicklow links closely with Blackrock Hospice to enable clients avail of respite care/hospice care and day care.  The future development of Palliative Care Services in Wicklow envisages a specialist hospice to be built in Wicklow to support patients in that area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE are currently developing a Five year Capital Plan for Specialist Palliative Care services which will include all proposed capital developments nationally. The timeframes and costings associated with each development, including Waterford, will be included and prioritised in the context of this Plan and in line with overall capital and non-capital resources available to the Executive.</P>
        <P>I wish to stress that both of the proposed developments hope to be considered by the HSE in the context of its overall priorities for Palliative Care and in line with agreed capital revenue resources.</P>

	<P>Implementation of the report of the National Taskforce on Obesity (NTFO) is ongoing.  By its nature, implementation of many of the recommendations was going to take place in the medium term with some of the actions more long-term.  A survey by the National Nutrition Surveillance Centre on the implementation of the NTFO Report shows that there has been action and progress on 60% of the recommendations. There is considerable evidence of action and delivery at local and community level.</P>
        <P>Since becoming Minister of State with responsibility for Health Promotion, I have made tackling obesity one of my key priorities.  In order to give a new impetus to this issue I am currently in the process of conducting a series of bilateral discussions with relevant Departments with regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the Taskforce.</P>
        <P>I am also in the process of establishing a multi-sectoral group representative of key Government Departments, Non-Governmental Organisations and other key experts to oversee implementation of the Task Force&rsquo;s recommendations.  Its first task will be to report before next Easter on the progress to date in the implementation of the report of the Task Force. I intend to Chair this Group and the first meeting will take place in January.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107, 210 and 211 together. </P>
        <P>My Office will shortly be publishing the Adoption Bill, 2008 which will ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. Under the new legislation, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries which have also ratified the Hague Convention, and countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement which meets Hague standards.</P>
        <P>While it is true to say that our current Agreement with Vietnam is based on Hague principles, as part of the preparations for our new legislation we need to ensure that our Agreement reflects the Hague Convention as comprehensively as possible. A new Agreement allows the opportunity to elaborate and strengthen some existing provisions to meet the standards which it is anticipated will be set in draft legislation. There have been considerable developments in intercountry adoption in Vietnam since the Agreement was signed 5 years ago. This progress also needs to be reflected in any new Agreement.</P>
        <P>There is a clause in the current Agreement which states that the Agreement will be automatically extended for another 5 year term unless one State notifies the other State to the contrary. Because of the proposed changes to our adoption legislation, the Agreement cannot &lsquo;roll over&rsquo; in its present form for another 5 years. As a result, the Irish Government was obliged to formally notify Vietnam that there can be no automatic renewal of the Agreement when the five year term expires on 1 May, 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am aware of the concerns of those parents who have already adopted and those who hope to adopt from Vietnam in the future. I would like to assure the Deputy that officials from my Office and the Adoption Board have been continuously monitoring the situation and liaising closely with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassy in Hanoi over recent months. In November, a senior official from my Office led a delegation to Vietnam accompanied by the Chairman and CEO of the Adoption Board. While the purpose of this visit was to commence discussions with the Vietnamese Authorities on the possibility of negotiating a new Agreement, the delegation also availed of the opportunity to meet with officials from various embassies and with UNICEF to discuss their views on intercountry adoption from Vietnam.</P><Col N="893"/>
        <P>The Irish Government has issued a formal request to the Vietnamese Authorities stating that we wish to enter into discussions immediately for the purpose of negotiating a new Agreement to follow on from the existing Agreement. We are currently awaiting the response of the Vietnamese authorities.</P>

In this regard, since 1997, the number of training places for physiotherapy has been increased from 64 to 145 which represents an increase of 127%.</P>
        <P>Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The numbers of physiotherapists employed has also grown significantly, with 593 whole time equivalents employed in December 1997 compared to 1,429 whole time equivalents employed in September 2008, which represents an increase of 141%.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to ensuring continued adequate recruitment of professional staff across a range of community settings to ensure the continued development of community services.  Additional funding of &euro;20 million has been provided in 2009 for health and education services for children with special educational needs.  This funding will provide a total of 125 additional therapy posts in the HSE targeted at children of school-going age. 90 of these will be in the disability services, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists, with an additional 35 posts being provided for child and adolescent mental health services.</P>
        <P>In addition, certain key health and social care professional posts, including physiotherapists, are to be protected by setting employment floors for these grades within the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2009.  These posts are essential to the development of a number of services areas such as disability, child and adolescent mental health services and child protection services.  In order to protect these posts, my Department will be writing to the HSE setting out the minimum employment levels to be maintained within each of these occupations in the health sector in 2009. The recruitment and retention of these key front line professional posts is vital to ensure continued progress in the development of community settings.</P>

	<P>I approved the HSE National Service Plan 2009 last Tuesday, 9 December 2008 under Section 31(8) of the Health Act, 2004.   In approving the Plan, I highlighted to the HSE certain critical performance issues in overseeing its implementation.   I also emphasised the necessity for the HSE to operate within the limits of its Voted allocation in delivering at a minimum, the levels of service which are provided for in the Plan.  </P>
        <P>In broad terms, the Plan outlines that the HSE will deliver the same activity in 2009 as in 2008.  In order to deliver the level of services it is committing to, the HSE will be reconfiguring many front line services.  This is in keeping with the overall strategic direction as set out in the HSE Corporate Plan 2008 &mdash; 2011 and includes conversion of in-patient work to day case work, a focus on reducing in-patient length of stay in acute hospitals, reduction of in-patient bed <Col N="896"/>numbers and associated costs and the provision of more services in community settings, thus reducing the dependency on in-patient beds.  The 2009 allocation includes &euro;120m to meet service pressures arising from demographic changes and also includes &euro;55m for the implementation of the Fair Deal Scheme, an additional &euro;15m for the Cancer Control Programme and &euro;10m for therapy supports for children of school going age.</P>
        <P>Clearly, the current fiscal position demands the most careful control of public expenditure and I am strongly of the view that account needs to be taken of all emerging potential cost pressures.  In this context, I have asked the HSE to review the latest information relevant to the management of Demand Led Schemes expenditure and to formulate and submit a contingency plan to address any pressures in this area over and above those provided for in the Plan.  During 2009, the HSE will provide me with detailed information relating to service activity levels by way of monthly Performance Monitoring Reports against the Plan.</P>
        <P>The Plan was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 10 December in line with Section 31(13) of the Health Act 2004 and the HSE has been asked to make arrangements to publish the Plan on their website as soon as possible in line with Section 31(14) of the Act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the &lsquo;Third Interim Report on the 2006 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; Expenditure on Health Services&rsquo;  which was recently published by the Public Accounts Committee.   A number of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations relating to matters such as the Hospital Consultants contract, the HSE&rsquo;s utilisation of assets and its financial management systems are already the subject of action by my Department, the HSE or other relevant bodies.</P>
        <P>With reference to the specific recommendations on effective deployment of resources and the need for performance indicators, I am committed to further developing the measurement of performance within the health system.  Significant progress has been made in the HSE Service Plan 2009 in terms of incorporating more explicit links between funding, staffing and services and the development of an improved set of activity measures, performance indicators and deliverables in key service areas, which are matched with timescales.  The HSE will report monthly to my Department on the performance of the health system against the agreed targets.  The improvements in the National Service Plan will form a framework for achieving greater clarity at an individual service unit level within the HSE on performance expectations regarding service delivery, staffing levels and funding.</P>
        <P>The first recommendation in the report refers to the need for the HSE to establish benchmarks to underpin decision making on the allocation of human resources.  The HSE has operational responsibility to determine the number and type of staff required to deliver particular services.  The financial constraints applying mean that there must be flexibility to deploy staff to areas of greatest service need.  The HSE has already initiated discussions with health service unions to facilitate this approach during 2009.</P>
        <P>The second recommendation refers to the need for decisions on resource allocation to be based primarily on activity levels, with incentives being put in place to improve performance. <Col N="898"/> Hospital funding is currently linked with performance through the National Casemix Programme which compares costs and activity between 37 hospitals that participate in the Casemix Budget Model, and reviews how over &euro;4.5 billion in acute hospital funding is allocated.  This Programme continues to be developed and rolled-out, both within hospitals already within the Programme, and to new hospitals.  Internationally, performance based funding models are less well developed outside of the hospital sector.  My Department and the HSE continue to keep opportunities in this area under review.</P>
        <P>The third recommendation refers to the use of data collected through Healthstat to inform allocation decisions and to the need for it to be made more readily available to key stakeholders.  Healthstat creates information at the level of hospital/hospital network and local Health Office.  This information is provided to hospitals and local Health Offices in advance of the monthly HealthStat forum meeting chaired by the CEO of the HSE and these meetings demand accountability from hospitals and local Health Offices for their individual performances.  The HSE intends to publish elements of HealthStat data on their website from March of next year.  In addition, work is progressing under the auspices of the Joint HSE/Department Performance Information Group to incorporate relevant information from HealthStat into the performance management framework for the Health Services at national level.</P>
        <P>The final recommendation relates to the need for  major health development projects to be planned on the basis of whole life cost.  Procedures currently in place require the HSE to identify the life cycle costs, including revenue and staffing costs, of proposed capital projects prior to their submission as part of the Executive&rsquo;s proposed Capital Plan.  These costs are a key criterion against which such proposals are evaluated.  In conclusion, I welcome the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Progress is already being achieved on many of the recommendations and work will continue in both my Department and the HSE in relation to the Report&rsquo;s findings.</P>

	<P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board (Amendment) Act, 2008 imposed an obligation on the VHI to acquire a reserve fund sufficient to allow it to submit an application for authorisation to the Financial Regulator by 31 December 2008. Any decision on whether to grant authorisation or not is entirely a matter for the Regulator. The VHI submitted an application in June. However, before any decision on the application had been taken by the Regulator the Supreme Court found the 2003 Risk Equalisation Scheme to be <i>ultra vires</i> on 16 July. One consequence of the Court&rsquo;s decision was that VHI would not receive the transfers due to be paid to it under the scheme. This development had an adverse impact of the financial projections submitted to the Regulator in June as part of the application. The Regulator has asked the VHI to submit revised projections. These will reflect the anticipated impact of the measures announced by the Government on 19 November. The company is exploring all the options open to it under the 2008 Act that would help satisfy the Regulator&rsquo;s solvency requirements.             </P>

	<P>I am considering the legal, financial and service implications of the judgment of Justice Finlay-Geoghegan in the Hickey Pharmacy case. The judgment confirms that, under the terms of the Community Pharmacy Contract or Agreement, I have the power to alter the payments to pharmacists after consultation with the Irish Pharmacy Union. I intend, very shortly, to begin a consultation process, in order to achieve significant savings in the pharmaceutical distribution chain. </P>

	<P>The introduction of the working arrangements agreed under the new consultants&rsquo; contract will result in the increased availability of senior clinical decision makers to treat and discharge patients as part of the transition to a consultant-delivered service from the present consultant-led service.  The successful implementation of the new contract will improve the position of public patients in terms of their access to the public health system. </P>
        <P>Under the contract consultants will work a 37 hour week in an extended span of the working day from 8 am to 8 pm, where appropriate, Monday to Friday; and a scheduled attendance of up to five hours where required on Saturday, Sunday and Public Holidays. Other benefits of the new contract include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />New private practice provisions range from a total prohibition on such practice to an upper limit of 20% for newly appointed consultants (30% for existing consultants).</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Consultant, while clinically independent, is subject to statutory and regulatory requirements and corporate policies and procedures.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Under the contract the ratio of public to private practice will be implemented through the Clinical Directorate structure and the implementation of this ratio will be the subject of audit, including audit by my Department.</P>
        <P>Clinical Directors will provide clinical leadership in the context of implementation and they will have a pivotal role in monitoring compliance by individual consultants with the ratio of public to private practice stipulated in their contracts, taking corrective action if the private practice limit is being exceeded.</P>
        <P>The new contract also provides for the introduction of Clinical Directorate Service Plans.

	<P>The Health Service Executive has developed a number of systems for measuring performance within the hospital system, including those related to the presentation and treatment of patients at Emergency Departments. However, it is accepted that the current systems in a number of hospitals cannot capture the full waiting time experience of all patients attending Emergency Departments. </P>
        <P>I believe that setting clear targets for improvement and measuring performance against these targets helps to drive further improvements in services.  I have asked the HSE to set a revised maximum waiting time target of no more than 6 hours from registration to admission or discharge in 2009 for all patients attending Emergency Departments, and to introduce a measurement system in 2009 to record the total waiting time for all such patients. The HSE has committed to introducing these measures in its National Service Plan, 2009.</P>

	<P>My Office is continuing to work to create the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative frameworks which will ensure a well regulated regime of adoption which reflects both the changing nature of adoption and the growth in intercountry adoption. The Government&rsquo;s aim is to support and protect prospective parents, and even more importantly, the children for whom adoption services are devised and provided. </P>
        <P>The first priority is the ratification of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Intercountry Adoption, 1993. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Adoption Bill, 2008, which will ratify the Convention, will be published at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>A core principle of the Hague Convention is that intercountry adoption should be child centred, that is, in all stages of the process the child&rsquo;s interests must be paramount. The Hague Convention has put in place the equivalent of a contract between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction. It is an additional safeguard for a receiving country like Ireland regarding the standards that are being applied in the sending country, over which we have no jurisdiction. As a receiving country it is especially important to have some confidence in the process of consent to the adoption, the status of the child as adoptable and a guarantee of no improper financial gain from the process. Legislation and specifically the regime of the Hague Convention is at least some assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was affected in the best interests of the child.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006 -2010 (NCIP), which will invest &euro;575 million over 5 years, with &euro;358 million of this in capital grant aid for childcare services. </P>
        <P>I am aware that concerns regarding the new Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) have been expressed by some community childcare services and I have met with representatives of a number of service providers and discussed issues of concern to them.  It is considered that the new scheme provides an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The CCSS was informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme.  These include the fact that the subvention to services is more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage, and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is removed.  Account is also taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which were in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, are now available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.  In addition, transitional  funding arrangements have been made to ensure that existing grant recipients are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.</P>
        <P>As you may be aware the framework for the CCSS was originally announced in July 2007 and on the basis of information collected from the community childcare services, adjustments were made to the scheme by the Government in December of that year. These adjustments addressed many of the concerns expressed by childcare providers in relation to the CCSS.  I am confident that the scheme is a fair and equitable way of supporting community childcare operators in the provision of an affordable and high quality service to parents, based on their means.</P>

	<P>Regulations coming within the remit of my Department and Bodies under its aegis have been examined in the context of the Government programme to measure and reduce administrative burdens which is being co-ordinated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has identified a number of Regulations which impose burdens on business and in line with the overall effort to measure and reduce administrative burdens across Government, is devoting resources to the Government programme to measure and reduce administrative burdens.</P>
        <P>The CSO has identified the most burdensome information obligations and plans are well advanced to move to the next phase of the project involving a detailed measurement of those information obligations representing 90% of the total burden.  When the measurement has been completed (first half of 2009), a simplification plan will be prepared detailing how the burden on business can be minimised, thereby contributing to the Government&rsquo;s overall target of reducing administrative burdens on business by 25% by 2012.</P>
        <P>In addition, in its Statement of Strategy 2008-2010, the CSO has identified as a corporate priority the minimising of response burden on CSO inquiry respondents.  To achieve this the CSO is taking a number of additional actions, including increasing the use of electronic reporting methods, adopting better sampling techniques, increasing coordination between surveys and making greater use of administrative records.  As a first step towards minimising response burden, it was necessary to measure the existing burden.  CSO issued a report in June 2008 presenting an analysis of the burden imposed on Irish business by making CSO statistical returns for surveys issued in 2005, 2006 and 2007.</P>
        <P>As the minimisation of response burden is a corporate priority, contributions have been made by a range of officials and it is not, therefore, possible to give the precise staff input into the above projects but it would equate approximately to the direct input of two staff members at professional statistician level.  CSO anticipates that this level of input will be maintained in 2009 and expanded as resources permit with a view, in particular, to replacing surveys of smaller enterprises with administrative data.</P>

        <P>My Department has not been responsible for the production of any new Bills or the negotiation of any new EU Directives in the period since June 2008 and consequently has not produced any RIAs in relation to same in the given period.</P>
        <P>Since June 2008, two Statutory Instruments relating to the work of the Central Statistics Office (CSO) have been produced.  These Statutory Instruments specify technical requirements such as the contents and scope of statistical surveys and do not alter the regulatory framework.  As RIA is only required in the case of significant SIs involving changes to the regulatory environment, it was not applicable in these cases.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 153 together.</P>
        <P>The acquisition of land and buildings by an enterprise in an eligible region can be supported under the Regional Aid (Industry and Services) Scheme 2007-13 for Ireland and under the Industrial Development legislation. Under Industrial Development legislation Enterprise Ireland is authorised to provide support for the acquisition of buildings and building modifications, however, I understand that the agency does not choose to exercise this authority.</P>
        <P>I have been informed that Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing policy is not to support the acquisition costs of land or buildings. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus is on investing the taxpayer&rsquo;s money in the productive assets of the company &mdash; the equipment and people &mdash; to support the creation of innovation and competitive companies which we believe represents the better value to the tax payer. In order to develop Irish Industry, capability investments in companies (in areas such as Research and Development, Innovation, and Management Development) rather <Col N="915"/>than investments in the acquisition of land and buildings, represent the best return for the Irish taxpayer. Buildings and capital equipment investments can be supported at the Enterprise Ireland Investment Committee but the rates are not very attractive for companies. Due to Regional Aid restrictions the rates are 15% for a small company, 7.5% for a medium company and 0% for a large company in the Dublin/Mid East region. In the Border-Midlands-West region, the rates are higher &mdash; 50% for a small company, 40% for a medium company and 30% for a large company. These rates are to be further reduced or eliminated from 2013 onwards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In certain circumstances, Enterprise Ireland can provide support towards buildings and building modifications, such as under the Research and Development Fund (provided for in the EU Research Development and Innovation State Aid Guidelines) and for capital investments considered at Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Investment Committee (under the EU Regional Aid Guidelines). Additionally, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Community Enterprise Centre Scheme 2007-2009 aims to enhance the development of an enterprise climate through the provision of infrastructural facilities to support the establishment and expansion of micro enterprises through local community participation. The current scheme, announced in 2007, has a total fund of &euro;21m with three calls for proposals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the main legislative provisions and rules covering the use of closed circuit television cameras (CCTV) in the workplace are a matter for the Data Protection Commissioner.  The use of CCTV in a business place or workplace is not prohibited but it is controlled by the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. This legislation falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to legislative provisions for close circuit television in the workplace is limited to safety in the workplace. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 requires every employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of all of his or her employees.  Employers and those who control work places to any extent must identify the hazards in the workplaces under their control and assess the risks presented by these hazards.  Employers are required to implement any improvements considered necessary by the risk assessment. There are situations where the installation of CCTV systems may be considered necessary as a result of a risk assessment.</P>
        <P>CCTV systems have been in use for many years as driving aids for operators of very large mechanically propelled equipment in the underground mining and surface quarrying industries. These were initially introduced in these sectors based on risk assessment of reversing manoeuvres and have enormous advantages both in terms of pedestrian safety and operator efficiency in the use of such large equipment. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Quarries) Regulations 2008 through the provisions of Regulation 23(2)(<i>e</i>) and Schedule 2 of the regulations set down the conditions under which CCTV may be required in relation to equipment used in the surface quarrying industry.</P>
        <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 504 of 2006) through the provisions of Regulation 87 and Schedule 6 of the regulations set down the conditions under which CCTV may be required in relation to equipment used in the construction industry. The measure is included as one of a number controls to address the need for improved all round visibility for earth moving and materials handling machinery in construction. Construction plant and machinery due to their application can have limited driver visibility particularly to the rear, a fact that has contributed to several serious accidents in the industry.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 156 together.</P>
        <P>The role of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), which was established on an interim basis in February, 2007, is to foster and enforce a national culture of employment rights compliance in the State. In order to fulfil this role, NERA undertakes a range of functions, including the provision of impartial information to employers and employees, an inspection function and a prosecution and enforcement service. In the period between 2000 and NERA&rsquo;s establishment, the Employment Rights Information Unit and the Labour Inspectorate would have fulfilled a similar role. NERA Information services provide impartial information on a wide variety of employment rights legislation, including Employment Regulation Orders (EROs), to employers and employees by telephone, in writing, by e-mail and through on-going public awareness campaigns. Some 120,000 enquiries have been dealt with to end November in 2008 while some 93,000 enquiries were handled in 2007. Approximately 30% of the total calls received are initiated by employers. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of enquiries by sector.  Further details on NERA activities are set out in the following table.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2008, NERA launched a nationwide public awareness campaign to raise awareness of employment rights and the services provided by NERA. The widely disseminated advertising and promotion campaign ran from 14 January 2008 to the first week in May 2008 and sought to engage employers and employees and the general public to promote a culture of employment rights compliance. The NERA website, www.employmentrights.ie, was launched on 10 January, 2008. Over one and three quarter million pages have been viewed since its launch to date.  Average daily page hits in the year to end November 2008 numbered in excess of 5,000. The NERA website contains information specifically relating to EROs pertaining to the Hotel and Catering sectors. In response to the growing numbers of employers using its service, NERA launched two new publications a &lsquo;Guide to Employment Rights&rsquo; and a &lsquo;Guide to Inspections&rsquo;. The &lsquo;Guide to Employment Rights&rsquo; is intended to give general guidance to employers and employees on employment rights matters and it includes specific information in relation to Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) in the Catering and Hotels sector.</P>
        <P>NERA also engage in exhibitions and deliver presentations to key stakeholders. Of the 129 presentations and exhibitions in which NERA participated during 2007 and 2008, fifty-nine involved employer groups. In 2008, these included presentations to the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Annual Conference, the F&aacute;ilte Ireland HR Hotel Managers Network and the Small Firms Association annual conference.  NERA also delivered presentations to The Human Resource Managers Conference and the Club Managers Association of Europe (Ireland) CMAE. In October 2008 NERA delivered a stakeholders briefing to the IBEC Hospitality Sector, which was attended by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Irish Hotels Federation.</P><Col N="918"/>
        <P Just="Left">NERA undertakes inspections to determine employment rights compliance.  In the course of those inspections, the inspectors provide information to employers on their obligations under employment rights legislation, including obligations under Employment Regulation Orders, if applicable. The number of inspections undertaken in 2007 and 2008 to check compliance with the Catering and Hotels employment legislation is set out in the following table. While the work of the Labour Court is a day to day matter for that body, I have been advised by the Court that it publishes notices in two National daily newspapers and Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on the making of each new Catering and Hotels ERO. In the years from 2000 to 2008, the Labour Court made 12 EROs in respect of the Catering sector and 7 EROS in respect of the Hotel sector.</P>
        <P>In addition, I have been advised by the Court that copies of each Order were sent to all employers known to the Court to whom the Orders apply. Their circulation list for Catering EROs amounts to a total of 2,119 employers, individuals, organisations and firms and for the Hotels EROs amounts to a total of 847 employers, individuals, organisations and firms. I should also point out that there is a statutory obligation on employers to post notices to inform their employees of the details of these EROs. Awareness raising activities by NERA and the Labour Court in relation to Catering and Hotels EROs are conducted as part of the overall activities of both bodies, the costs of which are met from within their respective operating budgets. It is not possible to disaggregate the staffing or financial resources allocated to the specific information provision activities referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.</P>

The tight negotiating timeframe did not lend itself to a formal RIA process so no RIA was undertaken.<br />However the Irish position on issues that might be included in the eventual package of UCITS IV proposals had been developed in 2007 during a stakeholder consultation process. This was conducted to determine a formal Irish response to an extended EU wide consultation process, involving Green and White Papers, that led to the eventual publication of the EU proposals. These issues were outlined in detail in an Oireachtas Scrutiny Note submitted to the D&aacute;il in September 2008.</entry>

	<P>Two Industrial Development agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, together with Meath County Enterprise Board (CEB) are responsible for enterprise development in the area in question. The primary role of IDA Ireland is the attraction of high quality Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Ireland. An integral and fundamental element of this role is the agency&rsquo;s mandate to promote sustainable and balanced regional development. However, the marketing of individual areas for FDI and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency. While I may give general policy directives to the agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>However, I understand that the town of Navan in particular, continues to be actively marketed by IDA Ireland to potential investors. The town is well equipped to compete with other areas for FDI due to its excellent business park. Enterprise Ireland offers a full range of financial and non-financial supports to indigenous companies. In the three years 2005, 2006 and 2007, over &euro;6.5m of funding was approved for client companies in Meath. The County also has thriving Community Enterprise Centres that have been financially assisted by the agency. These Centres foster the development of micro-enterprises, which in turn can grow into larger enterprises. Funding of over &euro;635,000 has been approved for three locations in the County &mdash; Navan, Trim and Kells.  Particular emphasis is placed on creating and developing employment opportunities and enterprise space for the unemployed.</P>
        <P>The role of the Meath CEB is to provide support for small businesses with ten employees or fewer in both start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. The CEB delivers a series of programmes to underpin this role and can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to project promoters based in County Meath. From inception in 1993 to end 2007, the latest year for which figures are available, the Meath CEB has approved almost &euro;6 million in grant aid to some 530 projects and assisted in the creation of 1,064 net jobs in the County.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards Tourism, I understand from the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism that in accordance with the provisions of section 8(1)(<i>a</i>) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act, 2003, it is a day to day matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland to encourage, promote and support either inside or outside the State, the development of Tourism traffic within and to the State. In addition, in accordance with the provisions of section 8(1)(<i>b</i>) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act, 2003, it is a day to day matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland to encourage, promote and support the recruitment, training, education and development of persons for the purposes of employment in connection with the tourism industry in the State. Insofar as my area is concerned, I am satisfied that the policies and initiatives being pursued by the Industrial Development agencies and the CEB will continue to bring about employment opportunities for the area.</P>

	<P>Payment of statutory redundancy is, in the first instance, a matter for the employer. In relation to the person mentioned by the Deputy, my Department has no record of an application having been made for a rebate in respect of a statutory redundancy payment paid to that person by the employer mentioned. Further, no application has been made either by the individual or the employer for a lump-sum payment from the Social Insurance Fund on the basis of inability to pay or otherwise.</P>
        <P>I have no role in relation to direct intervention in the matter of statutory redundancy payments. The choice of mortgage product ultimately rests with the consumer in light of the terms and conditions that their lending institution offers. The decision of borrowers is influenced by factors such as their personal preferences and their own assessment of the relative merits of fixed and variable rate mortgages taking into account the information made available by the Financial Regulator. The Financial Regulator, which has a statutory consumer protection mandate, provides advice to consumers on the advantages and disadvantages of fixed rate mortgages.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the cost of a fixed rate mortgage reflects longer-term funding costs for the financial institution which provides it. Therefore, in contrast to tracker and variable rates, the cost neither rises with an increase in the ECB base rate nor falls with a reduction in it. The Financial Regulator has highlighted, in the context of its consumer information role, that for those whose finances may be stretched, such as first-time buyers, fixed rates offer peace of mind. While they may cost more over the longer term they allow the mortgage holder to budget confidently. However, the Financial Regulator also stresses that fixed rate mortgages give less flexibility than variable rates. My Department will monitor the issue raised by the Deputy, in consultation with the Financial Regulator, in relation to credit institutions participating in the Guarantee Scheme, in light of the objectives of the Scheme.</P>

	<P>The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntarist in nature. The law on industrial relations disputes does not generally seek to impose a solution on the parties to a dispute but rather seeks to assist them in arriving at a solution. To this end, the State has established a number of institutions, including the Labour Court, to assist in the resolution of trade disputes between employers and workers. In the case referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the Labour Court conducted a hearing on a trade dispute and issued a recommendation setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it should be settled. Under Industrial Relations legislation, the Labour Court cannot compel a company to comply with its recommendation. As it is a Court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the Court&rsquo;s recommendations. Recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding and, ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.</P>

	<P>The role of a carer, and how that role may diminish or cease over time, is recognised.  F&Aacute;S provides support to clients to access bereavement and loss training/supports if this need is identified to assist the person return to work or training. People who have been in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance can avail of all F&Aacute;S training and employment programmes when their eligibility for carer&rsquo;s allowance ceases. For those who wish to work in the care sector, there are a number of programmes currently available, i.e., a range of Child care programmes, Personal Assistant (Assisted Living) and Care for the Elderly. Personal Development and Return to Work courses can also benefit those making decisions about re-entering the workforce. For carer&rsquo;s who have completed their caring duties and wish to access F&Aacute;S training, a training bonus of &euro;31.80 will be paid to those who have been in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance for more than 12 months prior to participating on a F&Aacute;S training course. This will be in addition to the regular training allowance of &euro;197 (full-time) or &euro;113 (part-time) per week.</P>

	<P>Extensive research relating to the employment of people with disabilities has been conducted by my Department, and F&Aacute;S, with a view to gathering information as part of the Department&rsquo;s commitments under the Disability Act, 2005. A review of the operation of the Wage Subsidy Scheme and a study on acquired disability and employment have been carried out on behalf of my Department. A survey of private sector employers&rsquo; attitudes to recruiting people with disabilities, and their level of awareness of F&Aacute;S grants for the adaptation, recruitment, and <Col N="924"/>retention of people with disabilities has been carried out on behalf of F&Aacute;S. A review of the effectiveness of the Supported Employment Programme in the context of current operating standards has also been carried out on behalf of F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>A study of the efficiency and effectiveness of vocational training and rehabilitative training services for people with disabilities provided by Specialist Training Providers has been carried out on behalf of my Department and F&Aacute;S, and the Department of Health and Children. In the context of the implementation by my Department of a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities the actioning of the findings and recommendations contained in these reports is expected to improve future training and employment opportunities for people with disabilities. A draft outline of the implementation of a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities has been developed by my Department, and has recently been discussed with the Consultative Forum on an Employment Strategy for people with disabilities that has been established under the Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan. A key focus of the strategy is on effecting the optimal changes to existing programmes, schemes and services, in particular with regard to the Supported Employment Programme and the Wage Subsidy Scheme.</P>
        <P>The overall objective of the implementation of such a comprehensive employment strategy is to enhance the operation and effectiveness of the range of F&Aacute;S supports and services for facilitating increased participation of people with disabilities in the labour market in the context of the employment target set by the Sectoral Plan. The Plan provides for an increase by 7,000 in the employment of people with disabilities capable of holding a job by 2010. The Sectoral Plan will be reviewed in 2009. A proposal to implement an access and learning support service in F&Aacute;S mainline training centres has been developed, and the appointment of an access officer to coordinate these services is under active consideration by F&Aacute;S.</P>

The development of such a joint bridging programme has been the subject of detailed discussions between F&Aacute;S and the HSE, and of necessary follow-on discussions with providers within F&Aacute;S. Arrangements are now at an advanced stage by F&Aacute;S Community Services to roll out a pilot bridging programme in 2009. F&Aacute;S Community Services have also developed a separate joint bridging initiative with St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation in Charleville, County Cork. The aim of this project, which has recently commenced, is to test and develop a suitable training programme specification to assist in the transition from rehabilitative training to vocational training with a view to entering the open labour market.</P>

	<P>In an economy the size of Ireland&rsquo;s it is not unusual that one of the larger financial or legal advisers has to deal with potential conflicts of interest arising from their representation of more than one client in the same sector. I have been assured by my external advisors on the banks guarantee scheme, that where potential conflicts arise they are dealt with through the application of well established &ldquo;Chinese Wall&rdquo; structures which are overseen by their compliance departments. These &ldquo;Chinese Walls&rdquo; operate as information barriers which ensure that any advice given to the Government is confidential and is provided by a team which is segregated from and independent of their work for other clients.</P>

	<P>I am fully satisfied that the appointment of advisors to advise me on the bank guarantee scheme was in accordance with public procurement procedures. Those procedures provide for negotiation with a single contractor without a competitive process where the timeframe for a competitive process cannot be met due to the extreme urgency of the circumstances. The Deputy will recall that speed of action was essential to the Government&rsquo;s response to the credit crisis and to the introduction of the bank guarantee. Considering the extent of the potential liability of the State it was essential that the best advice was available to the Government as a matter of urgency. Clearly, the engagement of advisors on the bank guarantee scheme comes within the exceptional circumstances anticipated in the public procurement procedures.</P>

        <P Just="Left">As a result of a Government decision on 21 June 2005, Regulatory Impact Analysis must be conducted on all proposals for primary legislation involving changes to the regulatory framework (subject to some exceptions), significant Statutory Instruments and proposals for EU Directives and significant EU Regulations when they are published by the European Commission. In the period 1 June to date in 2008 no Screening Regulatory Impact Analysis or Regulatory Impact Analysis were undertaken. In relation to the Statutory Instruments, Bills and EU Directives as listed below, the reasons Regulatory Impact Analysis were not carried out range from the Statutory Instruments &ldquo;not being categorised as &lsquo;significant&rsquo;, to being technical in nature or giving effect to legal provisions&rdquo; already contained within the primary legislation. Regulatory Impact Analysis does not apply to Statutory Instruments made under the European Communities Act 1972, Financial Transfers Act 1992 and the Criminal Justice Terrorist Offences Act 2005 where those Statutory Instruments give effect to EU sanctions against persons and entities designated by EC Regulations as being associated with terrorist organisations or repressive regimes.</P>

        <QRef>[46108/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that no report has been carried out on the compliance cost of the C2 certification system. Prior to the introduction of Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT), there were significant difficulties with tax compliance in the construction sector. RCT was introduced in 1970 as a measure to tackle that non-compliance problem, and has been significantly enhanced since then, including the inclusion of the meat processing and forestry sectors in 1998. The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that RCT continues to be a vital instrument in striving to protect tax compliance in the construction sector, and also in the forestry and meat-processing sectors.</P>
        <P>The reasons why these special compliance provisions are necessary in these sectors include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The mobility of business within the sectors which makes it difficult for Revenue to ensure tax compliance.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The fact that cash payments are common in the sectors and can be disguised as payments for other supplies, such as, materials or equipment, or payments to fictitious, or non-involved persons.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The significant costs of labour as a percentage of turnover.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The difficulties in tackling non-compliance in the construction sector are recognised internationally and different jurisdictions have come up with their own responses to the problem. The Revenue Commissioners consider the RCT system is an appropriate and essential response for the protection of tax revenues. RCT provides an audit trail linking main and sub-contractors.  It provides for certification of compliant sub-contractors and ongoing monitoring to prevent abuses. It also provides for a mandatory withholding tax operated by the main contractor in relation to sub-contractors who do not hold certificates or where payment is not authorised. This arrangement tilts the balance of behaviour towards tax compliance.</P><Col N="930"/>
        <P>In the context of concerns expressed by the social partners, Revenue gave a commitment under Towards 2016 &mdash; The Ten-Year Social Partnership Framework Agreement &mdash; to strengthen the RCT system as a means to ensuring compliance in the sector. This is being done in consultation with the Social Partners and, where appropriate, in liaison with the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs, the National Employments Rights Authority and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment. The construction industry continues to be an area of concern for Revenue, and 25% of its audit and compliance resources were assigned to this sector in 2006 &amp; 2007. Resources are currently assigned based on the identified risks in individual Districts and Regions.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is not possible for legislation to prescribe a full list of injuries, infirmities or disabilities which would render an individual incapacitated from maintaining himself or herself.</P>
        <P>In the case to which the details supplied refers, I understand that the individual is under 65 years of age and is not otherwise liable to income tax and the question to be addressed is <Col N="931"/>whether he is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself. I have been further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that this case has been re-examined by a senior officer who has also taken the view that the individual in respect of whom the particulars delivered refers is not permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself/herself. This being the case, the individual is not, until he reaches 65 years of age, entitled to a repayment of DIRT.

	<P>Section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 governs the scheme for tax relief on donations to eligible charities and other approved bodies.  The administration of this scheme is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners. </P>
        <P>All primary and post primary schools providing education based on a programme prescribed or approved by the Minister for Education and Science automatically qualify as approved bodies for the purposes of section 848A.</P>
        <P>Tax relief is granted at the standard 20% rate or at the higher 41% rate, depending on the rate of tax payable by the donor for the relevant year of assessment.  The precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations varies depending on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, <Col N="932"/>a person who is subject to self-assessment or a company.  In the case of donors who are PAYE taxpayers, the relief is given on a &ldquo;grossed up&rdquo; basis to the eligible body (rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor).  The claim for refund is made to Revenue by the eligible body.  In the case of a self-assessed donor, that individual claims the relief in his/her income tax return and there is no grossing up arrangement.  In the case of a company, it will claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192, 215, 224 and 243 together.</P>
        <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) first became aware of the possible contamination of Irish pig meat with PCB on 28 November 2008 when advised of the results of an analysis conducted by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  This result was confirmed on 1 December.</P>
        <P>The FSAI&rsquo;s first contact with the Dutch authorities was on Thursday 4 December, when an official of the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority  informed the FSAI that it was of the opinion that there was a connection between the discovery of PCBs in Irish pig meat and dioxins found in pig meat in the Netherlands.  Subsequently the FSAI had several discussions with staff from the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority concerning their test results.</P>
        <P>The Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Children was first informed of the contamination on the morning of Saturday 6 December.</P>
        <P>The decision to recall products was taken on Saturday 6 December, on the basis of the information from test results on pigs from Ireland indicating the presence of high levels of PCBs and dioxin.  Based on these results, the applicable legal limits and food intake data from the FSAI&rsquo;s total diet study, the FSAI was able to draw conclusions on the potential danger to the Irish population.  A more formal assessment was later made by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) which endorsed the decision to recall pork and pork products.</P>
        <P>A total recall was recommended in order to minimise the exposure of consumers to dioxin, and because of initial difficulties in identifying the pork derived from animals which had been exposed to the contaminated feed.</P>
        <P>On 5 December 2008, the FSAI informed the European Commission through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) that an investigation was being conducted by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in close collaboration with the FSAI into the source of a contaminant in animal feed.</P>
        <P>On 6 December 2008, FSAI notified the European Commission that Ireland was taking steps to remove from sale all pork and bacon products.  Following further discussions between the FSAI and European Commission, on 8 December the European Commission requested EFSA to provide a scientific assistance risk on the risk for human health of the possibility of the presence of dioxins in pig meat and pig meat products from Ireland.</P>

Furthermore, following the European Council of Ministers&rsquo; decision in March 2008 to bring Benzylpiperazine (BZP) under control, my Department will be introducing regulations to give effect to this decision within the March 2009 time-frame set by the Council. </P>

	<P>With regard to Community Rating: although the Supreme Court found the particular Risk Equalisation Scheme to be <i>ultra vires</i>, it did not strike down the principle of applying risk equalisation or any of the other important elements of the regulatory framework that supports private health insurance in Ireland.  A primary objective of Government policy in health insurance is that it should be affordable for the broadest possible cross section of the community including older people and those who suffer ill-health.  This policy objective has been implemented through a substantial body of primary and secondary legislation providing for open enrolment, community rating and lifetime cover. </P>
        <P>With regard to VHI price increases: successive Voluntary Health Insurance Board Acts have given the company the freedom to design its products and set its prices.  As Minister, I have no role in these matters.</P>

	<P>The National Physical and Sensory Disability Database (NPSDD) was established in 2002.  Information for the database is collected by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and non-statutory service providers.  The database is managed nationally by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health and Children.  Information for the NPSDD is collected by means of interviews with individuals who meet the registration criteria.  The primary focus of the NPSDD is to facilitate service planning and service provision, it also aims to record the details of people availing of, or requiring, a specialised health and personal service.  Participation in the NPSDD is voluntary.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE), through the Schemes Modernisation Programme, has greatly improved the operational efficiency and customer friendliness of its medical card and GP visit card processes in recent years. Progress includes:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A national training programme and the publication of guidelines for staff involved in assessments.  Such training and guidelines ensure that the schemes are administered in a standardised way nationally.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The publication of an information booklet for the public on the various schemes available, including the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of the HSE call save &ldquo;infoline&rdquo;, which provides information to the public on health and social services.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Executive is targeting a standard national response time of 3-6 weeks for the completion of decisions and replies to medical card applications.  This target will only apply in cases where all the required information is supplied by the applicant (approximately 90% of cases).  However, more complex cases may require a longer turnaround time.  I fully support the Executive in its ongoing endeavours to shorten the turnaround time for medical card applications.  As the particular issue raised regarding the renewal of medical cards in Finglas, Dublin 11 is a <Col N="947"/>service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>In January 2008, the Government announced the establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health to support the Minister for Equality, Disability and Mental Health in exercising responsibilities across four Government Departments: Health &amp; Children, Education &amp; Science, Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment and Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform.  The new Office brings together responsibility for a range of different policy areas and State services which directly impact on the lives of people with a disability and people with mental health issues. The Government&rsquo;s decision to establish the Office for Disability and Mental Health reflects its commitment to developing a more coherent and integrated response to the needs of people with disabilities and mental health issues. The designation of a Minister of State with responsibility for Equality, Disability and Mental Health and the establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health will facilitate cross-agency and cross-departmental working and enable us to deliver real benefits to clients and service users into the future.</P>
        <P>Under the aegis of this Office, a Cross Sectoral team of officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science, the Health Service Executive and the National Council for Special Education was established and meets on a regular basis to address issues arising in relation to the implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 (EPSEN).  It had been intended to have the EPSEN Act fully implemented by 2010, and to commence Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 for 5 to 18 year-olds in tandem.  In the light of the current financial circumstances, it is unfortunately necessary to defer the implementation of the above legislation.</P>
        <P>However, this does not in any way dilute the Government&rsquo;s commitment in the areas of disability and mental health. The Government has not only protected the increased funding base for disability and mental health services that has been built up over recent years, but has in this Budget provided an additional &euro;20 million for health and education services for children with special educational needs. &euro;10 million of this allocation will be to the HSE, and &euro;10 million to the Department of Education and Science, to enable the services provided to children with special educational needs to be enhanced and strengthened, as a first step towards the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, and of Part 2 of the Disability Act for 5 to 18 year olds, and subsequently to adults, at a later date.</P>
        <P>With regard to the specific commitments in the Sectoral Plan relating to housing, income support measures and vocational training and employment issues, the position is that:</P><Col N="950"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A protocol to govern inter-agency cooperation between the HSE and Housing Authorities in relation to services provided for people with a disability has been agreed. The protocol is focused on children under five years who are assessed by the HSE under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, and are identified as likely to require housing support. The protocol was developed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Health and Children in association with the HSE and the local authorities and is in line with commitments given in the sectoral plans of both Departments following the requirements of section 32 and section 36 of the Disability Act 2005. It details the process to be undertaken between the HSE and local authorities. Further protocols in relation to assessment of need for people with a disability will be developed and implemented in line with the phased implementation of the statutory requirements of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 to all age groups. The details of this protocol are available on the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government website at: <i>http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/ SpecialNeeds/DisabledPersons/</i>.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Government has decided to transfer income support and maintenance schemes to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. An inter departmental implementation group, representative of the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, has responsibility to drive the transfer of allowances in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />There are 22,400 children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance. The transfer of Domiciliary Care Allowance to the Department of Social and Family Affairs is a priority for 2009. The legislation is in place and detailed arrangements for the transfer and administration of the Domiciliary Care Allowance by the Department of Social and Family Affairs are being developed.</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Office for Disability and Mental Health is working with the HSE and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (D/ETE) with a view to promoting a cross-sectoral approach to supporting and enhancing adult day occupational and training services for people with disabilities. Progress on this issue is linked to the HSE National Review on Adult Day Services for People with Disabilities.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to section 12 of the Disability Act 2005 which provides that liaison officers may furnish a copy of an assessment, report, or any other information which the liaison officer considers appropriate to a public body for the purpose of assisting an applicant in applying for personal or individual services provided by the body relevant to his or her needs.</P>

In the case of national roads, funding for maintenance, which includes the gritting of roads and other safety related work in winter, is provided by my Department to the NRA which allocates it among the local authorities.

	<P>Staff in the central co-ordination unit of my Department have been assigned to manage the process to give effect to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reduce by 25% administrative burdens. As part of this process all Divisions in my Department have been asked to identify information obligations in the legislation that they are responsible for and to prioritise them having regard to their impact on business so that those with the greatest burden on business can be identified and the burden measured and proposals developed to achieve a reduction in the administrative burden. As this work is being carried out in addition to other duties it is not possible to quantify the additional costs arising.</P>

	<P>The cost of an underground metro system depends on a wide range of variables, including ground conditions, size and spacing of stations, tunnel configuration and the amount of land acquisition.  There is also a wide range of variables impacting on the cost of on-street light rail systems, including whether it is on-street or off- street, the scale of utilities diversion and so on. A comparison of the type suggested by the Deputy is, therefore, of little practical value. The most fundamental issue, of course, is the level of passenger capacity required on a particular corridor. However, a report for the World Bank in 2000 did try to generalize this issue and pointed out that underground railways are 4 to 6 times the cost of surface railways.</P>
        <P>In relation to the part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question on land ownership in the vicinity of the proposed stations on Metro North, the owners and occupiers of all lands affected are publicly available in the book of reference submitted by the RPA to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in September last as part of the Railway Order Application for Metro North.  It is not clear from the question to which land in the vicinity of Dublin Port the Deputy is referring, particularly as the alignment of Metro North is some distance from the port area.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Under the Roads Act, 1993, the maintenance of roads, including winter maintenance, is a statutory function of each individual road authority. This work is funded out of each authority&rsquo;s own resources, supplemented in the case of regional and local roads by discretionary and block grants allocated annually by my Department.  In the case of national roads, funding for maintenance, which includes the gritting of roads and other safety related work in winter, is provided by my Department to the NRA which allocates it among the local authorities. Maintenance grants by my Department in 2008 amounted to &euro;45.6 million, while &euro;58.21 million was provided through the NRA.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 to 260, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Dublin Port Company was incorporated in 1997 under the Harbours Act 1996.  In accordance with the Act, the company is required to take all proper measures for the management, control, operation and development of the port and is required to conduct its business in a cost-effective <Col N="956"/>and efficient manner.  Advertising expenditure is primarily an operational matter for the company.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of any correspondence received in my Department raising financial concerns regarding the company.  On the contrary, the company has continued to trade profitably over recent years and has paid a dividend to the State for the past two years.</P>
        <P>Since corporatisation, the company has received approximately &euro;6.9 million in public funding.  This funding was in respect of approved port capacity projects under the NDP 2000-2006 and was made available by way of share purchase under the Harbours Act.</P>
        <P>Current policy, as set out in the Ports Policy Statement published in 2005, is that the port companies, as commercial entities, should be capable of funding their operations and infrastructure requirements without recourse to the Exchequer.  There is no Exchequer funding provided for under the port sub-programme of the current NDP.  However, the port companies themselves are projected to spend between &euro;300 million and &euro;600 million on capital projects over the course of the plan.</P>

	<P>The procurement and expenditure activities of the agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are essentially a day-to-day operational matter for the agencies concerned.</P>
        <P>Each agency submits an annual report in compliance with the Code of Practice for the Corporate Governance of State Bodies of which compliance with procurement requirements and maintaining a system of internal financial control are integral components.</P>
        <P>Last month, I wrote to the Chairpersons of the agencies under my remit advising them of a new approach on corporate governance being introduced by my Department and reminding them of their obligations under the Code of Practice.  Since then my Department has written to these Chairpersons drawing their attention to the Department of Finance circulars and instructions concerning travel, subsistence and associated expenses.</P>
        <P>The Chairpersons have been requested to confirm that arrangements currently in place in their respective organisations are in compliance with Department of Finance instructions. In addition, the Chairpersons have been advised that, as part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing corporate governance relationship with their organisations, they will be expected to confirm, on an annual basis, that the arrangements in place in their organisations are in compliance with these Department of Finance instructions.</P>

        <P>The State Airports Act, 2004 provides the framework for the establishment of Shannon and Cork as independent airports.  As part of the airport restructuring process the boards of Cork and Shannon airport are required to prepare business plans for eventual separation.</P>
        <P>All three airport business plans have to be coordinated by the Dublin Airport Authority for eventual approval by myself and the Minister for Finance.  Among the requirements to be satisfied in advance of separation is the need to ensure the financial sustainability of all three state airports.</P>
        <P>I have now received business plans from each of the state airports and I have been in consultation with the three Airport Authorities concerning the approach to the separation of Cork and Shannon having regard to the current economic climate and trends in the aviation market generally.  I hope to announce the outcome of those consultations shortly.  I do not propose to comment on details of the Cork plan at this stage.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year I appointed Peter Cassells Consultants to mediate on the issue of the Cork Airport debt.  The report prepared for this purpose cost &euro;30,250.  The boards of the Dublin and Cork Airport Authorities accepted the outcome of this report.</P>

In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I.

When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.</P>

The revised arrangements in question, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 Scheme, were announced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 15 January 2005 and the Closing Date for receipt of applications was 31 March 2005. The application of the person concerned was received on 18 January 2006 and, as such, was received much too late for consideration. The person concerned was made aware of the non-acceptance of his IBC/05 application by letter dated 25 January 2006.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is participating in the inter-Departmental process, co-ordinated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with a view to reducing by 25% the administrative burden placed on businesses by Government.  It is envisaged that the identification, prioritisation and measurement process should be completed by all Departments by the <Col N="962"/>end of 2009.  On completion of the measurement exercise, simplification plans will be prepared detailing how the 25% target will be met by the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>While it is not expected that my Department will be identified as one of those Departments that imposes the greatest administrative burden on businesses, the work involved to date is currently being carried out as an integral part of the general public policy formation process and other administrative functions within my Department.  It is therefore not possible to isolate the staffing and financial resources involved in the manner requested by the Deputy.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a Garda investigation carried out on behalf of the Garda Ombudsman Commission, which results in disciplinary action being taken by the Garda authorities, prevents the Ombudsman Commission from taking further disciplinary action even if it is dissatisfied with the outcome of the investigation; and his views on whether this is an aspect of the legislation which needs to be amended. </Quest>

	<P>The issue to which the Deputy refers has never been brought to my attention as an operational difficulty.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware that the Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission has never been empowered directly to take disciplinary action against a member of the Garda Siochana &mdash; it is empowered to recommend disciplinary action to the Garda Commissioner. Under section 26 of the Garda Siochana Act 2005 it is the Commissioner who has statutory responsibility for the direction and control of the Garda Siochana.</P>
        <P>As I have previously indicated I intend to bring proposals for legislative change to Government shortly in relation to issues concerning the operation of the Ombudsman Commission, and any case for change on this matter can be considered in that context.</P>

The majority of these seizures (53 (25%) in 2006, 36 (27%) in 2007 and 58 (30%) in 2008) are recorded at Dublin Airport and Pearse Street Station. The offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau are located within Pearse Street Garda District, which would account for seizures recorded there.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to say whether the Passports seized are Irish or from other jurisdictions.  As to determine same would necessitate a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.</P>

I understand that the majority of the issues raised in the correspondence referred to have already been addressed by my colleague, the Minister for Finance. Accordingly, I will address the area for which I have responsibility, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to ratify the UN Convention as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary requirements under the Convention are being met. Ireland was in the first group of countries to sign, subject to ratification, the Convention when it opened for signature on 30 March 2007. An Inter-Departmental Committee has been established by my Department to advise on and monitor the actions required to enable the State to ratify the Convention. The Committee has developed a work programme that is being actively addressed by Government Departments. I might add that the Disability Act 2005, underpinned by the National Disability Strategy, meets a considerable portion of the Convention&rsquo;s requirements.</P>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s 2008 Policing Plan, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, contains the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals to realign Garda Divisional boundaries to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  The planned changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that they are fully satisfied that effective and efficient policing will be delivered in the areas affected by the proposed changes.

	<P>Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007. Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children. With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children&rsquo;s Court.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that from 1 January to 30 November, 2008 479 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 469 to children. There have also been eight formal good behaviour contracts agreed in respect of children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal was established under the Refugee Act 1996 to consider and decide appeals taken by applicants for asylum against recommendations of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  The recommendation in question is a recommendation, set out in a report of the Commissioner on the investigation of the application under section 13 of the Act, that the applicant concerned should or, as the case may be, should not be declared to be a refugee.  Under the legislation, the Minister has no power to overturn a decision of the Tribunal in relation to such an appeal.</P>
        <P>Section 17 of the Act provides that subject to the provisions of that section, where a report under section 13 is furnished to the Minister or where the Tribunal sets aside a recommendation of the Commissioner under section 16, the Minister shall, in case the report or, as the case may be, the decision of the Tribunal includes a recommendation that the applicant concerned should be declared to be a refugee, give to the applicant a statement in writing, referred to as &ldquo;a declaration&rdquo;,  declaring that the applicant is a refugee.</P>
        <P>Subsection (4) of section 17 provides that the Minister shall not give a declaration to a refugee who has been recognised as a refugee under the Geneva Convention by a state other than the State and who has been granted asylum in that state and whose reason for leaving or not returning to that state and for seeking a declaration in the State does not relate to a fear of persecution in that state.</P>
        <P>In addition to the provisions of the Refugee Act, the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 also apply.  The Regulations were made for the purpose of giving effect in Irish law to Council Directive 2004/83/EC (the Asylum Qualification Directive).  Regulation 11 provides that the Minister may refuse to grant a declaration that a person is a refugee where (a) there are reasonable grounds for regarding him or her as a danger to the security of the State, or (b) he or she, having been convicted by a final judgement of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of the State.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the powers which he has to overturn the decision to deport an individual following the exhaustion of all other review processes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The powers of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the area of repatriation are derived from the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended).  Specifically, Section 3(1) of that Act provides for the making of Deportation Orders, Section 3(2) of the Act provides for the circumstances under which such an Order may be made while Sections 3(3) and 3(4) of the Act set out the procedures which must be followed in notifying a person who is illegally present in the State of the Minister&rsquo;s intention to issue a Deportation Order against that person.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that where a person is notified of the Minister&rsquo;s intention to issue a Deportation Order against them, he/she is afforded the opportunity to submit written representations setting out reasons as to why they should not be deported and should instead be granted temporary leave to remain in the State with any such representations being considered <Col N="972"/>under the various headings set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) before a final decision is taken by the Minister in that case.  The Deputy should also note that each individual case must be considered having regard for the provisions of Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. When this detailed consideration has been completed by Department Officials, a recommendation is made to the Minister as to whether a Deportation Order should be made or if, instead, temporary leave to remain in the State should be granted. Where such an Order is made, the enforcement of that Order becomes an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might wish to note that persons notified of the Minister&rsquo;s intention to issue a Deportation Order against them tend to arise from two primary sources i.e. persons whose asylum claims have been refused following the individual assessment of such claims by the two statutory refugee status determination bodies viz. the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and persons who have otherwise become illegally resident in the State arising from the expiry of a Visa or Work Permit or persons identified as having been working illegally in the State.  The Deputy should note that the same detailed consideration process is applied to all cases and regardless of whether or not written representations are submitted.  In light of the above, the Deputy will appreciate that decisions to make Deportation Orders are not taken lightly and indeed such decision making is guided by, among other things, international law and Supreme and High Court Judgments.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s enquiry about possible powers to overturn a deportation decision, Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) specifically provides the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the power to revoke a Deportation Order where circumstances dictate that he should do so.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that any application made under Section 3 (11) of the Act would need to be supported by information or documentation that was not, or could not have been, considered by the Minister in arriving at the earlier decision to make the Deportation Order.</P>

On foot of this development, my officials have requested the GNIB not to enforce the Deportation Order of the person concerned until her daughter&rsquo;s asylum application is determined.</P>

	<P>The person referred to by the Deputy applied for Asylum on 27 February 2006. The claim was assessed by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. The Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation was communicated to him by letter dated 3 May 2006. This communication advised the person of his entitlement to appeal the Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which he duly did.</P>
        <P>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal considered the person&rsquo;s appeal, following which the Tribunal affirmed the Commissioner&rsquo;s earlier recommendation to reject his claim. The outcome of the appeal was made known to the applicant by letter dated 19 November 2008.</P>
        <P>In accordance with normal procedures, the applicant&rsquo;s file has been forwarded to my Department&rsquo;s Ministerial Decisions Unit for final processing of the Asylum claim. A letter will issue to him shortly from my Department advising him formally that his asylum claim has been rejected and affording him three options as follows:</P>
        <P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />Return home voluntarily</P>
        <P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />Consent to the making of a deportation order, or</P>

	<P>The persons concerned entered the state and applied for asylum on the 5th May 2004. They were refused a declaration of asylum on the 17th and 30th January 2006 respectively. Representations for Leave to Remain were received on behalf of the persons concerned on the 6th February 2006, 8 August 2007 and the 18th June 2008. The persons concerned made applications for Subsidiary Protection under the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006) and their applications were refused by my Department on the 23rd September 2008 and 1st October 2008. I considered all of the files of the persons concerned and all representations received before determining to make Deportation Orders in respect of them on the 30th October 2008.</P>
        <P>The persons concerned instituted Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court on the 21st August 2008 seeking an Order of Mandamus that the Minister consider their Leave to Remain application. The persons concerned have now sought a Notice of Motion on the 21st November 2008 to amend their statement of grounds to challenge my decision to make Deportation Orders in respect of the persons concerned and determining that the persons concerned were not eligible for Subsidiary Protection. Accordingly, this case is sub judice and I do not propose to comment further on this matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 to 328, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Most of the information requested by the Deputy is contained in my replies to Questions 301 to 303 of 18th of November 2008, and Questions 343 and 345 of 25th November 2008.</P>
        <P>As regards the additional information now being sought, I can confirm that 20,016 children were referred to the Garda Youth Diversion programme in 2006, and 21,941 in 2007.  Figures for 2008 are not available yet.</P>
        <P>Participant numbers in Garda Youth Diversion projects for the first six months of this year are in excess of 3,800.  A breakdown by project is not readily available at this stage.  There are 100 projects ongoing nationwide.</P>
        <P>The following table sets out the amount allocated in funding to each project in 2008.  Information on expenditure in 2008 is not available as yet.  The position in relation to 2009 is that funding for individual projects has yet to be decided but there is currently an allocation of &euro;20.26 million for community programmes which includes Young People&rsquo;s Probation and Garda Youth Diversion projects.  Information on the number of staff employed in the projects cannot be collated in the time available but will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Finally, I am informed that a total of 38 project applications received in 2008 are being considered in accordance with project guidelines.  The planned expansion in the number of projects beyond the existing 100 is currently being assessed in the light of the changed economic climate and, in this context, the focus will be on ensuring the quality and effectiveness of the services provided.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the United States Deputy Secretary of State, John Negroponte, and I signed a Memorandum of Understanding establishing a new Working Holiday Programme between our two countries in Washington on 24 September.</P>
        <P>Since the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding, my Department, in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment, has moved quickly to finalise arrangements for US citizens interested in working and travelling in Ireland. A comprehensive step by step guide and application form for US applicants has been prepared and distributed to our Missions in the United States. We are ready to begin accepting applications from US citizens, and will do so as soon as the US State Department has finalised its arrangements for Irish citizens.</P>
        <P>We have been actively emphasising to the State Department the need to ensure that the Programme is fully operational at the earliest possible date. In response, the State Department has assured us that it is actively working to finalise its arrangements and will shortly complete this process.</P>

	<P>The cost of implementing and supporting Better Regulation is difficult to quantify in terms of staff numbers or specific budgets, as these obligations fall into much of the day to day work of a number of sections within my Department. There is no separate budget line maintained by my Department for Better Regulation.</P><Col N="983"/>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mary Coughlan, TD, has the lead role in achieving the reduction of administrative burdens on business by 25% and has tasked her Department with coordinating the overall process across Government Departments.</P>
        <P>My own Department has engaged fully with the identification, prioritisation and measurement process, an exercise which all Departments are currently undertaking. Legislation which falls under the remit of my Department has been examined to ascertain whether it contains any regulations which impose an administrative burden on business. My Department has not to date identified any areas of regulation, within our remit, which place an administrative burden on business.</P>
        <P>We will continue to keep this under review and maintain close contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the matter.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am deeply concerned by the escalation in fighting which has taken place in recent months in the northern part of Sri Lanka, including in the Vanni region, and by the humanitarian plight which has affected the people there. The situation has been exacerbated by Cyclone Nisha which hit northern Sri Lanka on 25 November, causing heavy rains and flooding which reportedly forced up to 70,000 people to relocate. Humanitarian assistance to these people has been hindered by the decision of the Sri Lankan authorities in September to order nearly all international humanitarian NGOs to withdraw their staff and operations from the Vanni conflict area. </P>
        <P>Bilaterally, and with our EU partners, we have consistently sought to impress on both the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) the importance of engaging in meaningful peace talks and stopping all violence and human rights violations. We deeply regret the termination of the 2002 Ceasefire Agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE in January of this year. We continue to take the firm view that there can be no military solution and urge all sides to refrain from actions that make a negotiated settlement more difficult to achieve.</P>
        <P>As one of the four co-chairs of the 2003 Tokyo Conference on the Reconstruction and Development of Sri Lanka, the EU too is anxious to maintain an active role in assisting the country to resolve its internal conflicts, work on national reconciliation and move forward on the development agenda. Following a meeting of the Co-Chairs of the Conference on 24 September last, the Presidency expressed again its concern in relation to human rights and the plight of civilian populations isolated by combat in the north of the country. It called on the parties involved to respect the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and noted the obligation of the Sri Lankan Government to ensure protection of its civilians and to meet their needs. In this context, it underlined the essential role of humanitarian organisations and reaffirmed its support for the actions of the United Nations agencies and the international NGOs. Ireland fully supports the terms of this Presidency statement.</P>

This includes significant emergency assistance provided in the aftermath of the tsunami in 2004.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 336 and 337 together.</P>
        <P>I am fully committed to achieving the goals set out in the Action Plan for Better Regulation and believe that improvements in regulation can have a positive impact on the quality of engagement between the public and Government.</P>
        <P>Most of the legislation brought forward by my Department does not impact significantly on the regulatory environment. Regulatory Impact Assessments are, however, carried out on all appropriate legislation.</P>
        <P>Since June of this year, my Department has been involved in preparing a number of pieces of legislation. These have been assessed to establish the likely impact on the regulatory environment. I have set out below, details of the legislation and also the regulatory impact assessments which have been carried out.</P>
        <P>The Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Bill 2008 was signed into law on 2 December 2008. The Bill was brought forward in order to give effect to two international agreements &mdash; the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. As the Bill did not exceed what was required to implement these two international Conventions, and was assessed to have no impact of the regulatory environment, it was determined that no formal Regulatory Impact Assessment was needed.</P>
        <P>The Irish Diaspora Endowment Fund Bill is being put in place to allow the Government to contribute funds to the Ireland Funds. A screening Regulatory Impact Assessment was carried out on this legislation. As the Deputy will be aware, the decision to conduct a full RIA is taken if the initial screening has highlighted possible significant impacts; these are defined as those which have substantial and observable effects either on the economy, on a sector of society or on the environment. In this case, the RIA screening concluded that, as the legislation would not have a significant impact in these areas, a full RIA was not required.</P>
        <P>A Statutory Instrument (S.I No 220 of 2008) was made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 25 June 2008. The Instrument was made under the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991. This Act gives effect to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (23 May 1990). The purpose of the Convention is to establish a system among Contracting States in order to (i) ensure the prompt return of children who are wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State and (ii) ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in the other Contracting State. Given the nature of the Statutory Instrument, it was not deemed to be sufficiently significant for the purposes of triggering a Regulatory Impact Analysis. It does not involve any costs, and its purpose, is, in fact, to facilitate a more efficient application of the said Convention within Ireland.</P>
        <P>Three statutory instruments relating to the Passports Act 2008 came into effect on 1 November 2008 to address associated matters of detail and procedure. One instrument gave the date for the commencement of the Act, another prescribed the period of validity for different types of passports and a third prescribed the time limits for the making and determination <Col N="986"/>of appeals against decisions to refuse to issue or to cancel a passport. A regulatory impact assessment had previously been undertaken on the Passports Bill 2007. Accordingly, it was not necessary to undertake a further regulatory impact analysis on these statutory instruments as they were not significant in themselves and would have no impact on the regulatory environment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 339 to 341, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I remain fully committed to contributing to the achievement of the 25 per cent target for the reduction in administrative burdens on business arising from domestic regulations, as well as to the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) process as an important means of enhancing the quality of political and administrative decision making.</P>
        <P>However, within its ambit, the Department is very much a light regulator, so its contribution to both the burden reduction and RIA processes is correspondingly proportioned.</P><Col N="987"/>
        <P>The Department has actively participated on the Inter-Departmental Group on Administrative Burden Reduction chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and it has been progressing apace the associated burden identification and estimation tasks.</P>
        <P>In whole-time equivalent terms, a modest portion of an Assistant Principal Officer&rsquo;s time is assigned to co-ordinate this work within the Department, with contributory assignments of resources from Divisions across the Department.  In addition, on occasion, as and when required, contributions from senior management, up to and including the Secretary General, are made.  Given the organisationally diffuse nature of these activities, it is not readily possible to estimate the associated financial costs arising from these work commitments.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, RIAs are required to be conducted in relation to: all proposals for primary legislation involving changes to the regulatory framework (subject to some exceptions); significant Statutory Instruments; and proposals for EU Directives and significant EU Regulations when they are published by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Since June 2008, the Department has neither introduced proposals for primary legislation involving regulatory change or significant Statutory Instruments nor dealt with published proposals for EU Directives or significant EU Regulations.  Accordingly, since June 2008, the Department has not conducted any RIAs, whether screening or full, nor was it required to do so.</P>

In relation to my own Department, the process, which is nearing completion, is being carried out on a cross-divisional basis within existing resource levels. Accordingly, it has not been necessary to earmark specific staffing or financial resources for the implementation of the project. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 343 and 344 together.</P>
        <P>Since June 2008, my Department has implemented 4 Statutory Instruments (SIs) of a technical nature, which did not constitute significant regulations and in respect of which neither a screening regulatory impact analysis (RIA) nor a full RIA was considered necessary. The SIs in question were as follows:</P>
        <P>Appointment of Special Advisors (Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs) Order 2008, (S.I. No. 170 of 2008); Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order 2008, (S.I. No. 218 of 2008); Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs Island Connecting Bus Passenger Services (Centres of Population) Regulation 2008; and Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs Island Connecting Bus Passenger Services (Centres of Second Level Education) Regulation 2008.</P>
        <P>In addition, I made regulations (S1 No 391 of 2008) under section 9 of the Official Languages Act 2003 in relation to the use of the Irish language, or the Irish and English languages together, on stationary, signage and pre-recorded oral announcements. A screening RIA in respect of these regulations was carried out in 2006. Having regard to the fact that the regulations would apply only to public bodies, would not be applicable to private individuals or the private sector, and would have a relatively low impact, it was considered that they did not constitute significant regulations, and, accordingly, that a full RIA was not appropriate.</P>
        <P>No Bills or EU Directives were brought forward or implemented during the period relevant to the Deputy&rsquo;s Questions.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, funding for my Department for the year 2009 is reduced by a total of 6%, with current expenditure reduced by 5% and capital expenditure by 8.5%.  </P>
        <P>As previously indicated to the House, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the front-line services provided by, or supported through, my Department &mdash; especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities &mdash; are protected.  This is being achieved by requiring significant administrative savings in my own Department and public bodies within its ambit; through the cessation of the use of intermediary bodies, such as community development support agencies; and by reducing administrative overheads across bodies such as Pobal. The reduction in the administration funding available to Pobal reflects an emphasis on the prioritisation of front-line services over intermediary and ancillary supports.</P>
        <P>In this way, the wide range of services my Department provides, including services under its social inclusion programmes, can be broadly maintained.</P>

	<P>The organisation referred to by the Deputy operates two groups from the address in question. Both of these groups have reached the &euro;30,000 annual funding limit set for any individual group operating the Scheme.  </P>
        <P>This limit is in place to ensure that (i) the Scheme maintains its local focus and (ii) there is a fair distribution of the available resources across the country.  The area in which this organisation is situated has a large number of groups involved in providing assistance under the CSOP and the limit generally only comes into play where groups operate on a wider basis.  I believe that the level of funding available is adequate to meet the needs likely to arise in any one year in any neighbourhood or parish.</P>
        <P>Where a group has received applications which exceed the &euro;30,000 limit in a year, my Department has facilitated passing on the excess to other community and voluntary groups in the immediate area who can ensure that the older person&rsquo;s security needs are met.  If difficulties are experienced in this regard, the group should contact my Department directly.</P>
        <P>In this specific instance, an official from my Department has been in contact with the group involved and has arranged for the required equipment to be installed immediately.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the Health Service Executive (HSE), as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  As advised in my reply of 4th December 2008 to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the same subject, the person concerned has been refused rent supplement as she is regarded as not being lawfully in the State. The person concerned has appealed against the decision to refuse rent supplement to the HSE Appeals Office. She will be contacted directly when a decision has been made on her appeal. </P>

	<P>Disability Allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66. The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both medical assessment and a means test.</P>
        <P>The person concerned made an application for Disability Allowance on 28th October 2008.  The application was referred to a Social Welfare Inspector to determine the means of the claimant and the Inspector has submitted his report. The application was also referred to Medical Review and Assessment Section in October 2008 to schedule a medical examination. The person was unable to attend a medical examination arranged for the 2nd December 2008. He has been referred for another examination but the date has to be finalised by the Medical Review and Assessment Section. He will be notified of the time and place of this examination in January 2008. On foot of the Medical Assessor&rsquo;s report, a final determination on the application will be made and he will be notified directly of the outcome.</P>
        <P>The person is currently in receipt of Supplementary Welfare Allowance.</P>

        <P>The person concerned made an application for Disability Allowance on 22nd October 2008. His application was reviewed initially by a Medical Assessor who determined that the claimant was medically suitable for Disability Allowance. The application was then referred to a Social Welfare Inspector to determine means of the claimant.  The person concerned was visited by the Social Welfare Inspector who assessed means of &euro;244.12 from his spouse&rsquo;s employment. Based on this assessment, this person will qualify for a rate of Disability Allowance of &euro;86.60 per week.</P>
        <P>Arrangements are being made to issue his payment into his nominated bank account on 17 December 2008.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> her views on <Col N="991"/>whether the advice to State non-contributory pension recipients that any portion of the pension saved will be means tested and could result in reduction or withdrawal of the State non-contributory pension is likely to intimidate vulnerable people and to deter savings; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[45979/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>State Pension (Non-Contributory) is a means tested payment and all income is assessable as means.  This includes cash income, private pensions, foreign pensions, the value of any property (excluding the person&rsquo;s own home) and the value of any investments and capital.  A pensioner is obliged to declare all means, and to inform the department of any change in his/her circumstances.</P>
        <P>Where a pensioner chooses to save part of their pension, the capital involved is included in the means test in the same way as savings from any other source.   However, when means disregards are taken into account a single person who has no other means can have capital (e.g. savings) of up to &euro;40,999 and qualify for the maximum rate of pension. A single person can have a capital balance of up to &euro;93,999 and still qualify for a reduced pension.  These amounts are doubled in the case of a married couple.</P>
        <P>The department is committed to delivering a quality customer service and in this regard pensioners are provided with full and clear information on their entitlements and on their obligations.  This includes providing them with detailed information on the income that is taken into account in the means test.    However, it is not intended that this should deter pensioners from saving and given the levels of capital disregards in place it should be noted that most pensioners are not at risk of having their entitlement reduced as a result of making savings from their weekly pension.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the eligibility for children&rsquo;s allowance for an Irish citizen parent of two children residing here who is in receipt of a maintenance payment from their estranged partner who resides in the UK; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[45994/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>A child benefit claim was received from the person concerned in April 2008. According to the information provided, she came to reside in Ireland with her children in February 2008.  She is not employed but her ex-partner is employed in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>Under EU Regulations, the country of employment is responsible for the payment of child benefit.  UK child benefit is being paid to the husband for this reason and because he is maintaining the children. Because the child benefit rate is higher in Ireland than in the UK, in accordance with the Regulations the difference between the two rates, i.e. the supplement, is being paid by this Department to the person concerned.  In this way the family is receiving the maximum rate of child benefit applicable, even though this amount is divided between the two partners.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the average waiting time in each of the social welfare offices operated by her Department in respect of dealing with unemployment payment claims; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[45998/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department delivers a front-line service through a network of Local Offices and Branch Offices countrywide.  The main services provided from these offices include jobseekers payment, one-parent family pay<Col N="992"/>ment and an information service. Branch Offices are operated under a contract for service and decisions on claims taken in Branch Offices are made in its departmental parent Local Office.</P>
        <P>In the past few years the Department has coped with increasing demands arising from significant changes to the social welfare code and in the numbers of persons accessing services. Operational procedures and the organisation of work continue to be reviewed and restructured to maximise the benefits of technology and new developments in processing techniques and business information.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  These conditions vary between the two jobseeker schemes and involve, among other things, the need to establish the person&rsquo;s social insurance record, establish the person&rsquo;s identity or their place of habitual residence and to assess means where appropriate.  In some cases delays arise where the person fails to supply all pertinent information in support of his/her application.</P>
        <P>The overall performance in any individual office in processing claims can be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors; including increased inflow of claims, staff vacancies and the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office.  The average processing time in November in each office is given in the following table.</P>

        <Quest> the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will not receive the Christmas bonus in view of the <Col N="995"/>fact that prior to this period of receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they were in receipt of the back to work scheme allowance following a long period of unemployment; and if this case will be reviewed. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>To qualify for a Christmas bonus while in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance a person must be in receipt of the allowance for at least 390 days.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was in receipt of back to work allowance while in self-employment.  His self-employment ceased and he applied for and was awarded jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance from 4 September 2008.  He was, therefore, in receipt of this allowance for 83 days when entitlement to the Christmas bonus was calculated and accordingly he is not entitled to the bonus on this occasion.</P>
        <P>He was granted a special needs payment of &euro;400 on 4 December 2008, by the Community Welfare Officer.  If he feels that his means are insufficient to meet his needs, it is open to him to contact his local Community Welfare Officer again regarding possible further assistance.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the average waiting time for an appeal to be heard by the social welfare appeals office; and the steps she is taking to reduce this waiting time. </Quest>
        <QRef>[46027/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that during 2007 the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks.  However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to just over 14 weeks.  Processing times for 2008 are not yet available but are expected to be at least of the same order if not higher having regard to a 23% increase in appeals received so far this year.</P>
        <P>The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination by the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors in certain illness related cases and further investigation by Social Welfare Inspectors where required.  Circumstances may also arise, normally outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which have the effect of unduly prolonging the time taken to process appeals. For example, delays can occur where the appellant submits new information or evidence, often at an advanced stage in the proceedings.  In some cases adjournments may be sought by the appellant or his/her representative.</P>
        <P>Having said that, however, I am concerned about processing times for appeals being further increased and, having regard to the current level of appeals awaiting determination, arrangements have been made to appoint two additional Appeals Officers from next January to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.   Furthermore, in the light of the current situation, I am advised that the Chief Appeals Officer is initiating a review of current processes with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals having regard to due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.  While improving processing times remains a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, it is necessary at all times to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 357 and 358 together.</P>
        <P>The Department has not conducted a regulatory impact analysis since June 2008.  There has only been one bill produced by the Department during the period.  Given the time constraints involved, the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, which implemented PRSI and other changes to social welfare legislation arising from the Budget, was not subject to a regulatory impact analysis.  However, the Department undertakes significant ex-ante analysis of these measures.</P>
        <P>In relation to secondary legislation, the RIA guidelines state that only significant statutory instruments are subject to RIA.  In this regard, given that these are largely technical in nature, the Department has not conducted a regulatory impact analysis on a statutory instrument over the period.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>Entitlement to rent and mortgage interest supplement is determined on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case, including accommodation/mortgage costs and the income of the applicant.  Payment of a supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent/mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum weekly contribution which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.  The minimum contribution is currently &euro;13 per week.  This was set in 2004 and represented approximately 10% of the minimum social welfare weekly payment rate at that time. While social welfare payments have risen by nearly &euro;70 per week since then, no upward adjustment has been made to the minimum contribution.</P>
        <P>As part of Budget 2009, the minimum contribution is being increased from &euro;13 to &euro;18 with effect from January 2009 which will represent 8.8% of the basic social welfare weekly payment.  While the new rate of &euro;18 will reduce the differential between the contribution which rent and mortgage interest supplement recipients pay and the contribution payable under the local <Col N="997"/>authority differential rent scheme, it is still significantly less than the minimum rent paid by local authority tenants, which for example, is &euro;24.87 in Dublin city and &euro;26 in Limerick county.</P>

	<P>I proposed to take Questions Nos. 361 to 364, inclusive, together.      The total number of recipients of child benefit at 1 December 2007 was 587,943, in respect of 1,125,360 children. Of this total, 80,038 are non Irish national customers claiming in respect of 146,302 children. The number of recipients of child benefit at 1 December 2008 was 592,416 in respect of 1,136,192 children. Of these 92,744 are non Irish national customers claiming in respect of 169,135 children.</P>
        <P>The Early Childcare Supplement (ECS) is administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The total number of customers in receipt of the Early Childcare Supplement, as of 1 December 2007 was 284,641, in respect of 382,182 eligible children. The figure at 1 December 2008 was 295,388, in respect of 398,667 eligible children.</P>
        <P>A record of ECS payments, by nationality, is not maintained.  However, as the receipt of ECS is dependent on Child Benefit being paid, it can be assumed that the percentage of non-nationals receiving the ECS payment is broadly in line with that receiving Child Benefit.</P>

        <Quest> the cost to the Exchequer of providing the carer&rsquo;s allowance on a non-means tested basis to all persons in receipt of a carers respite grant. </Quest>

	<P>Carer&rsquo;s allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means tested. This ensures scarce resources are directed at those in greatest need. The primary objective of the carer&rsquo;s allowance is to provide income support to low income carers. The carer&rsquo;s allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes. It has been significantly eased over the years, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.</P>
        <P>In June 2005, the respite care grant was extended to all people providing full time care and attention regardless of their means or social insurance contributions. Since then, the grant has also been paid in respect of each care recipient. Budget 2008 increased the level of the grant by to &euro;1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient from June 2008.</P>
        <P>In addition to those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit who are automatically paid the respite care grant in June each year a further 6,370 people have been paid the respite <Col N="1003"/>care grant in respect of 2008. The estimated cost of extending carer&rsquo;s allowance to this group on a non-means tested basis is in the region o f &euro;80 million per year.</P>
        <P>I have no plans at present to abolish the means test for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.</P>

	<P>The Disability Sectoral plan for the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs provides that the Department will complete a national customer satisfaction survey in 2007 for Disability Allowance customers, in 2008 for Invalidity Pension customers and in 2009 for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance &amp; Benefit Customers. The purpose of the survey is to assess customer satisfaction with the services that the Department is providing.</P>
        <P>The Survey of Disability Allowance customers was carried out in June &amp; July 2007. A sample of 1,050 customers who were awarded Disability Allowance since January 2006 were selected at random.</P>
        <P>The survey highlighted that the vast majority of customers are very satisfied with the quality of service provided by Disability Allowance Section.</P>
        <P>The results of the survey was circulated to senior officials of my Department and to the members of the Disability Consultative Forum.  The Disability Consultative Forum meets a number of times a year and is the mechanism whereby my Department consults with organisations representing people with disabilities.</P>

	<P>In its Disability Sectoral Plan, the Department of Social and Family Affairs has undertaken to facilitate participation in education by social welfare customers of working age with disabilities who are most distant from the labour market in order to enhance their employability and assist them in accessing sustainable employment.  The department also committed to enhancing the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process where an education option is considered most appropriate. Consequently, the third level strand of the  back to education scheme is now accessible  for persons participating in the national employment action plan, if they have spent nine months on the live register.  The duration condition for others is twelve months.</P>
        <P>An inter-departmental working group was established to oversee the integration of VTOS income support provision into the Department of Social and Family Affairs while the Depart<Col N="1004"/>ment of Education and Science would provide all educational supports. This was one of the recommendations in the &ldquo;Report of the Working Group on the Review of the Back to Education allowance (BTEA) Scheme&rdquo; which are currently under examination.  In line with commitments in the Disability Sectoral Plan and elsewhere the annual cost of education allowance has been increased to &euro;500.</P>
        <P>The responsibility for mainstream education rests with the Department of Education and Science and the access routes for people applying for second chance education is a matter for that department.</P>

Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and, in that context, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).</P>
        <P>The European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 came into effect on 1 May 2007.  These Regulations transpose EU Directive 2003/4/EC on Public access to environmental information. The process to transpose the Public Participation Directive is already well advanced, with legislation completed to amend the majority of the relevant consent systems.</P>
        <P>The work to amend the remaining outstanding consent systems will be finalised by the Departments concerned as soon as possible.  When this work has been completed I, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will ensure that the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention is submitted to Government and laid before the D&aacute;il as soon as possible.</P>

        <P>The Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000 provide for the making of orders relating to the provision of open seasons for the hunting of protected birds.

        <P>Any holder of a annual Firearm Certificate issued by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, endorsed appropriately to hunt and kill any protected wild bird pursuant to any open season order, whether an Irish resident or a person ordinarily resident outside the State, is permitted to shoot game birds/wild fowl, subject to being entitled to sporting rights over the land in question or being given appropriate permission to use such rights. It is not a requirement for the person to indicate the number of game birds or wildfowl shot.</P>
        <P>Although the hunting of birds is covered in general by the orders providing for open seasons, individual licences are required under Section 30 of the Wildlife Act 1976 (as amended) for hunting on foreshore, lakes and inland waters belonging to the State. There are currently some 2,650 such licences.  While such licences are applicable to the hunting of fauna generally, they are in practice obtained for the hunting of wildfowl, and are subject to the provisions of the open season orders.</P>

	<P>The 2006 Census enumerates 8,751 bedsits, housing 14,480 people. These figures are not further broken down between the private and public housing sectors.  In the Partnership Agreement Towards 2016, the Government committed to updating and more effectively enforcing the minimum standards regulations for the rental sector and recently delivered on this commitment by approving a package of measures.  The phasing out of the traditional bedsit will be a consequence of this package.  A number of elements of this package require amendments of primary legislation and these are being addressed during the passage, through the Oireachtas, of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.  These include increased penalties for non-compliance and the introduction of a more robust sanctions regime.</P>
        <P>Those elements of the package not requiring primary legislation will be introduced through new regulations to replace those made in 1993.  Regulations for this purpose will come into effect generally on 1 February 2009.  However, certain elements of the new Regulations will not come into effect for existing rental accommodation until 1 February 2013 to allow time for the carrying out of the significant remedial work that may be involved in achieving compliance.  The aspects covered by those provisions &mdash; sanitary facilities, heating facilities and food prep<Col N="1008"/>aration, storage and laundry &mdash; will therefore continue to be subject to the relevant provisions of the Housing (Standards for Rented Housing) Regulations 1993 until then, in so far as existing rental accommodation is concerned.  However, any rental properties being let for the first time after 1 February 2009 will have to comply with all the requirements of the new Regulations.</P>
        <P>My Department engaged widely with a broad range of stakeholders during the process of drafting the new Regulations. As part of this process, a full impact analysis of the new Regulations &mdash; including the costs and benefits arising &mdash; was carried out in a Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by the Centre for Housing Research on behalf of my Department. This Regulatory Impact Assessment is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.</P>

The take back systems, on which the Regulations are based, were developed by a working group, established in July 2006, including representatives of the battery industry, retailers, manufacturers, IBEC, SIMI, the waste management sector, local authorities, the EPA.  Transposition followed a public consultation.  A Screening RIA was undertaken as it is a significant statutory instrument, but with relatively low impact.<br />Following completion of the Screening RIA, a Full RIA was not considered necessary as implementation of the Directive would not:</entry>

	<P>The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.  Section 10 of the Act also requires fire authorities when undertaking these functions to have regard to the nature of the fire hazards and the probable incidence and extent of fires in its functional area.  My Depart<Col N="1015"/>ment&rsquo;s role is one of supporting and assisting local authorities in delivering fire services through the setting of general policy and the provision of capital funding.</P>
        <P>In addition Section 26 of the Act requires each fire authority which maintains a fire brigade to prepare and revise plans for fire and emergency operations showing the provision made by it in respect of organisation, appliances, equipment, fire stations, water supplies and extinguishing agents, training, operational procedure and such other matters as may be relevant, and for dealing with operations of an emergency nature.  The making and revision of such plans is a reserved function.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s Housing Policy Statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, reflects the commitment in Towards 2016 to develop a national hous<Col N="1017"/>ing strategy for people with a disability.  Work on the strategy commenced in October 2007 under the aegis of a National Advisory Group, headed by my Department and involving the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, social partners and other relevant stakeholders including the National Disability Authority.  A full list of the membership of the National Advisory Group is set out below.</P>
        <P>The strategy, which will provide a broad framework to inform the future development of local authority Housing Action Plans, will support the provision of tailored housing and housing supports for people with a disability, and have particular regard to adults with significant disabilities and people who experience mental health issues.  Work on the strategy is ongoing with a view to completion by end 2009.</P>
        <P>As part of this focus, and in line with a commitment under my Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan, a suite of protocols governing liaison arrangements between housing authorities and the Health Service Executive is being developed.  These protocols will provide a strategic framework for inter agency cooperation at local level.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive and local authorities, developed a protocol governing liaison between the Health Service Executive and housing authorities on the assessment of the individual accommodation needs of people with a disability, who have been assessed under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 and identified as being likely to require housing support.  This protocol, which has been in operation since July 2007, ensures that there is a smooth and transparent system to facilitate referral between the Health Service Executive and housing authorities in these cases.</P>
        <P>The protocol governing funding arrangements between housing authorities and the Health Service Executive in relation to ongoing support costs for social housing projects provided for people with a disability is currently under development and is expected to be implemented early next year.   A further protocol, to govern liaison between the housing authorities and the Health Service Executive in relation to the strategic assessment of the nature and extent of local housing needs of people with a disability, will be progressed in the context of the development of the national housing strategy for people with a disability.  This protocol will improve the capturing of data in relation to the housing needs of people with a disability.</P>

	<P>In line with the Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005, local authorities are required to carry out an audit of all roads and streets, pavements and pedestrian crossings, public buildings, public parks, amenities and open spaces, heritage sites, public libraries and harbours within their control to identify what remedial action is necessary to make these buildings and facilities accessible to people with disabilities. </P>
        <P>Local authorities are further required to draw up an implementation plan setting out a programme of works within specific timeframes to address the deficits identified in the audit.  The <Col N="1019"/>Plan requires local authorities to prioritise those buildings in their areas which are most frequented by members of the public as well as accessible public footpaths, streets and crossings in urban areas. In drawing up their plans authorities must have regard to funding and staffing resources available to them for implementation and must consult with organisations representing people with disabilities both in the compilation of the audit and drawing up of the implementation plan.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are required to publish their plans and forward a copy to the Department.  To date, 32 implementation plans have been received in the Department. Two more local authorities have yet to submit implementation plans.</P>

	<P>I recently published, for public consultation, the draft Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations, which provide for the distribution of tags for the harvesting of both commercial and angling quotas on a river by river basis in the 2009 season.</P>
        <P>The entitlement to a total allocation of 10 tags for the entire 2009 angling season remains unchanged from 2008.  The revision introduced in the regulations, on the advice of the National Fisheries Management Executive (NFME), provides that anglers should be allocated a maximum of 3 tags for the period 1 January to 11 May in order to protect spring salmon.  The NFME also recommended that during the period commencing 12 May 2009 to the end of the season, tags should be issued by the relevant regional fisheries board in lots of 3 or 4 subject to a maximum of 10 tags per licence holder for the entire season and to the relevant daily bag limits applying.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the proposed changes will have no adverse impact on tourism angling as they are designed primarily to deliver better compliance and control of the tagging scheme, real-time feedback on how the harvest of salmon is progressing to ensure the surplus is not exceeded and will also lead to efficiencies in the purchase and allocation of tags.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 351 of 9 December 2008, the location of the regional pilots for the home energy saving scheme launched in April 2008; the success to date of the pilot scheme; the date the scheme will be launched nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I launched the pilot phase of the Home Energy Saving Scheme in March 2008 in Counties Limerick (excluding Limerick City), Clare and North Tipperary and in Dundalk.  The pilot phase also included a Cluster Strand, which accepted group applicants from anywhere within Ireland.</P>
        <P>The pilot phase has successfully established a strong case for a full national scheme.  It has shown that there is a considerable appetite for such a scheme among not only potential appli<Col N="1020"/>cant households, but also building energy rating assessors, product manufacturers, installers and other market actors.</P>
        <P>The data gathered during the pilot phase confirms that there is an attractive return on investment from upgrading efficiency measures in older homes, both for the exchequer and the householder.  Targeted supports can bring a house from an F-rating starting point on the Building Energy Rating scale to a D2 rating.  This represents an energy saving of up to &euro;700 per year for each house, equating to reduced carbon emissions of 3 tonnes per year.</P>
        <P>I am making &euro;20 million available for the scheme next year and expect to be in a position to make an announcement on the commencement of the national scheme in the near future.</P>

	<P>My Department is fully engaged in the Better Regulation agenda to contribute to the initiative of making it easier to do business in the State and with the State, including the reduction by 25% of the administrative burden on business from State regulation.</P>
        <P>As part of the Better Regulation agenda, administrative burden reduction practice is part of the everyday normal work of staff in all Divisions of the Department.</P>
        <P>Staff resources are not exclusively deployed to deal with this issue due to the fact that it is part of their ongoing workload.  It is not possible, therefore, to disaggregate the costs of servicing the needs of reducing the administrative burden on business due to regulation from overall administration costs.</P>

	<P>Primary responsibility for the mobile phone charges rests with the relevant services providers, operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the Independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</P>
        <P>My role is to formulate regulatory policy to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.  The Deputy may be aware, in addition to consumer protection provisions generally, that it is an offence to overcharge for telecoms services or products under the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act of 2007.</P>
        <P>There is already in place an EU Regulation to protect consumers against excessive mobile phone charges when roaming in other EU Member States.  Ireland strongly supported the introduction of this Regulation.</P><Col N="1021"/>
        <P>Negotiations are currently in progress at EU level to extend this regulation to protect consumers against excessive text charges and to provide for greater transparency measures for consumers.  At the recent EU Telecoms Council of Ministers I strongly supported the initiative by the Commission to extend the Regulation to protect consumers. I look forward to EU Member States and the European Parliament reaching a successful conclusion on these negotiations.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>I have no role in private sector broadband infrastructure investment undertaken by broadband service providers.  However, it is hoped that the facilitation of greater competition in the sector via the introduction of broadband from different technology platforms, will encourage more rapid enabling of all exchanges for broadband.</P>
        <P>I would add that, in addition to fixed landline broadband, otherwise known as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or broadband over telephone lines, broadband services are available from competing service providers over multiple platforms including cable, fixed wireless and increasingly mobile.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the recent decision by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to ban an advertisement from a shop (details supplied); if he has plans to amend the restrictions on religious advertising as contained in Section 41 of the Broadcasting Bill 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Both the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission are independent statutory bodies and I have no role with regard to decisions made by these bodies.</P>
        <P>Section 20(4) of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 (as qualified by section 65 of the Broadcasting Act 2001) and section 10(3) of the Radio and Television Act 1988 provide that broadcasters cannot accept advertisements that are directed towards any religious or political end or have any relation to an industrial dispute.</P>
        <P>The prohibition on religious advertising does not prevent advertisements, which provide information about a religious magazine or periodical being available for sale, or about a religious event or ceremony taking place.  The prohibition does not extend to religious broadcasting; sections 28 and 45 of the Broadcasting Act 2001 explicitly require RT&Eacute; and TG4 to carry religious programming.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that in 2004, the prohibition on religious advertising on radio and television was retained following a lengthy consultation during which over 150 submissions from the public were received by my Department.  There was a strong argument that religious interests should not be able to buy air-time to deliver an unchallenged message, which other interests, through lack of resources, might not be able to match or counter.</P>
        <P>Section 41 of the Broadcasting Bill continues the prohibition on religious advertising but does so in a less restrictive manner.  The provision focuses on advertisements that address the <Col N="1024"/>issue of the merits or otherwise of adhering to any religious faith or belief or of becoming a member of any religion or religious organisation, as opposed to the existing restriction, which relates to advertisements directed towards a religious end.  The section also continues the clarification that permits advertisements, which provide information about a religious magazine or periodical being available for sale, or about a religious event or ceremony taking place.</P>

	<P>I am advised that under the EU Habitats Directive, the River Laune is designated as a salmonid river.  The river catchment is also designated as a Special Area of Conservation for salmon, which is included in the Castlemaine Harbour Special Area of Conservation.</P>
        <P>Consequently, exploitation of the salmon stock of the River Laune is provided for in the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations.  The level of permissible harvest is limited to the identified surplus described by the Standing Scientific Committee, following the assessment undertaken in accordance with the Habitats Directive.  A number of conservation bye-laws of national and local application further protect salmon stocks in the river.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of the reduction of the administrative burden on Department clients has been pursued at EU level. In line with the Health Check review of the Common Agriculture Policy, the Council and Commission of the EU have declared that they will continue with the objective of obtaining further simplification at both farmer and administrative levels of the cross- compliance requirements.</P>
        <P>In March of this year, the Government decided to reduce the administrative burden of domestic regulation on business by 25% by 2012.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for devising the approach and methodology to be used across Government, for coordinating this work across Government Departments and agencies and for reporting to Government on progress.</P>
        <P>At present, my Department is in the process of screening information obligations.  When completed, an exercise in prioritising these information obligations will be undertaken in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and during 2009, measurements of these prioritized obligations will be undertaken. Pending consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, no decision has been taken in regard to funding, if any, required in 2009.</P>
        <P>No staff have been assigned exclusively to this task. The work is being undertaken in addition to ongoing reviews to streamline and simplify the business processes of the Department with a view to easing the administrative burden for both our clients and the Department itself.</P>

	<P>Following the recall of pork products initiated on 6 December 2008, and on the basis of an ongoing evaluation process by my Department and other agencies involved in this issue I confirmed on 10 December 2008 that all the necessary controls are now in place to enable the restoration of supplies of Irish pork and bacon to consumers.</P>
        <P>The purpose of these controls, which were developed over a very short period through decisive and rapid action taken by my Department and other agencies, is to ensure that only pigmeat certified as coming from herds that are completely unaffected by the current feed contamination issue enters the food chain and is supplied to consumers.</P>
        <P>The controls allow those involved in the pigmeat industry to resume the supply and sale of Irish pork and bacon products in which the consumer can have full confidence.</P>
        <P>This is part of a determined domestic and international marketing campaign and all such products on the home market will carry a special label, developed by An Bord Bia, which will confirm that they are perfectly safe to consume and verifies them as having had no association with potentially contaminated feed.</P>
        <P>With regard specifically to the issue of traceability, pigs are currently identified by farm of origin, traceability of pork at slaughter and, on the basis of production batch.</P>

        <P>Prior to the 2009 EU financial year, farmers could choose to have their payments made by cheque or electronic funds transfer into their bank account or an account with a similar type institution. However, as and from the 2009 EU financial year commencing on 16 October 2008, payment by cheque is no longer permitted in accordance with EU Council Regulation 1290/2005, which lays down the rules on the financing and management of the Common Agricultural Policy from 2007 to 2013. The detailed implementing rules for that Regulation, as set out in EU Commission Regulation 885/2006, require that all EU paying agencies, including my Department, must adopt procedures to ensure that payments are made only via electronic funds transfer from the 2009 financial year.</P>
        <P>My Department has notified the new requirement to all farmers on a number of occasions over the past year. An Post have launched a new Postbank service, which will facilitate electronic funds transfer. This service is also available to any Credit Union, which has the appropriate processing facilities.</P>

	<P>The Mussel Seed (Prohibition On Fishing) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 176 of 2008)  provided for the closure of certain areas of the mussel seed fishery having regard to the need to conserve the resource and protect the environment.   The European Communities (Control On Mussel Fishing) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 347 of 2008) provided for the re-opening of the mussel seed fishery from 23 August 2008 as well as the closure of some areas having regard to the need to protect the environment.</P>
        <P>Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) was not carried out in advance of the above Statutory Instruments being implemented as the closures were for environmental reasons and needed to be put in place without delay to comply with the Birds and Habitats Directives.</P>
        <P>A proposal for the Fish Health Directive was introduced in late 2005 and transposed by European Communities (Health of Aquaculture Animals And Products) Regulations 2008 (S.I. No. 261 of 2008).  My Department felt that a RIA was not warranted, as the changes proposed <Col N="1030"/>were not sufficiently significant.  However, extensive consultations with the industry were carried out during the negotiation period and the transposition of the Directive.</P>
        <P>The transposition of the Dangerous Substances Directive in respect of marine finfish farms was completed by the introduction of the European Communities (Control of Dangerous Substances in Aquaculture) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 466 of 2008). An extensive consultation process took place both with the industry and with the general public in advance of the Regulations being settled.  In this regard,  my Department was of the view that a RIA was not warranted.</P>
        <P>The European Communities (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies and Animal By-Products)Regulations 2008 (S.I. No. 252 of 2008) and Diseases Of Animals Act 1966 (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies) (Fertilisers &amp; Soil Improvers) Order 2008 (S.I. No. 253 of 2008) relate respectively to Animal By-Products (ABP) EC Regulation 1774 of 2002 and land spread of organic fertiliser and soil improvers derived from ABP.  Both Statutory Instruments were subject to extensive consultation with industry stakeholders in particular the composting/anaerobic digestion/waste industries.  That consultation was acknowledged as a positive move and welcomed by stakeholders, formal RIA was not considered necessary in light of the technical nature and restricted scope of the Statutory Instruments.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos, 433 to 435, inclusive, 445 to 447, inclusive, 450, 455 to 457, inclusive, 459, 461 and 467 together.</P><Col N="1032"/>
        <P>In accordance with EU legislation, the National Feed Inspection Programme, complimented by the National Residue Monitoring Programme, is part of the overall Integrated Annual Control Plan for Ireland. This involves food and feed and details must be submitted to the EU Commission on an annual basis.  The aim of the controls is to ensure that feedstuffs and feeding practices do not constitute a hazard to human or animal health or the environment.</P>
        <P>The Annual Inspection Programme, involving the carrying out of about 2,400 inspections and the taking of around 1,800 samples per annum for analyses, is drawn up on the basis of potential risk using previous compliance history, the risk potential of the activity, EU co-ordinated controls, the outcome of internal audits and any concerns raised within the industry.  The scope of the Programme includes feed importers, feed manufacturing mills; mineral mixture plants; recycling plants who manufacture feed using unused food of non animal origin; feed retailers, wholesalers and hauliers as well as farms. The Inspection Programme complies with the requirements of the EU and in some instances exceeds the inspection level targets set by the EU.</P>
        <P>The samples are analysed for composition, presence or otherwise of undesirable substances (such as heavy metals, mycotoxins, dioxins); constituents of animal origin; and banned substances such as antibiotics and growth promoters.</P>
        <P>All farm enterprises are registered with my Department as Feed Business Operators under EU Regulation 183/2003, which lays down the requirements for Feed Hygiene.  The blending of feed materials, ranging from &lsquo;top dressing&rsquo; to the incorporation of medicated feeds into feed rations, is an option available to all farm enterprises.  Those enterprises engaged in using medicated feed are required also to be &lsquo;approved&rsquo;, which involves certain additional requirements.  About 850 farms are identified, on a risk assessment basis, for inspection each year.  A large number of these inspections involve the taking of feed samples for analysis.</P>
        <P>The EU Regulation laying down the requirements for feed hygiene clearly states that primary responsibility for feed safety rests with the feed business operator.  That responsibility includes an obligation on the operator to identify, as required under the legislation, hazard and critical control points (HACCP) and ensure that all appropriate actions are taken to eliminate potential risks to the feed chain.  While the use of oil in the generation of feed drying facilities has not, heretofore, caused problems within the feed industry, this aspect is now being pursued with the feed industry and with the relevant Regulatory State Agencies that are involved.</P>
        <P>My  Department is engaged, in conjunction with a number of other State Agencies, in an ongoing overall review of activities associated with the recent dioxin incident and this review will include the Department&rsquo;s annual feed control programme.</P>
        <P>I will now refer to the specifics of the dioxin case where the results of tests carried out by my Department indicated the presence of marker PCBs in pork fat. Having received the results, my Department identified the feed that was the source of the contamination and the farms that received that feed.  The feed was detained on these farms and the animals on the farms had movement restrictions placed on them.  All the feed remaining on the identified farms in the Republic has been transported back to the establishment from which it came.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Communication was received from the Dutch Food Safety Authority on the evening of Friday 5th December, in response to them receiving the Press Release issued by my Department on Thursday 4th December, indicating that they had identified elevated levels of dioxins in pork fat.</P>
        <P>The establishment where the affected feed was manufactured was registered with this Department as a Feed Business Operator under the new Feed Hygiene Regulations which <Col N="1033"/>came into effect on 1 January 2006 and it was inspected in September 2006 and November 2007.  No problems were detected at these inspections.  Product from the plant was analysed in 2008 for the presence of constituents of animal origin and lead.  The sample results were negative.  The establishment was scheduled for an unannounced inspection in December 2008.</P>
        <P>The establishment concerned also has a permit as a recycling plant from Carlow Co. Co. to recycle unused food material.  There is one other such recycling plant manufacturing feed for farmed animals using unused food of non animal origin registered by my Department as a Feed Business Operator. Product from this plant was analysed in 2006 and 2008 for constituents of animal origin and mycotoxins (2006).  The samples were negative.  Apart from the two dedicated recycling plants which manufacture animal feed from unused food, there are a number of other food business operators who supply their surplus food material directly for animal consumption.  These premises are also registered as Feed Business Operators and I am arranging for the information, requested by Deputies Creed and Naughten, relating to inspections of these premises to be collated and made available to them as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007-13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS. Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments.  The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative <Col N="1034"/>checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May. </P>
        <P>Most REPS plans are now prepared using eREPS, the electronic planning system approved and funded by my Department.  As the information in these plans is in computerised format, the administrative checks can be carried out quickly.  However a substantial minority of plans submitted this year were not prepared using eREPS.  Administrative checks on these have to be done manually and are extremely time-consuming.</P>
        <P>An effect of recent industrial action in my Department&rsquo;s local offices was that this process was delayed.  While normal working has resumed in the local offices following the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission, there is still much to be done before the administrative checks are completed.  In these circumstances my Department sought some flexibility from the European Commission which would have allowed payment of those REPS 4 cases which had been fully cleared, but the Commission were not prepared to allow this.  As a result, it is now apparent that REPS 4 payments cannot issue before the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>While I am anxious that the REPS 4 payments should go out as soon as possible, and my Department will make every effort to facilitate this, there are of course still over 48,000 farmers in REPS 3 and just under 16,000 of those have anniversary dates on 1 November and 1 December this year. Staff in my Department&rsquo;s local offices are currently engaged in processing the annual payment applications for these farmers, and I have asked them to make every effort to issue as many payments as possible before Christmas.  I have asked senior management in my Department to give me regular updates on the payment situation.</P>

        <P>An application was received on 24 April 2007 requesting the transfer of 48.36 standard entitlements to the person named under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme.  As already advised in reply to a previous Question, the person named is registered as a herd-keeper, not as a herd-owner and, as entitlements can only be transferred to persons who are herd-owners, it has not been possible to process this application.  The person named has been advised on several occasions of the need to obtain a herd number and has been directed to Galway District Veterinary Office, the body responsible for the issuing of herd numbers for that county. The required documentation was received by my Department on 10 December and is sufficient to allow the person named be designated as the herd owner.</P>
        <P>In addition, as the requested transfer is by way of inheritance, the person named has been requested to submit the standard testamentary documentation relating to inheritance.

        <P>The specific operational obligations are set out in Annex II of the EU Feed Hygiene Regulations (183/2005).  In cases where a feed manufacturer fails to comply with these obligations my Department will, depending on the nature and seriousness of the infringement, issue a warning; detain a product and prohibit its placement on the market; issue a product recall; close down the operation; initiate legal proceedings and ultimately remove the operator from the Register of Feed Business Operators.</P>
        <P>The process used by the food business operator concerned involved the mechanical removal of wrapping material.  There is no evidence to suggest that any residual wrapping material that may be present in the product presents any health or environmental hazards to human or animal health.</P>
        <P>In relation to the registration of feed business operators, there is no legal obligation on feed business operators to hold specific types of insurance policies.</P>

	<P>Following the Government announcement on 6 December 2008 that laboratory results of animal feed and pork fat samples obtained by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) confirmed the <Col N="1038"/>presence of dioxins, the FSAI required the food industry to recall from the market pork products produced from certain pigs slaughtered in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Potentially contaminated pork products will be destroyed by rendering and some consignments have already been destroyed under the supervision of my Department. This material is classified as animal by-products (ABP), the disposal of which is strictly regulated under the ABP Regulation (EC) 1774 of 2002.</P>
        <P>The recalled product is classified as Category 1 ABP under the Regulation and the options available for disposal are either through rendering at Category 1 rendering plants or export for incineration. Negotiations to ensure that this is done in the most cost effective manner are underway with a view to bringing a swift conclusion to this issue. It is envisaged that the disposal process will take a period of weeks as the material concerned is additional to the normal flow of material for disposal.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that following agreement between my Department and the Pig Processing Sector a facility, to a maximum, of &euro;178m has been set aside to fund the scheme for recalled pigmeat product.

        <P>In this period as the routine screening for PCBs showed negative results there was no need to send samples from animal products for analysis for dioxin.  However, to-date twenty samples associated with the present incident have been sent for testing to the UK.</P>

	<P>REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007&ndash;13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS. Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments. The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May.</P>
        <P>Most REPS plans are now prepared using eREPS, the electronic planning system approved and funded by my Department.  As the information in these plans is in computerised format, the administrative checks can be carried out quickly.  However a substantial minority of plans submitted this year were not prepared using eREPS.  Administrative checks on these have to be done manually and are extremely time-consuming.  An effect of recent industrial action in my Department&rsquo;s local offices was that this process was delayed.  While normal working has resumed in the local offices following the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission, there is still much to be done before the administrative checks are completed.  In these circumstances my Department sought some flexibility from the European Commission which would <Col N="1042"/>have allowed payment of those REPS 4 cases which had been fully cleared, but the Commission were not prepared to allow this.  As a result, it is now apparent that REPS 4 payments cannot issue before the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>While I am anxious that the REPS 4 payments should go out as soon as possible, and my Department will make every effort to facilitate this, there are of course still over 48,000 farmers in REPS 3 and just under 16,000 of those have anniversary dates on 1 November and 1 December this year.

	<P>There are currently some 21,000 part-time undergraduate students enrolled in  the university and institute of technology sectors. It is not known how many  of these students would qualify under any extension of the Free Fees Initiative  as this would be determined by the eligibility criteria that would apply to  such a scheme, including for example, residency, nationality, previous higher  education attainment etc.   </P>
        <P>The availability of free fees would also be likely  to impact on future demand for access to higher education on a part-time  basis.  Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that any estimate of costs is  very tentative depending on the range of variables referred to.  Taking account  of these, and factoring in likely growth in numbers and unit cost funding  implications for <Col N="1043"/>colleges, it is estimated that the costs of a scheme could be  in the range of &euro;40m to &euro;100m per annum.</P>

	<P>School building projects are selected for inclusion in the School Building and  Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need.</P>
        <P>My Department achieves this by assessing all applications for large scale  capital funding against published prioritisation criteria. These criteria were  devised following consultation with the Education Partners.</P>
        <P>Under the criteria, individual applications are assigned a band rating which  reflects both the type of accommodation needed and the extent of any deficit  which requires to be addressed. Progress on individual projects is consistent  with the assigned band rating. There are four band ratings overall with band 1  being the highest and band 4 the lowest.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Band 1</i></P>
<P el="0">Band 1 projects address:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The needs of schools in rapidly developing areas.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The provision of specialist accommodation for special needs pupils.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Schools that are structurally unsound.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Rationalisation projects.</P>
     <P el="10"><i>Band 2</i></P>
<P el="0">Band 2 addresses the needs of schools that have a deficit of mainstream  accommodation and or require refurbishment.</P>
     <P el="10"><i>Band 3</i></P>
<P el="0">Band 3 addresses the needs of schools that have no deficit of mainstream  accommodation but that have a deficit of ancillary accommodation.</P>
     <P el="10"><i>Band 4</i></P>
<P el="0">Band 4 addresses the needs of schools that have desirable but not urgent needs.  A new second-level school required for a major developing area would attract a  band 1 rating.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the prioritisation criteria are clear and unambiguous and  that they bring an openness and transparency to the School Building and  Modernisation Programme.</P>
        <P>My Department also publishes the prioritisation criteria attaching to its  devolved capital schemes &mdash; again to ensure openness and transparency and that  funding is targeted at schools most in need.</P>

Neither the report referred to  by the Deputy nor the issue to which it refers formed part of that application.  My Department will contact the school concerned regarding the matter.</P>
        <P>Since the Summer Works Scheme was introduced, over 3,000 projects, costing in  excess of &euro;300 million, have been completed. With so many smaller projects  having been completed over the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008  has been on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also  delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary  school accommodation throughout the country. Accordingly my Department has  focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding  was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme this year.</P>
        <P>However, I recognise the benefits of the scheme in addressing the needs of  schools and I have previously informed the house of my intention to have a  Summer Works Scheme in 2009. The details of the operation of the scheme in 2009  and the level of funding to be made available under the scheme in 2009 are  currently being considered and will be completed as soon as possible. The  Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used  again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of  expenditure on them.</P>

        <Quest> when and the reason the school transport scheme was introduced originally; the amount it cost the Exchequer <Col N="1049"/>in 2005, 2006 and 2007; his views, in view of the fact that car usage has increased since the introduction of the scheme, on whether the scheme should be reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The school transport scheme was established in the late 1960s. From the outset,  the purpose of the scheme was to ensure access to primary and post-primary  education for children who, because of where they live, might have difficulty  in attending school regularly. The scheme, which is operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on  my Department&rsquo;s behalf, currently facilitates the transportation of over  135,000 children, including children with special needs, to primary and  post-primary schools each day. The school transport system is a very  significant operation involving about 42 million journeys of over 82 million  kilometres on 6,000 routes every school year.</P>
        <P>Expenditure on school transport in 2005, 2006 and 2007 was &euro;122.157 million,  &euro;159.684 million and &euro;172.106 million respectively.</P>
        <P>While car usage has increased significantly since the introduction of the  school transport scheme, the scheme aims to provide comfortable and safe  transport for children travelling to and from school. Measures to ensure the  highest standards in this regard include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In recent years the phasing out of the 3 for 2 seating arrangement on both  primary and post-primary services, providing all children with an adult seat  each.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The addition of a considerable number of vehicles to address capacity  shortfalls arising from the decision to  provide each child with an individual seat and the equipping of all dedicated  school buses.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Inspection by Bus Eireann using an independent agency to satisfy itself that  all buses entering the School  Transport Scheme have seat belts fitted to an appropriate standard, agreed with  the Department of Transport.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann has put in place a random vehicle inspection process  conducted by a leading independent external expert in this field.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that proposals for the progressing of the  review of the scheme, including catchment boundaries which is included in the  Programme for Government are well advanced.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 490 and 491 together.</P>
        <P>In general the arrangements for supporting secretarial and caretaking services  in schools mirror those for providing support funding to the schools concerned.  Primary and secondary <Col N="1050"/>schools are funded through capitation grants and likewise  secretarial and caretaking services are funded by grants that are related to  the number of pupils in the school.  The Ancillary Services grant scheme  provides funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and  caretaking services. The scheme is flexible by nature, giving Boards of  Management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking  services are provided.</P>
        <P>In relation to day to day funding for schools I prioritised funding for primary  schools in the recent budget, increasing the standard rate of capitation grant  at primary level to &euro;200 per pupil.  The budget improvements involve an  increase of more than &euro;21 to bring the rate to &euro;200 per pupil and the ancillary  services grant for primary schools will also be improved by &euro;3.50 to &euro;155 per  pupil.</P>
        <P>Taken together, the budget increases mean that primary schools eligible for the  full ancillary services grant will get &euro;355 per pupil &mdash; or almost &euro;25 extra &mdash;  in this school year to cover their day to day running costs.  In 2009, a school  of similar size to the school in question (just over 120 pupils) will receive  an ancillary services grant of almost &euro;19,000. In addition such a school will  receive at least &euro;24,000 in respect of capitation payments. This excludes the  salary of teachers and Special Needs Assistants which are paid by my  Department.</P>
        <P>I clearly will want to improve funding as soon as circumstances permit and I am  confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build  again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner  consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the implications of the loss of substitution cover for a school (details supplied) in Dublin 12 which due to the small size of the school and classrooms will mean that resource teachers from learning support would have to be pulled to cover classes with negative repercussions for children with special needs; and if he will reverse the decision to withdraw substitute cover. </Quest>

	<P>Substitution cover will continue to be provided for all other categories of  absences currently available such as certified sick leave and maternity leave.</P>
        <P>In primary schools there will be substitute cover for teachers on uncertified  sick leave other than on the first day of absence. In a school where more than  one teacher is absent on the first day of uncertified sick leave, substitute  cover will be provided for the second and subsequent teachers that are absent.  In schools with two teachers or less cover will be provided where any classroom  teacher is absent.</P>
        <P>In the period until the end of the school year, there will be a full review of  the substitution and supervision scheme and related matters in conjunction with  the school management bodies and teacher unions with a view to making up the  additional expenditure and thereby ensuring that the budgetary parameters are  met.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Since June 2008 there have been 7 statutory instruments promulgated which  relate to the education sector.</P>
        <P>Four of these are orders of Government; two relate to the delegation of certain  Ministerial functions to Ministers of State at my Department, whilst two others  were made under the provisions of the Public Service Management Act 1997 to  appoint the Special Advisers in accordance with the legislation. None of these  are matters which would come within the parameters of Regulatory Impact  Analysis (RIA).</P>
        <P>One further order was made by the Minister for Education &amp; Science with the  consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform and following a  motion of each House of the Oireachtas. This order related to an exemption to  the Employment Equality Act 1998 to ensure the provision of a specific number  of teacher training positions for the Church of Ireland College of Education.    This is an existing legislative measure which falls to be renewed periodically  and does not lend itself to RIA.</P>
        <P>Of the remaining two orders, both were to give effect to the work of external  bodies.  One was to afford recognition to the Charter of Galway-Mayo Institute  of Technology and the other related to regulations governing elections to the  Teaching Council &mdash; RIA was not considered appropriate in either case.</P>
        <P>Details of the 7 orders are as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Education and Science (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order 2008 (S.I.  193/2008);</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 502, 507 and 524 together.</P>
        <P>The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of  public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and  to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while  protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure  could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included  in the Budget day announcements. Even with the Budget measures in place there  will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</P>
        <P>My Department will be advising individual schools and Vocational Education  Committees in the normal way in relation to their staffing and grant  allocations. The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of  enrolment data that has been received from schools. The staffing allocation  processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New  Year. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools  can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. In  addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates  teaching resources to schools for special needs  and language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of  the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a  teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed  terms of the scheme.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally  the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools  for the 2009/10 school year. I will do this when the allocation processes have  been completed. Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a  transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and  fairly and know where they stand.</P>
        <P>At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to  it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner. Diverting resources in  order to compile either historic information or to create staffing or funding  profiles for individual schools or VECs, information which at this time could  only be speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the  process.</P>

        <Quest> the school year which will be used in determining teacher numbers in a school (details supplied) in County Sligo from September 2009; if the decision will be based on September 2007 enrolment figures or September 2008 enrolment figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the  enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The  staffing allocation for the academic year 2009/10 will therefore be based on  the enrolment figures as of 30 September 2008.</P>
        <P>The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to  a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year. This  process, which includes notification to all primary schools will commence early  in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under  which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing  schedules.  At primary level the final allocation to a school is also a  function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the  retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available  within the agreed terms of the scheme.</P>
        <P>An important consideration in relation to the staffing allocations for schools  is that schools should be treated in an equitable manner. The staffing schedule  operates in a manner that treats schools in like circumstances equally.  I have  a responsibility to ensure that whatever the overall level of allocation the  system for allocating teachers to schools is transparent and fair where  everyone knows where they stand and each school knows that it is getting the  same number of mainstream class teachers as the school up the road with similar  enrolment.</P>

	<P>I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be  made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In  this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most  other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various  impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements and in  view of the ominous financial circumstances that we are facing I am not in a  position to reverse any of the decisions taken.</P>
        <P>Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at this  time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so  significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious. The increase  in my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2009 of over &euro;300 million &mdash; bringing the total to  over &euro;9.6 billion &mdash; is a real achievement in the current climate and the  challenge will be to ensure that this investment is used to maximum effect.</P>
        <P>I have made it clear in briefing material published on the 2009 Estimates for  the Department of Education and Science that overall, the number of  post-primary teachers in schools in September 2009 is projected to be about 200  fewer compared to September, 2008.</P>
        <P>The allocation processes include appellate  mechanisms under which schools can  appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. This is  particularly relevant at post-primary level where the appellate process  considers in particular any specific curricular needs of the school concerned.  In addition discrete allocations are made to post-primary schools for example  to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language  difficulties.</P>
        <P>I have already put it on record that I have no difficulty in setting out for  this House or for the public generally what the final impact will be on the  overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school  year. I am not claiming in any way that there will be no impact on the staffing  position in schools generally but this will vary from school to school and  there will be schools where the number of teachers will remain the same.</P>
        <P>For the moment the priority for my Department is to move ahead with the  allocation processes and begin the interaction with individual schools early in  the new year.</P>

	<P>Notwithstanding the increase of &euro;302 million in the Education budget for 2009,  which is a real achievement in the current <Col N="1057"/>economic climate, a number of tough  and difficult decisions had to be taken. These decisions included reductions on  the aid for school books scheme.  From 2009 this grant will be available only  to schools within the DEIS scheme.   Three schools under the management of  County Galway VEC are designated included in the DEIS scheme and will continue  to receive funding for school books.</P>
        <P Just="Left">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) is the action plan for  educational inclusion and focuses on addressing the educational needs of  children and young people from disadvantaged communities.  Approximately &euro;7  million was made available in 2008 to DEIS schools for the school book grant  scheme and this fund of &euro;7 million will be made available for distribution to  schools in the DEIS programme in 2009.  The continuation of the school book  grant to these schools is testament to the Government&rsquo;s determination to  prioritise social inclusion and protect the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
        <P>The Department continues to urge schools to implement book rental schemes as a  measure to minimise the cost of school books to all parents.  This was the  recommendation of a consultancy report, submitted to my department in 1993,  which dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text  books.  The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number  of useful suggestions, including a Code of Good Practice for successful  operation of book rental schemes.  My Department fully endorses the report&rsquo;s  recommendations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Whole-school evaluation (WSE) is a model of external evaluation for primary and  post-primary schools that was formally introduced during the school year  2003/2004. WSE provides an external view to a school on the quality of its work  and advice on how that work could be strengthened and improved.</P><Col N="1058"/>
        <P>In the 2004-2008 period, whole-school evaluations were conducted in 241  post-primary schools as follows: </P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2004 &mdash; 12 WS;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2005 &mdash; 53 WS;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2006 &mdash; 57 WSE;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2007 &mdash; 59 WSE;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2008 &mdash; 60 WSE.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Details of the schools in which a WSE was conducted during the 2004-2008 period  are in the following table.</P>
        <P>As the Inspectorate is part of the Department of Education and Science, all  costs associated with its work are paid from the administrative budget of the  Department. Whole school evaluations form just part of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s  business plan in any given year. In addition, inspectors are also involved in a  wide range of other work such as subject inspections, programme evaluations,  the preparation of composite and thematic evaluation reports on aspects of  educational provision in schools, participation in appeal boards established  under Section 29 of the Education Act, and in contributing to policy  formulation and development in areas such as teacher education, special  education, and curriculum and assessment policy. It is not possible at present  to separate out the costs specifically associated with whole school evaluations  from other evaluations and from other costs incurred in carrying out the wider  range of duties undertaken by inspectors. In 2007, there were 159 primary and  post-primary inspectors at various grades and the total gross salary cost for  2007 was &euro;13,450,363. The total travel and subsistence expenses paid, in  accordance with Civil Service rates, in 2007 was &euro;1,688,886.</P>
        <P>Whole-school evaluation is designed to encourage a culture of improvement and  an emphasis of the quality of provision in schools. It does so by providing an  external perspective on the quality of the key aspects of the school&rsquo;s work  including its management, leadership, teaching and learning. It seeks to affirm  good practice and constructively identify areas for improvement. In doing so,  whole-school evaluation complements the self-evaluation and school development  planning carried out by the school (and in post-primary schools, on the  development and self-review carried out by individual subject departments). It  also provides a rigorous evaluation of the work of the school.</P>
        <P>Since Feb 2006, all reports arising from WSE (as well as subject and programme  inspections and evaluations of centres for education) are published on the  Department&rsquo;s website. A total of 129 WSE reports on post-primary schools have  been published since June 2006. The publication of inspection reports in this  way ensures that the school community including parents, as well as other  schools and the general public, have access to meaningful information on  quality and standards in the education system. It also enables the school  community to contribute to implementing the recommendations made by the  inspection team. As part of the publication process, the school&rsquo;s board of  management is also offered the opportunity to respond to the inspection report  and set out how it intends to use the report to improve provision in the  school.</P>
        <P>An evaluation of the impact of WSE in each of the individual schools listed in  the table has not been carried out. However, the Inspectorate has  commissioned an independent review of the effectiveness of its work in schools.  This customer survey, conducted by MORI in 2005, found that of teachers who had  had recent experience of inspection, over 89% agreed or <Col N="1059"/>strongly agreed with  the statement that &ldquo;strengths as well as opportunities and recommendations were  identified&rdquo; during the inspection; over 86% agreed or strongly agreed with the  statement that &ldquo;feedback and advice were given in a supportive and constructive  manner&rdquo;; 80% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that &ldquo;inspectors  provided constructive advice about ways of improving educational provision for  pupils;&rdquo; and over 80% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that  &ldquo;written reports were clear and provided me with valid and constructive  recommendations for development.&rdquo; The same survey conducted among principals  whose schools had recently experienced inspection found that over 87% of  principals agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that &ldquo;inspectors  provided constructive advice to the school about ways of improving educational  provision for pupils;&rdquo; and 91% of principals agreed or strongly agreed with the  statement that &ldquo;written reports were clear and provided the school with valid  and constructive recommendations for development.&rdquo; Evidence from the school  responses submitted by school management in response to the individual  inspection reports listed for the deputy shows that in many cases, schools had  either planned to implement recommendations or had already commenced doing so.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the implementation of improvements suggested by the  inspection lies primarily with the board of management, principal and staff of  each school. In some cases, schools may seek the assistance of school support  services to assist them in implementing some changes. My Department deals,  through its Schools Division, with the very small number of cases where very  serious weaknesses are pointed out by the inspection. In such cases, it is  sometimes necessary for my Department to engage with the patron, trustees or  management of the school to ensure that the need for improvement and change is  fully appreciated by the school and those responsible for its management.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 512 to 514, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware I have recently established a Technical Working  Group under the Commission on School Accommodation to undertake a full review  of the criteria and procedures for the recognition of new primary schools,  including Gaelscoileanna. This working group will begin work shortly and it is  expected that the review of procedures for recognising primary schools will be  completed and revised arrangements in place within a two year timeframe. All  the partners in education will be represented during this review process,  including an Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta.</P>
        <P>In the interim period it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools,  except in areas where increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in  existing schools and which require the provision of new schools. This means  that new schools will not be established for reasons not related to demographic  growth in areas where there is already sufficient school accom<Col N="1065"/>modation or where  increases can be catered for by extending existing school accommodation. It, of  course, remains open to existing schools to apply for capital funding under the  Department&rsquo;s large scale Capital Building Programme to cater for long term  accommodation needs to meet increasing demand for places. All such applications  are assessed in the context of the existing and projected demographics of an  area.</P>

        <P>The further progression of the acquisition of the site will be considered in  the context of the capital budget available to the Department for school  buildings generally.

	<P>Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief, at the  standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at  approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate  and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and postgraduate courses in non-EU  countries.</P>
        <P>An approved college in the State, in relation to a year of assessment, is  defined under Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 to mean a college or  institution of higher education in the State which (i) provides courses to  which a scheme approved by the Minister under the Local Authorities (Higher  Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, applies, or (ii) operates in accordance  with a code of standards laid down by the Minister.</P>
        <P>The college referred to by the Deputy has applied for approval for tax  relief.   However, it would appear from the information provided by the College  to date that the College does not meet the definition of an approved college  for the purposes of Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 and this has  been confirmed to the College by the Higher Education Training and Awards  Council (HETAC).</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department is at the fore front of design with respect to energy efficiency  in school buildings.  Its Technical Guidance Documents, which set the  benchmark for low energy design in schools are clearly focused on energy  efficiency and are based on solid energy research projects.  It has been  demonstrated that all Primary School&rsquo;s designed and built in line with this can  have an energy performance that is 2.3 times more efficient than International  best practice and nearly five times more efficient than schools built in the  late 80&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with over  thirty research projects at various stages currently in hand.  A hybrid  approach is taken with respect <Col N="1067"/>to low energy design in schools based on  maximising natural resources and energy efficient technologies. Schools are  positioned to maximise gain from the sun during the day for passive solar  heating and natural daylight. Passive solar design saves 20% of early morning  heating period and adequate natural daylight when combined with automated  lighting systems in the classrooms can eliminate the need for electrical light  for up to 80% of the schools teaching hours.</P>
        <P>Energy efficient boilers and individual room temperature controls combined with  a strong emphasis on air tight testing and high insulation levels minimise heat  requirements.</P>
        <P>The performance of my Department in the area of low energy design has been  recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy  awards for excellence in Design and Specification.</P>
        <P>A programme for thermal improvements in existing schools is currently being  developed and the Planning and Building Unit of my Department is developing a  technical and administration guidance document that will provide school  authorities with the necessary criteria and specifications to implement an  insulation programme. Case studies will also be provided.</P>
        <P>In addition, an Energy Management Guide for Schools is being developed in  partnership between my Department and Sustainable Energy Ireland and this will  be available on line in early 2009. This guide will be specifically directed to  schools and will provide school managers with advice and guidance on how to  improve energy management within the school and thereby reduce costs.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the recent budgetary announcements do  not affect the criteria used for the allocation of additional teaching and care  resources in Special Schools.  Capitation funding for Special Schools has also  been increased bringing the top rate up to almost &euro;1,000 per pupil.</P>
        <P>I am particularly pleased that, in order to strengthen and enhance services,  and continue the preparation for the full implementation of the EPSEN Act at a  later date, the Government has provided &euro;20m in 2009 &mdash; &euro;10m for education  services and &euro;10m for health services.</P>
        <P>In my Department this additional funding will provide for an expansion of the  NEPS service, so that all schools in the country will be covered by the  service, as well as enhancing the capacity <Col N="1068"/>of the NCSE to co-ordinate the  provision of services to children with special educational needs. In addition,  there will be further investment in teacher training in this area.</P>
        <P>An integrated approach is being adopted by the education and health sectors to  target these additional resources to the areas of greatest need. Progress in  both sectors will be kept under review by the Office for Disability &amp; Mental  Health and the Cross-Sectoral Team during 2009.</P>

	<P>I understand that the initiative referred to by the Deputy is the Certificate  in Contemporary Living which is delivered by the National Institute for  Intellectual Disabilities (NIID) in Trinity College. This is a two-year,  full-time programme which commenced in October 2005.</P>
        <P>The Certificate programme aims to promote the full inclusion of individuals  with intellectual disabilities by providing them with the strategic skills to  become independent self-reliant adults and to facilitate their lifelong  learning. Career development is an integral part of the course.</P>
        <P>The NIID received funding from my Department under the second cycle of the  Strategic Innovation Fund in February 2008 to develop this programme across a  number of higher education institutions. The development of the programme in  collaborating institutions will involve institutional visits and mentoring of  the institutions staff from staff associated with the established TCD  programme. This will ensure that the project is consistently monitored to  ensure best practice in the field.</P>
        <P>UCC is the first collaborating institution and it will pilot the first module  in January 2009, and the programme is expected to commence in the 2009/10  academic year. Other institutions have expressed an interest and it is proposed  to commence pilot programmes next year in Dundalk Institute of Technology and  Sligo Institute of Technology.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy was informed in response to a D&aacute;il Adjournment on the 11th  December, 2008, the Office of Public Works, OPW, which acts on behalf of the  Department in site acquisitions generally was requested to source a greenfield  site for the school in question. However, on foot of advertising, no proposals  were received for a greenfield site in the Cabra area.</P>
        <P>Further to this, the OPW was requested by the Department to look into building  a permanent school on the existing temporary site. In order to pursue this  further, meetings have taken place between the Department and Dublin City  Council regarding the potential availability of this site.</P>
        <P>The Department has written to the council with a proposal suggesting a lease  arrangement be put in place. A response is awaited. When the Department has  received that response, it will be in a position to consider the next steps. It  will continue to liaise with stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The further progression of the acquisition of the site will be considered in  the context of the capital budget available to the Department for school  buildings generally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the concerns raised by the school referred to by the Deputy. The  Government&rsquo;s commitment to education is clear both from its track record over  the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably  extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the  Government set for itself when it came into office.  A lot has changed in the  past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public  finances. It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put  ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.</P>
        <P>However we are dealing with an economic situation of unprecedented difficulty.  The Government has a collective duty to respond to this and to take very  difficult decisions in the national interest. In doing this we have attempted  to afford some shelter to the education sector but given the scale of public  expenditure on education it is simply not possible to avoid tough decisions.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day  announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a  significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</P>
        <P>I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that  they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic  stability of the country. I have called for co-operation from all the education  partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and  as a country.</P><Col N="1070"/>
        <P>It is a matter for each school&rsquo;s Board of Management to have an enrolment  policy and to then operate that policy in a fair and consistent manner having  regard to the overall physical space capacity of a school. My Department has a  responsibility to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for  all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not  obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. That is no more than a  normal feature of the enrolment process in any community.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to ensure that those schools with the greatest  increase in pupil numbers will still qualify for developing school status thus  enabling them to get their increased staffing in September 2009 &mdash; a year in  advance of other schools.</P>
        <P>The Forward Planning Section of my Department is currently in the process of  identifying the areas where significant additional school accommodation will be  required at primary and post-primary level. Factors under  consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and  projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of  existing schools to meet demand for places. Having considered these factors  decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within  an area.</P>
        <P>The demand for junior infant places in the area in question will be considered  within this context.</P>
        <P>What is not acceptable is that any school authority would in the coming year  alter its approach to enrolment simply because it wants to pressurise the  government or to give support to a campaign being conducted by a teacher union.</P>
        <P>As I have already pointed out in the House in recent weeks the changes to the  classroom staffing of primary schools reverts schools to the position that  applied just over one school year ago. Schools are given teaching resources  commensurate with their enrolment and under the staffing schedule schools with  like enrolments are  treated in the same way. In terms of accommodating pupils I believe it is  totally reasonable to expect schools to operate from next September no less  favourably than they did in 2006/2007.</P>
        <P>Any school acting dishonourably in this regard must ultimately answer to its  local community and to the parents and children in that community in particular.</P>
        <P>In terms of the staffing implications at school level the allocation processes  including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year. The  allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal  against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final  allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment  panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a  new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</P>

The Government has a collective duty to respond to this and to take very  difficult decisions in the national interest. In doing this we have attempted  to afford some shelter to the education sector but <Col N="1072"/>given the scale of public  expenditure on education it is simply not possible to avoid tough decisions.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day  announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a  significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</P>

I have called for co-operation from all the education  partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and  as a country.</P>
        <P>My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation  to their staffing and grant allocations. The preparatory work for this has  commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from  schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools  will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers  my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs  and language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of  the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a  teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed  terms of the scheme.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the abolition of a number of grants for some schools will  impact on funding levels in 2009 but it is also the case that the enhanced  levels of funding announced in the Budget for the capitation and ancillary  services grants will help to alleviate the impact of this.</P>
        <P>The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall  level of funding for the day to day running costs of primary schools which will  see funding increase from &euro;167 million in 2008 to almost &euro;190 million in 2009.  The Government is committed to making further improvements as resources permit.</P>
        <P>Substitution cover will continue to be provided for all other categories of  absences currently available such as certified sick leave and maternity leave.</P>
        <P>In primary schools there will be substitute cover for teachers on uncertified  sick leave other than on the first day of absence. In a school where more than  one teacher is absent on the first day of uncertified sick leave, substitute  cover will be provided for the second and subsequent teachers that are absent.  In schools with two teachers or less cover will be provided where any classroom  teacher is absent.</P>
        <P>In the period until the end of the school year, there will be a full review of  the substitution and supervision scheme and related matters in conjunction with  the school management bodies and teacher unions with a view to making up the  additional expenditure and thereby ensuring that the budgetary parameters are  met.</P>
        <P>I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build  again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner  consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</P>
