	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>The information sought by the Deputies concerning appointments made by me to State boards and agencies under the aegis of my Department since June 2002 is set out in a schedule which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  The relevant bodies are the National Statistics Board, the Law Reform Commission, the National Economic and Social Development Office, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum.</P>
        <P>The members of State bodies under the aegis of my Department are appointed through well established nominating procedures, having regard both to the remit of the bodies and, consequently, the particular competencies and skills expected of their members.  In many instances, the members are nominated through relevant nominating panels.  NESC and NESF, for example, comprise representatives of the various pillars involved in social partnership, namely, employer bodies, trade unions, farming organisations and community and voluntary organisations.</P>

</table>      </Speaker><Col N="434"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have three questions for the Taoiseach arising from his reply.  I understand that the Green Party, whose Members are not here at present, has written to organisations asking for nominees for green appointments to State boards.  Obviously this means there is a carve-up within the Government as regards these appointments, with one party getting three, another one or whatever.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether that is the case because these absent Members were very vociferous and most vocal about all State appointments for a number of years when they sat on the benches behind us? </P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the time has perhaps come when the important chairmanship and chief executive positions should be overseen by the relevant D&aacute;il committee?  I am not suggesting that candidates should be overseen in the investigative sense but that the committee would have explained to it why the candidates believe they have a contribution to make and why their qualifications make them feel eligible for the position on offer.</P>
        <P>The case of a county councillor from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party was referred to the Garda following an investigation by the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I do not know what will emerge from this, there may be a prosecution.  In another case, an appointee to a State board is under investigation for an alleged assault, but I cannot predict the outcome.  Does the Taoiseach believe that, where such instances occur, the persons involved should step aside until the investigation is complete?  Does he believe this would be good for the individuals concerned and for the companies they represent?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked whether appointments to State boards are divided between Government parties.  That is not the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Our crowd used to have that, with the few appointments we had.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Give them whatever they want.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Appointments to boards are made on the basis of knowledge, expertise and experience that individuals can bring to the work of the boards.  In many cases, appointments are made on the basis of nomination by relevant groups, such as the social partners.  I have listed all the groups.  In so far as there is a breakdown &mdash; it is not between political parties &mdash; it is evident in respect of NESC, for example, which has been in existence for a long time.  Five of its board members are nominated by agriculture and farming organisations, five by business and employer organisations, five by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and five by community and voluntary organisations.  Five are nominated independently by the Government and Secretaries General of various Departments are included.  There is a breakdown and it is the same with the NESF and the NCPP, although the process is slightly different.  It is certainly not done on a political basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Definitely not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>They have been writing to organisations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not know that.  The position is not like it was at one time, when people were queuing up to be on State boards.  One must work long and hard to try to get highly competent people to sit on State boards nowadays&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because of corporate governance and time commitments.  The political identity of a large proportion of people appointed to State boards would not be known, and <Col N="435"/>rightly so.  The appointees are appointed on the basis of their expertise in society, and this is increasingly the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe even friendship in the appointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a bit of that too, but only on the basis that they are highly competent people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Friends.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To be frank with the Deputy, in respect of all the main boards &mdash; most of them are smaller boards now &mdash; one would not survive on a board for too long without the necessary expertise and competency.  I refer in particular to the commercial State-sponsored boards, which are the main boards.  They have large budgets and staffs, audit committees and high governance levels, and it is difficult enough to recruit people who are prepared to offer their time and service to the State.  Normally people who are very high ranking in their own businesses or companies, or who are of a certain age, are sought.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s second question, some thought has been put into the issue of involving committees of the House in examining appointments to some boards.  Some of my colleagues will try to bring forward proposals in this regard.  I do not think it will be too long before the Deputy will see some of those proposals.  We will leave it to the Ministers to explain how precisely it will work.  Some of my colleagues wish to involve committees &mdash; I think this has been debated in the committees &mdash; so that rather than being from a party political position it will be from membership of committees.  I think it is worth trying anyway and seeing what happens.  A few of my ministerial colleagues will try to pilot this and bring it forward shortly.  I will leave it to them to go into that in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach stepping aside?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of people on boards have raised this question with me over the years.  I do not want to get into names but I have seen a number of them step aside.  However, overwhelmingly, whether they did or did not, it would be entirely wrong because most of the insinuations made about them subsequently &mdash; usually not long afterwards &mdash; turn out to be wrong.  There are a few cases in point at the moment where it would be an absolute travesty of justice if they stepped aside because they prove to have absolutely nothing in them.  I do not really think we should get into that.</P>
        <P>There is a problem in this country as against other countries.  We have to change our culture.  Stepping aside in this country means the person steps aside forever.  It is about the only country where that happens.  In every other country one steps aside for a few months and then steps back.  That culture does not exist in this country &mdash; wrongly so in my view.  It applies to politicians and it applies to people on boards and agencies.  If somebody for some reason steps aside then he or she should not be gone out of a position forever, particularly people who have a lot to contribute especially to State boards.  We have had a few significant people on State boards who did that over time and never came back again.  I think that is wrong.  Just because somebody takes off with some allegation &mdash; in this country most of the allegations are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Taoiseach was going to propose a new concept for his own position, that he was not going to go away for good and would come back again in a few months.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="436"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I totally exclude myself.  I am thinking more of boards and the like.  In the seven or eight I know of &mdash; I am talking about ones in the past that are gone and finished &mdash; I think in all cases they were totally innocent of anything that was said about them.  That would have happened across the party political system.  Obviously for something that is very major and is very clear-cut, then there is a case.  However, in most of these things there is not.  I have seen things involving people in business and people involved in allegations that were made about people.  They invariably tend to be wrong and are wrong.  I am not big into that, in fairness to the people involved.</P>
        <P>More important, it is good that we are now seeing more representative bodies and groups in legislation.  I repeat what I have said here a number of times on Question Time.  In recent years the capacity of the Executive to get the right people to be on the main 20 boards and to give of the necessary time to corporate governance and other issues is increasingly difficult.  I want to thank all those who give that time commitment.  In the modern world it is not maybe as it was 25 years ago where people might have attended a board meeting once a month.  Increasingly these boards have sub-committees, audit committees or corporate governance committees where people are asked to give a large number of hours.  Deputy Kenny knows as well as I do that many of these people never even draw down what are the relatively small amounts that are given to them &mdash; they do not bother with them.  So it has nothing to do with that.  Sometimes they do it for the prestige although I am not sure there is much prestige anymore.  I think people just do it in the interests of public service and we appreciate that.</P>
        <P>The idea of involving the committees is something that some of my colleagues are going to have a go at.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that.  It would be in the interest of the incumbents or the proposed appointees to be able to appear before an Oireachtas committee and give their view as to why they feel they would have a contribution to make.  They can give an assessment of why they feel qualified to do the job.  I agree it is difficult to get good people to serve on State boards and members of the Government must trawl through lists of names on the same panels regularly.  The involvement of Oireachtas committees in this would be beneficial as it would be a public process and would allow those taking up duties to explain how they feel they can make a contribution to the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add that that should not rule out members of committees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the final occasion on which we may question the Taoiseach on his appointments to State boards.  Did I hear a sigh of relief?</P>
        <P>Has the Taoiseach ever seriously considered the arguments put forward by this Deputy and others in favour of a more open and transparent system of appointments to State boards?  Would the Taoiseach consider advertising vacancies, inviting applications for consideration and holding interviews, with appointments to follow?  This is fairly standard stuff; has the Taoiseach given it consideration?  In response to my questions on this subject, the Taoiseach has previously acknowledged that there are people who have the required expertise, interest and willingness to serve but are not identified on the Richter scale that is currently being employed when choosing possible appointees.  If the Taoiseach has not given this consideration, would he, on concluding his responsibilities in this area, commend to his successor that consideration be given to such a system across the board?  I believe it would produce a fairer, more interested and responsive body of citizens than the current limited cadre of people who are considered.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, Ministers and Ministers of State are subject to a code of conduct for office holders and Deputies and Senators are dealt with in ethics legislation.  Is there a comparable <Col N="437"/>arrangement relating to members of State boards?  If not, does the Taoiseach feel consideration should be given to this matter as such appointees hold important, responsible positions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have said this before but it may be worth repeating.  The view on State boards, for which I have been responsible for the past 11 years, is mistaken.  One could take any State board as an example.  The National Statistics Board is chaired by Professor Brendan Walsh of University College Dublin and also includes Dr. Patricia O&rsquo;Hara of the Western Development Commission, two officials from the Department of Finance, one official from the Department of the Taoiseach, two officials from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, two representatives of the farming pillar, two representatives of the business pillar and an <i>ex officio</i> member from the Central Statistics Office.  One can examine practically all of the boards to see that their memberships are drawn from a huge pool including employers, trade unions and voluntary pillars.  The organisations involved, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and farmers, nominate people from thousands of members, hundreds of thousands of members in the case of trade unions.  With practically all of these boards, my right as Taoiseach to appoint board members is nil.  In some cases, it is just to appoint an official.  That is the way throughout all State boards.  It has moved on.</P>
        <P>That applies to most boards and is set out in legislation.  I cannot recall nominating anyone to a board under my aegis.  I am sure I must have somewhere in the past 11 years but the view that I am there with a list is not the case.  These are all people nominated by a huge panel.  On some of these boards there are members of all parties, including Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s.  To be honest, if I were picking I probably would not choose them.  However, that is not what happens.  There are two nominating bodies so it could not be more open or expansive.  To find some other system that would be more restrictive and not allow a huge broad trawl would work against what the Deputy is requesting.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has a mistaken view of how the system operates.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach did not respond to my question on a code of conduct or ethics legislation applying to members of State boards.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach quipped as to what he would like to do with people associated with Sinn F&eacute;in getting on to these boards.  Does the Taoiseach recall that he has acknowledged, both in the House and outside it, that he has appointed friends of his to such positions?  I recall that distinctly.  I am sure they were all deserved appointees but I do not believe we can erase what has been acknowledged in the past.</P>
        <P>My view has nothing to do with the political association of any appointee but that there is transparency in the process.  Will the Taoiseach accept the validity of the argument for a simpler system?  There are many people, who others will never identify, who might bring good sense and a particular expertise to these positions.  The only way to achieve this is to leave the process open for people to present their credentials.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach advise as to what steps could be taken to further ensure gender equality in appointments to State boards?  I refer to the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, as an example.  Should more be done to ensure a 40% achievement for either gender on these State boards, particularly with the NESC?  What does the Taoiseach believe should be done in this respect?  What steps has he taken to address the serious imbalance in representation along gender lines on State boards?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is an ongoing issue to try to improve the gender balance on State boards.  I acknowledge that the broad social partnership process has improved on this in recent years.  The percentage is far higher than it was.  In the cases of NESC, the National and Economic <Col N="438"/>Social Forum, NESF, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, NCCP, which are all under my Department, the gender balance ratio is about 60:40.  It is always a battle to get the nominating bodies to ensure they take gender into account.  In some other boards, it has improved substantially and is still improving.  However, it will never be perfect unless continual pressure is put on.  In most nominating bodies, the ratio is higher.</P>
        <P>On the issue of governance, there are strict corporate governance rules, codes, audit rules and various procedures with which people on boards must comply.  They are even tighter in respect of commercial State bodies under company law legislation.  Boards are all subject to strict scrutiny and must comply with statutory and non-statutory codes that have been changed many times in the past ten years, always making the requirements tighter.</P>
        <P>Under my aegis competent, capable and efficient people who have done an excellent job have been appointed to boards, but the process in respect of all of the bodies under my aegis is enormously transparent and open, possibly with the exception of the Law Reform Commission, membership of which requires expertise.  One cannot be a commissioner without the relevant years of experience in the legal profession.  The other bodies are open to the nominating bodies and people are normally picked by the national officers of the organisations for participation on the boards.  This provides an open field and a large number of people from which to pick and has continually strengthened people&rsquo;s participation on the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the other bodies involved.  I do not have the number of people on the NESC, but the ratio on most of the bodies is 60:40, more or less, according to the last figures I saw.  Gender is an ongoing issue, but it has generally improved a great deal across boards in the past five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the comments of his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, that we need to clean up the process by which people are appointed to public office and to end the possibility of putting friends in high places?  Does the Government plan to review the process or is this another instance of the Green Party not pursuing what it stated while in opposition?</P>
        <P>The handbook states that the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste or other party leader in the Government should be informed separately in advance of such proposals, and that the proposals should be tabled in advance.  That means there is prior knowledge.  In this context, what would be wrong with publishing a short indication of the qualifications of those being appointed?  In the United States of America, of which the Taoiseach is an admirer, significant appointments are the subject of public hearings by various committees of the Congress and Senate to ensure the persons appointed have the appropriate knowledge and expertise.  If appropriate, questions on political affiliation may be asked.  Has the Taoiseach considered reform?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to make appointments to boards before his departure on 6 May or has he discussed the issue of appointments to State boards before 7 May when there will be a change of Taoiseach and of members of the Government?  A significant appointment that is awaited is that of Comptroller and Auditor General, a position that is provided for in the Constitution.  In our system, it is an important appointment.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House whether the Cabinet has agreed an appointment or whether the Taoiseach has put forward a name, given that the Comptroller and Auditor General has indicated his intention to retire after many years of outstanding service to the State?  Has this been agreed and will this appointment be published or decided on by the Government before the Taoiseach leaves office?  The nomination is by the Government and must be approved by the D&aacute;il, after which the President makes the appointment.  This appointment is probably one of the most important of all in respect of the checks and balances and <Col N="439"/>governance arrangements that operate in this State.  While I am sure the 60 or 70 people on the various boards who were listed in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply are all good and worthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General has the power to ask very important people what they did with taxpayers&rsquo; money and to account for it.  What is the position in respect of the pending nomination and appointment, under the Constitution, of a new Comptroller and Auditor General?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton is correct to state it is an extremely important position, which is the reason it is set down in legislation and practice.  I do not believe the appointment will be made for some time to come.  While there is a process, I cannot recall exactly what it is.  Ultimately, when the process takes place, the Minister for Finance will recommend the individual to the Government, followed by Government approval and appointment by the President.  The process in respect of a replacement for Mr. Purcell has started and will take some time.  As far as I am aware, he will not resign until July and this process will be under way.  As for any other posts, the Government fills them as they arise.  However, there are no particular posts of which I am aware that will arise in the period remaining to me.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct to state that I am a supporter of many features of the American system.  However, the United States has a population of 260 million people while Ireland has a population of 4 million people.  Every position comes up for appointment there, including heads of departments, heads of committees and so on.  This constitutes a completely different system to ours, in which public servants hold all such positions.  Their ambassadors come up before committees and thankfully we do not operate such a system.  While I like many aspects of the American system, no work would ever be done around here, were we to start doing this and I do not advocate this system for the Oireachtas.  However, as I stated earlier, some of my colleagues have pilot schemes that involve committees looking at some of these issues and possibly the participation of some of the committee people in them.  However, these are issues for another day and the Ministers will bring this forward.</P>
        <P>I repeat what I have said many times before, namely, it is difficult enough in our system.  In fairness to my new colleagues in the Green Party they have, in their appointments, been leaning strongly towards some whose political allegiances are to the Deputy&rsquo;s party.  While I readily admit this is because they are good people, it demonstrates that political appointments are not made on a political basis.  Throughout the system at present, people of all political persuasions, as well as those who do not declare them, serve in positions on State boards because they are good and competent.  While obviously one finds people who are politically aligned in the system, they still are very good people and I believe the system works well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should elaborate a little in respect of the Comptroller and Auditor General because this constitutes a good example of a very important appointment.  Is this appointment, which carries highly significant remuneration, subject to advertising?  Is canvassing under way or are headhunters seeking candidates to put their names forward for the job?  It is an important appointment and constitutes one of the top ten offices in this country.  However, what happens is shrouded in mystery.  We do not even know if an appointment process is followed.  I do not see what is wrong with a person who is nominated to a board indicating his or her experience and qualifications for the position.  I cannot see why that information should not be made available at a minimum.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s party has been in Government for 11 years and Ministers will inevitably know their party&rsquo;s members and supporters.  However, if we are to encourage the best people to go forward, being a member of a political party should be neither a guarantee of appointment to a board nor a barrier to serving in a public capacity.  There should be transparency in respect <Col N="440"/>of qualifications and it should be indicated whether nominees are supporters or members of particular political parties.  If this information was openly available, perhaps more people would be willing to put their names forward for political appointments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is making a statement rather than asking a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is astonishing that we do not know the process for appointing the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>Approximately 15% of our population now comprises immigrants, yet I do not see any names which might belong to immigrants in the list supplied by the Taoiseach of appointments to boards under the remit of his Department.  How can immigrants who have lived in Ireland for the past ten or 18 years be appointed to State boards?  Should they join political parties or get involved in ICTU or the various employers&rsquo; federations?  How do people who want to serve the public partake in the appointment process?  Should it not be more transparent, inviting and open to people of skill and substance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope Deputy Burton will agree that the appointment of the current Comptroller and Auditor General was very good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I made that appointment 14 years ago and he has been in his position since then.  The same system will be followed when the new Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed.  The process has already commenced, although it will not be completed for some time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach send us a note on the process?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is actually the responsibility of the Department of Finance but I will ask that Department to send a note to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>On the other issue, that would be unfair.  I know of at least two State boards to which individuals have been appointed who everyone believes are aligned to the Deputy&rsquo;s party.  They may not be, however, and I do not think it fair to ask them.  They are very good people who have been appointed in recent weeks and months.  Normally what happens in the social partnership process is that people who have attained a high standard and reputation on the national executive of employers organisations or in senior positions in congress and have demonstrated their competence and ability to administer are appointed to boards.  They have proved they possess the skills.  Other people who have expertise in various areas are also appointed.</P>
        <P>If they were asked to appear before committees to answer for something when they are given &euro;500 or &euro;5,000 which they never claim, there is not a chance they would subject themselves to that.  They would be out of their mind to do so.  It is not the same as public office in the United States, where somebody takes a job where they will be paid several million dollars per year.  That does not happen in this country.  We do not have salaries like that for our most senior public servants.  The system is entirely different.  People come to prominence in different areas, whether through chambers of commerce, trade unions or the various sectors of the voluntary pillar.  It is a small country and it is fairly clear where people of expertise and prominence come from.  In that small pool, selection has increasingly been given over to other bodies, whether they be community, business, employer, central Government or local government bodies.  It is a very transparent system, probably more transparent than most of the European systems.  We <Col N="441"/>should not change that, as I said in reply to Deputy Kenny.  There are some pilot schemes that could be operated to allow committees to be more involved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The procedures I outlined to the House previously in regard to use of the ministerial air transport service, MATS, most recently on 6 March 2007, have not changed.  The position is that my approval is required prior to the service being used.  Procedurally, requests for use of the service are made by Ministers&rsquo; private secretaries to my office and are dealt with, in the first instance, by the staff of my office.</P>
        <P>Requests are examined by my staff with regard to the need for and purpose of travel, the destination and other logistical details.  Any necessary clarification or further information is sought at this point.  All screened requests are then submitted to me for my consideration and approval, if deemed appropriate.  Once approved, all operational matters are settled directly between the office of the Minister in question and the Department of Defence or, normally, the Air Corps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What transport is available?  Is it one jet or two?  Are the Beechcraft still available?  I was in one a few times, which was an experience.  What is the priority rating?  Are there occasions when former Taoisigh can use the transport?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We recommended it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>We will see what we can do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I was interested in the way the costings are computed.  When the late Pope John Paul II died, the Vatican requested State participation and I had the honour of travelling to attend that funeral on the Government jet with a number of others and in the presence of the Taoiseach.  I was astounded to read a few weeks later that I had cost the State &euro;11,000 to travel as a passenger on the Government jet.  How are these costs calculated?  If the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, flies to Chad, is that done according to a pecking order or can he say &ldquo;I need to get out there to see my troops and see that they are properly equipped.&rdquo;  What is the situation with regard to the would-be commander-in-chief of the Defence Forces being able to use Government transport to get out there to see how our troops are doing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government states that it will &ldquo;require carbon offsetting of all official air travel in support of urban forests&rdquo;.  This is probably the Taoiseach&rsquo;s last or second last day to take Questions.  I wondered what an urban forest was but then I read in the newspapers this morning of a proposal for the Carlton cinema site with gardens and <Col N="442"/>parks at roof level.  Is this one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s last legacies that, as part of the programme for Government, we will have an urban forest atop a 20 or 30-storey building in O&rsquo;Connell Street?  An urban forest is referred to in the programme for Government as a way of carbon offsetting and I wonder what it is.</P>

	<P>Today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> stated that a rooftop forest is included in the planning application for the new Carlton site.  Has the Taoiseach worked this out?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I will keep it simple.  Given that the Taoiseach has proven the old Irish piseog to be false that lightning never strikes twice in the one place, has he any alternative intentions of making his way to Washington?</P>

	<P>In reply to Deputy Kenny on what aircraft are available, the Gulfstream IV jet is still in operation.  That was acquired in 1991 and all of my colleagues know my views on it.  The aircraft is 16 years old and has flown more than 11,000 hours.  I am told there is not an aircraft in the world, or the Third World, that has flown that number of hours.</P>

        <P>The Learjet, which we bought at the beginning of the Presidency in 2004, was a replacement for the Beechcraft Kingair and provides a service for short and medium haul flights.

        <Quest> the progress he has made to date in 2008 in achieving the 3% annual reduction in greenhouse gases as laid out in the programme for Government; if the Government is on track to meet this target; the further initiatives planned for 2008 to meet the set target; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to my first carbon budget statement on 6 December 2007 in which I presented an overview of greenhouse gas emissions to date and how they are expected to develop over the next five years.  I related these to the programme for Government commitment of an annual average reduction of 3% in emissions, which would equate to a target of 64 million tonnes for our average emissions over the 2008-12 period. </P>
        <P>The carbon budget showed that the measures in the national climate change strategy, along with further measures announced since the Government took office, were projected to reduce annual average emissions to 65.6 million tonnes over the 2008-12 period, leaving a gap of around 1.6 million tonnes still to be bridged.</P>
        <P>I also outlined the further steps we are taking to deliver more reductions in emissions and which will take us closer to the 3% target.  The more successful we are in closing that gap, the less we will have to spend on carbon credits in order to comply with our Kyoto Protocol commitments.</P>
        <P>The 2007 carbon budget was only a first step and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be an ongoing and central feature of the work of Government across every sector.  Through the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, my ministerial colleagues and I are looking at what more can be done in the sectors for which we have responsibility.  The annual carbon budget will draw together the progress made on developing further policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>First, will the Minister give us some indication of what the reduction in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions will be in regard to policies he has introduced since he became Minister such as the light bulb, motor tax and building regulations initiatives?  What does he expect those particular measures will mean in terms of reductions in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions?  Second, if there are various reasons he cannot meet his target, will the Minister consider introducing punitive measures in various ways to force Departments other than his own to help meet the 3% target?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I made it clear in the carbon budget that what I was announcing would reduce it by approximately 600,000 tonnes.  We have a range of issues across all Departments, which is precisely the reason we put in place the committee, chaired by a member of the Opposition, on climate change.  That is a good progressive measure.  At Government level we have the energy security and climate change committee, where Ministers from all sectors are represented.</P>
        <P>I know the Deputy has further questions on this matter but it is quite clear we have a task, something I recognised on publication of the carbon budget and the awareness-raising campaign.  There is a job to be done and all the issues I have addressed, particularly regarding transport and agriculture, will be challenging, to say the least.</P><Col N="444"/>
        <P>We have made a start, however, and I emphasise that 2007 was a turning point, the year in which climate change became an issue.  It is only since then that the penny has dropped with all the political parties that this is the defining issue of our age.  It is only since then that it has gradually begun to sink in across all sectors.  We are now getting a buy-in from IBEC and industry as a whole, as well as the agriculture sector.  Everyone realises this is a challenge, allied to the other problem we are facing.  This will ensure we will meet our targets.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>With the realities of peak oil, we must make these changes in any case and reduce our carbon footprint.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree this is a very serious matter and that is the reason I wish to establish the measures the Minister intends to take to help meet the targets outlined in the programme for Government.  In the course of his initial reply, the Minister said he had challenging decisions to make to achieve those objectives.  What was the Minister thinking of and what measures will be required to meet those objectives and the programme for Government targets?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is well aware of them and I have outlined them a number of times, but I will go through them again if the Deputy so wishes.  With regard to energy, we have the renewable energy electricity tariff support scheme, which is facilitating the connection of more renewable energy to the national grid.  It will enable Ireland to meet its EU target to generate 13.2% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2010.  Ireland has set more ambitious national targets of 15% by 2010 and 33% by 2020.  There is a target of 30% co-firing of biomass and peat stations, which will reduce the emissions impact of burning peat by using carbon-neutral renewable sources.</P>
        <P>The bio-energy action plan provides the basis for Ireland to maximise the benefit of our bio-energy resources in transport, heat and electricity markets.  The energy efficiency action plan, which is being finalised by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, aims to achieve a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020, with a 33% improvement in the public sector.</P>
        <P>We have also considered the commercial bio-heat programme in the business sector, which provides grants to assist the commercial and services sector switch to wood-chip or wood pellet heating systems, replacing at least 60 million litres of heating oil per year.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland provides a range of supports for small and medium enterprises to assess their energy usage and introduce measures to enhance energy efficiency.  The Deputy is well aware that I introduced new building regulations, which will reduce energy use by 40% on current standards and a further increase in energy efficiency standards is planned for 2010.  As the Deputy knows, I will be aiming for zero emissions by 2016.</P>
        <P>In the transport sector, we are looking at technological improvements in vehicles and there is the introduction of a new VRT and motor tax system based on CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> the steps he will take to ensure that in accordance with the commitment in the <Col N="445"/>programme for Government, public water supplies are 100% compliant with drinking standards; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[14487/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure drinking water supplies are in full compliance with statutory quality standards is reflected in the &euro;4.7 billion in capital funding for water services infrastructure in the National Development Plan 2007-2013, an increase of 27% on the previous plan.  In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has, under new drinking water regulations made in June 2007, been given significantly enhanced supervisory and enforcement powers regarding quality standards in these supplies.</P>
        <P>The EPA&rsquo;s report for 2006 and 2007 on the provision and quality of drinking water in Ireland has identified 339 public water supply schemes where detailed profiling is required from source to tap to ensure consumers have a reliable supply that is consistently of a satisfactory standard.  My Department and the EPA are working in conjunction with local authorities urgently to identify, agree and implement solutions in these cases.</P>
        <P>Solutions may range from upgrading treatment facilities to abandoning unsuitable sources or improving operation and maintenance arrangements.  Where significant infrastructural works are required they will be funded by my Department and I have put in place contingency funding arrangements for that purpose.  The EPA will oversee implementation of all remedial actions as part of its enhanced supervisory function.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I bring the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the recent EPA report on the provision and quality of drinking water in Ireland for 2006 and 2007.  As the Minister will know, the report indicated that 36% of our drinking water supplies require detailed profiling to determine whether the supply must be replaced or upgraded, or where operational practices must be improved to ensure the water supply to the public is clean and wholesome.  This means a problem has been identified by the EPA with over one third of our water supply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>It published a list of 339 sites throughout Ireland which were placed on a remedial action list and 28 from 34 local authorities have problems with the water supply, with elements, such as e.coli, being found, which are unsatisfactory as far as the EPA is concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is imparting information rather than seeking it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a lack of treatment for cryptosporidium.  It is very well having so much money in the national development plan but what about now?  The EPA has indicated its standards are the minimum and they should not be left to be achieved in a few years.  They should be achieved now and it is unsatisfactory that our water supply is in such a condition.  What will the Minister do about this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>That we have such a comprehensive report is testament to the fact that we have empowered the EPA to do excellent work.  I commend the body on doing it.  We have also given the EPA not just a 43% increase in its budget but 50 extra staff.  If one looks at the newspapers, it is advertising for those staff now.</P>
        <P>I always welcome comprehensive reports, warts and all.  It is important we know the facts.  The report shows continuing underlying progress from previous years in the compliance with the required chemical standards.  For example, we know public water supplies affected by e.coli during 2006 came in at 8.3%, down from 9.7% in 2005 while private group water schemes came in at 35.8%, slightly down from 36.2% in 2005.</P><Col N="446"/>
        <P>The Deputy mentioned the 339 public water supplies identified by the EPA and her question was what we are doing about them.  Some 134 of these schemes require major capital investment and, of these, 130 are already approved for funding in the current water services investment programme.  The other four schemes are being added to the programme.  In some cases, advanced works to address some issues immediately are being considered.</P>
        <P>In the remaining 205 schemes, the safety and security of supply issues can be addressed through better operational and management procedures or relatively small-scale improvements to the treatment processes.  For example, these could include additional turbidity monitors, residual chlorine monitors and dial-out alarms, or a combination of all these.</P>
        <P>My Department and the EPA will shortly complete an action programme setting out the appropriate solutions and timescale in each of the 339 cases.  Any necessary infrastructural works will be fast-tracked and funded by my Department through a contingency funding arrangement within the water services and rural water programmes, as appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is welcome that the Minister is providing more staff to the EPA but the problem is with local authorities.  The EPA found that 14 local authorities were not doing their duty in terms of monitoring water supplies.  They do not have enough staff or expertise for that.  When he was Minister, Deputy Dick Roche told the then mayor of Galway, Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, that money was available but he did not provide the necessary resources or staffing to the local authority to solve the problem.</P>
        <P>The EPA discovered that the equipment at 40% of treatment plants is inadequate in the context of allowing them to treat supplies for cryptosporidium, which gave rise to the problem in Galway.  Cryptosporidium can cause acute short-term infections or illnesses in children that are untreatable.  The public is, therefore, at risk.  The position in respect of e.coli is similar.  A recent study indicated that it costs this country &euro;135 million to treat people with stomach bugs, which are mainly caused by e.coli infections.  The EPA also uncovered major difficulties as regards the treatment of e.coli in our water supplies.</P>
        <P>It is not enough to state that sufficient money will be available over a period of years.  Funding must be provided for specific projects and local authorities should be given the necessary staff, expertise and resources to allow them to deal with the problems to which I refer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy referred to the specific example of Galway city.  I had the opportunity to visit the new Terryland plant recently and I spoke to the engineers there who confirmed that not only will the quality of drinking water in Galway be good as a result of the initiatives my Department has taken, it will probably be the best quality of drinking water in the country.  Moving from a position where supplies were infected with cryptosporidium to one where drinking water quality will be extremely good represents a major change.</P>
        <P>The 339 schemes identified by the EPA include those where there is likely to be a risk of infection by cryptosporidium.  Upgrading measures will provide safeguards against such infection.  A cryptosporidium working group has been established under the aegis of the EPA to address issues such as the main contributory factors to high-risk supplies, the development of source protection guidelines, updated advice on risk assessment and corrective actions that can be taken to reduce risk.  A number of guideline documents have been produced and are available to local authorities.</P>

        <Quest> the number of local authority housing starts for 2006, 2007 and to date in 2008; his projections of local authority housing starts for the rest of 2008 and for 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 reflect the strong commitment to expand social housing provision contained in the social partnership agreement Towards 2016.  Under the social partnership agreement, local authorities are to deliver 21,000 social housing starts over the period 2007-09.</P>
        <P>Good progress was made towards achieving this target with approximately 6,850 homes commenced, purchased or acquired under long-term lease in 2007.  This is a 12% increase on the figure of 6,161 housing starts achieved in 2006.  Full details on the output figures for social and affordable housing for 2007 will be published shortly in my Department&rsquo;s annual housing statistics bulletin.  Data for the first quarter of 2008 are not yet available.</P>
        <P>The Exchequer provision for social housing for 2008 and 2009 is expected to allow for a further 14,000 starts in this period.  Housing allocations will be announced in the near future for all housing authorities and a better picture of the number of starts likely in 2008 will be available when authorities receive their allocations and are able to finalise their work programme for the year.</P>
        <P>Taking all Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources into account, the total provision this year for social housing will be almost &euro;2.5 billion.  This represents an increase of 16% on the 2007 figure.  These resources will ensure that further substantial progress will be made towards achievement of the target of meeting the needs of some 60,000 households over the period of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 through the range of social housing measures in place, including direct local authority provision, the use of Part V agreements, voluntary and co-operative housing and units provided under the rental accommodation scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State outlined a very rosy picture as regards matters relating to housing, particularly when he is aware that many local authorities will not engage in any new housing starts during the current year and will merely be asked to complete those that are already under construction.  There will not be any new initiatives.  My local authority was directed by the Department to commence two schemes in 2007 but it has now been told not to do so.  If these schemes had proceeded, a further 32 houses would have been built in the two communities to which they relate.  Cutbacks are taking place.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State accept responsibility for the fact that Dublin City Council will this week close down its affordable housing list?  Last year, only 260 affordable houses were provided and the number of houses built has plummeted from a figure of 722 in 2005.  Will the Minister of State acknowledge that there has been a major reduction in the number of housing starts in the public sector this year?  Is he contemplating introducing any new initiatives to assist first-time buyers who are particularly interested in getting their feet on the property ladder?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not envisage that there will be any cutbacks.  If one considers the allocation for this year, while we are investing &euro;1.7 billion, an increase of 16% on the 2006 figure, the HFA and other agencies will also invest &euro;800 million.  As a result, the total spend in the social housing market will be &euro;2.5 billion.</P>
        <P>On our achievements to date, in 2006 the total figure for house completions was 93,000.  Of these, some 6,361 were in the social housing sector.  In 2007, even though the market was constrained to some degree, there were still 7,400 completions.  In the area of affordable hous<Col N="448"/>ing, the number of completions was 3,600.  We believe we attained our target of 9,000 social housing completions at the end of 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should be aware that a commitment was given in 2016 that 60,000 new houses would be built between 2007 and 2009.  The Government does not have a hope of fulfilling that commitment on the basis of what he has just stated.  Does the Minister of State agree that the number of housing starts for 2008 has been dramatically reduced and that the rental subsidy scheme is a shambles?  Responsibility for the latter was supposed to be transferred from the health authorities to the local authorities but in many areas this cannot be done because the necessary administrative systems are not in place.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State indicate that action that will be taken to deal with the problem of the numbers on housing lists increasing?  The Department&rsquo;s programmes are not working.  Will the Minister of State say if he has new initiatives to take, particularly in respect of affordable housing schemes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is expected that we will have resources available for the remainder of 2008 and for 2009 which will allow us to achieve the substantial target of 18,000 social housing starts.  Having met our target in 2007, we have every reason to be confident that we can do so for the 2008 and 2009.</P>
        <P>The Deputy inquired about affordable housing.  I intend to have discussions with the Dublin city manager regarding applications for affordable housing, the number of people applying for such housing and the level of information required from applicants.  It appears that some of those applying for affordable housing may not have the resources or capacity to meet their mortgage payments.  I want to examine with the Dublin city manager the possibility of restructuring application forms in order to ensure additional information will be provided by applicants indicating, quite clearly, their capacity to meet the requirements of the affordable housing scheme.</P>
        <P>I am considering introducing two new schemes.  The first of these, which relates to affordable housing, is a new shared equity scheme to replace the current shared ownership scheme, which has not been operating successfully and which has gone downhill in recent years.  This new scheme will provide people with an opportunity to enter home ownership and to realise the ambitions of many lower paid workers.  I want to give local authority and social housing tenants a new opportunity by means of the incremental purchase scheme I intend to introduce.  This will allow them to purchase as little as 30% of their homes in the future.  The schemes to which I refer will be announced in due course.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the recent statement by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in which she addressed potential opportunities for Ireland&rsquo;s agricultural sector and the various ways in which the sector is reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  She pointed out, for example, that farmers are now using less fertilisers and more efficiently, which cuts nitrous oxide emissions.  She also noted that improved efficiencies in animal breeding, <Col N="449"/>which have been researched and supported by Teagasc, have resulted in fewer emissions per unit of production. </P>
        <P>Naturally, in a business as usual scenario, emissions from the agriculture sector would rise rather than fall, but that is also true of other sectors of the economy.  However, the Government&rsquo;s approach to climate change recognises that it can no longer be a business as usual approach and that we must now focus on making the transition to a lower carbon economy.  Every sector will play its part in that transition and every sector, including agriculture, will face opportunities as well as challenges.  In this regard, I particularly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to look for new and innovative abatement options in the agriculture sector and to promote new farming practices and methods that can reduce emissions as they become available.</P>
        <P>In addressing the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture sector, it is important not to overlook the significant threat which climate change poses for its viability, not least to drought and the need for irrigation.  It is essential that both these factors are incorporated into a fundamental analysis of agriculture, forestry and land use.  Policies to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations and the effects of climate change will open new opportunities as well as helping to address the threats which climate change presents for Irish agriculture.  Through the Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security, I am working on an ongoing basis with my ministerial colleagues to ensure the long-term sustainability of all sectors of the economy, including agriculture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the course of his discussions with the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, the Minister said he envisaged low impact agriculture as part of the contribution towards reducing carbon emissions.  Perhaps the Minister can explain what he means by low impact agriculture because the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food certainly does not know about it.  </P>

	<P>That is under the belt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of her contribution to the committee, she indicated that she is exploring a number of options but she has not been specific.  Following his discussions about these matters with the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, will the Minister indicate what specific proposals we can expect from the agricultural sector to help reduce carbon emissions in 2008 and 2009?  At this stage, I am sure the Minister has a number of specific proposals that his ministerial colleague, Deputy Coughlan, has discussed with him.  Do they include no-till agriculture, special dietary requirements for animals or tapping into methane gases from farms?  What measures can we expect to see being implemented in the agricultural sector?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>CAP reform will reduce emissions by 2.4 million tonnes per annum.  About 2 million tonnes of emissions will be removed annually from the atmosphere by Irish forests.  These are significant reductions.  From his work on the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, the Deputy will be aware that the Environmental Protection Agency has also done significant work in this regard.  I understand that the committee was addressed by Dr. Murphy from UCC on the way in which soilage could be used to create bio-energy.  These are significant developments but they are still in their infancy.  We need to address the potential for second-generation biofuels.  Clearly, we have experienced difficulties with the first generation of biofuels but we can go beyond that.</P>
        <P>There are constant technological advances.  I recall that many years ago, when I was Lord Mayor of Dublin, I had a car that ran on biofuel, which was the butt of many jokes at the time.  Since then, of course, the situation has changed.  Given the pioneering work undertaken by <Col N="450"/>Bernard Rice in Teagasc, one can see the sort of change that can be achieved by an individual.  If everyone now concentrates on this sector, we can make a significant impact on agriculture.  We are talking about major emissions from the agriculture sector of over 28%, but I am confident that with the sort of innovative changes we are examining we can reduce that figure significantly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport and agriculture have been highlighted as the major contributors to carbon emissions.  Obviously, the Minister&rsquo;s discussions with his counterpart in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have yielded little in terms of what is required to meet our targets in the agricultural sector.  Is the Minister getting full co-operation from his Cabinet colleagues in order to meet his commitments, particularly from the Minister, Deputy Coughlan?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  As I said in my opening remarks, there is a recognition now among all parties and members of parties, including Ministers, that this is the defining issue and challenge of our age.  Therefore, everyone must step up to the plate.  Everyone knows there is an obligation so everyone must bring something to the party.  We will all have to contribute.  There is an acknowledgement that something serious must be done. </P>

	<P>The beef is in the many herds of cattle, as the Deputy knows.  I have recognised the difficulty, which is that we now have growing markets.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food may herself have referred to this when she addressed the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  There are huge increases in population around the world, along with unprecedented economic growth in countries such as China and India.  There is a new affluence in such places and they are looking for more animal protein.  The potential is there to expand the national herd and increase emissions as a result, but that will not keep us in compliance with our Kyoto commitments.  There is a recognition of the reality and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is keenly aware of her environmental responsibilities.</P>

        <Quest> if the Government&rsquo;s light bulb initiative will help Ireland meet the 3% annual reduction target while taking into account that the ESB is part of the emissions trading sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I was pleased with the constructive first meeting I had with the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  As I said in my statement then, the committee is a welcome addition to our national parliamentary structure, which clearly reflects the importance the Oireachtas attaches to the climate change agenda.  I look forward to further engagements with the committee on national, EU and wider international aspects of that agenda.</P>
        <P>Progress towards achieving the Government&rsquo;s domestic 3% average annual reduction commitment may be measured with reference to net national greenhouse gas emissions.  While this includes emissions from installations in the EU emissions trading scheme, the control of emissions within that scheme is primarily a matter for the scheme participants.</P><Col N="451"/>
        <P>The trading scheme allows participating installations to emit in excess of their allocation provided they purchase additional allowances in respect of any excess emissions.  Alternatively, an installation may choose to reduce its emissions to the level of its allocated allowances.  In this regard, the scheme provides the flexibility for installations to meet their obligations in the most cost-effective manner available to them.</P>
        <P>Each installation&rsquo;s emissions are recorded by the EPA for the purpose of compiling an annual national emissions inventory.  Any emissions above the total annual allocation to the emissions trading scheme must be covered through trading arrangements by the installations concerned and will not therefore be counted in assessing Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
        <P>On the light bulbs issue, savings in electricity consumption from more energy efficient lighting will reduce national emissions from electricity generation.  As all electricity generation plants in Ireland are included in the emissions trading scheme and have their emissions capped for the 2008-12 period in advance, this reduction will not lead to any further reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s national distance to target for Kyoto Protocol compliance.  However, the emissions savings will count towards the Government&rsquo;s domestic 3% average annual reduction commitment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have clarified that.  One must distinguish between commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and our domestic commitments in the programme for Government.  The latter includes a 3% annual reduction.  This measure is counted as part of that but not as part of our Kyoto Protocol commitments.  That is crystal clear.  Deputy Hogan was there on the day I addressed that committee.</P>

	<P>Deputies Hogan and Tuffy will be glad to know that we are on target in respect of the light bulb initiative.  We have consulted with various sectors and a consensus is emerging on the best way forward.  I attended an exhibition at the weekend.  There were various energy efficient light bulbs in all makes and sizes and this will contribute to our 3% annual reduction.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security Meeting of 28 February 2008; if emissions trading sector organisations will have no role in the 3% reduction target; if other sectors will have to decrease their emissions beyond 3% to meet Government targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[14324/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 76 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper.</P>
        <P>I was very pleased with the constructive first meeting which I had with the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  The committee is a welcome addition to our national parliamentary structure, one which clearly reflects the importance the Oireachtas attaches to the climate change agenda.  I look forward to further engagements with the committee on national, EU and wider international aspects of that agenda.</P>
        <P>Progress towards achieving the Government&rsquo;s domestic 3% average annual reduction commitment may be measured with reference to net national greenhouse gas emissions.  While this includes emissions from installations in the EU emissions trading scheme, the control of emissions within that scheme is primarily a matter for the scheme participants.  The trading scheme allows participating installations to emit in excess of their allocation provided they purchase additional allowances in respect of any excess emissions.  Alternatively, an installation may choose to reduce its emissions to the level of its allocated allowances.  In this regard, the scheme provides the flexibility for installations to meet their obligations in the most cost-effective manner available to them.</P>
        <P>I do not want to continue further because it is a repeat of what I said earlier.  It is a cut and paste job so rather than wasting the Deputy&rsquo;s time I will allow him to ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it a cut and paste job from the time of Deputy Dick Roche or from the Minister&rsquo;s time in office?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We were a little confused by the Minister&rsquo;s previous comments on whether the emissions trading sector was included in the 3% target.  The Minister has been very frank in stating that it is part of the 3% reduction.  That makes a significant difference from the calculations and statements made by the Minister and to the genuineness of his commitment on this matter.  We will revert to the matter.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister engage with industry in the near future in a more co-operative way in terms of the big companies included in the emissions trading sector in order to make a meaningful contribution to meeting the Government target?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We have already engaged with industry.  There was an energy forum in the Shelbourne Hotel, which was very well attended.  It was packed out.  That shows the level of engagement that is there.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="453"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>They could be frightened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>They were far from frightened when they examined the financial incentives that exist.  The Taoiseach said to me on the day that they may not be interested in the environment but they were interested in the tax incentives.  They were there in droves.  I do not care what is motivating people as long as they make a contribution to cutting our greenhouse gas emissions.  We will use every opportunity to engage fully with those who are part of the emissions trading scheme and those outside it so that in both sectors we can make a meaningful contribution.</P>
        <P>I will be doing part two of the awareness raising campaign on Sunday.  The advertisements have already begun and are viewed as a success.  We will go beyond that with the new carbon calculator that I will introduce on Sunday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister not think the 3% target is a con job on people?  He set out in his carbon budget that the bulk of our reductions would be achieved by the purchase of carbon credits.  We will buy pieces of paper to achieve our carbon reductions.  The rest was achieved by forests that already exist.  That is what the Minister set out for 2008-12 in his carbon report the day after the budget.  The Minister is talking the talk but, in reality, there will be no significant reductions in emissions.  If there were, the Minister would establish good public transport as fast as possible.  It is all cosmetic but the Minister will have done nothing to reduce carbon emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We will comply fully with our Kyoto Protocol commitments in the period 2008-12.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>By buying carbon credits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We will go beyond that.  The Deputy knows that money was set aside.  There is no indication that the &euro;270 million will be used.  I am confident we can do so domestically.  The Marrakesh Declaration puts an onus on all states to reduce emissions domestically and not to rely on carbon credits.  It is an obvious point to make but the Deputy is right in stating that if we are to make decreases we must get away from car dependency and invest in public transport significantly.  Many of these changes will be brought about in any event because the price of oil is increasing all the time.  The Government and the Opposition parties are in this together.  This will affect all parties and individuals, whether in Government or in Opposition; these two issues will affect the country in a deep and dramatic way.</P>

        <Quest> if, in view of the recent public opinion poll commissioned by his Department to analyse the potential reception of carbon taxes, he is actively pursuing the introduction of carbon taxes with the Minister for Finance; the other measures his Department is taking to pursue the introduction of carbon taxes; the full cost of the opinion poll commissioned by his Department paid to the market research company; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of taxation policy, the programme for Government committed to establish a new Commission on Taxation.  The commission, which was established on 14 February 2008, is tasked in its terms of reference to look at the introduction of measures to further lower carbon emissions and to phase in, on a revenue neutral basis, appropriate fiscal measures including a carbon levy over the lifetime of the Government.  In its work, the <Col N="454"/>commission is required to have regard to the commitments on economic competitiveness and on taxation contained in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The commission has invited my Department to make a submission to assist in its deliberations.  I welcome that invitation and my Department will respond within the deadline set by the commission.  I believe that the correct course of action is now to develop the carbon levy commitment in the programme for Government through the commission and I will not be pursuing any alternative approaches while the deliberations of the commission are in progress.</P>
        <P>The public opinion poll was carried out by the market research company Behaviour and Attitudes as part of the current climate change awareness campaign at a cost of &euro;20,580 exclusive of value added tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister states he took the correct approach in this matter.  Why was an opinion poll necessary in the first place?  Was it insisted on by the major party in Government?  Could the Minister not go ahead otherwise?  The Minister did not indicate if he intended to introduce carbon taxes.  What type of behaviour was identified by spending &euro;20,580?  What was the manner and process by which the poll was commissioned and carried out?</P>

       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the company carried out the poll.  There was no need to consult other members of Government.  I am the Minister responsible.  We set out to have an awareness raising campaign and, in order to raise awareness one must measure how quickly and by how much one can raise awareness.  A baseline study is needed to find out where we are now.  The poll findings were interesting and show that, in principle, 81% of people favoured the introduction of a carbon levy.  It was a comprehensive questionnaire, conducted face to face.  I gave the details of the poll in my speech in the Mansion House at a seminar organised by the EPA, which was attended by approximately 900 people.  They showed that once one got beyond the principle of a carbon levy, when one got into specific items such as increasing the price of petrol by eight cent or whatever, there were slight problems and there was less enthusiasm.  When we went into it in further detail we discovered that 50% of people still wanted to see action on the carbon levy.  However, one could say there is a 50% element of resistance there as well. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very curious about that survey and I wrote to the Minister&rsquo;s Department a couple of weeks ago for a copy to see what questions were asked, the findings and so on.  I find it difficult to believe that 81% of people are in favour of carbon taxes. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Some 81% of the Government is in favour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>There were recent news reports about rising food costs and that people are struggling with increased petrol costs and so on.  Why should people want to pay more for their petrol or gas?  I find this incredible.  I notice the report stated that people were in favour of tough measures, such as carbon taxes.  These are basically tough measures affecting individuals, which will add to inflation and so on.  What about tough measures for the Government, such as better public transport?  The Government should be faced with tough measures. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and understand they have a duty, as we all do, to tackle the biggest issue facing humanity.  People want responsible action.  I can check how many members of the Labour Party, perhaps, or what percentage of its supporters are in favour of these measures.  I suspect it is more than the Deputy believes.  Too often politicians run for cover when they hear of a carbon levy.  If the Deputy talks it up in the way she is doing, she is not doing anyone a service.  She is scaring people off.  I come back to Deputy McCormack in this regard, there is a definite commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a carbon levy.  I sincerely hope members of the Opposition will be as enthusiastic about the introduction of a carbon levy as I am. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are aware of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to a carbon levy.  He said during the publication of his carbon budget that he would expect it to be introduced in 2009.  What progress has been made and will there be an interim report from the Commission on Taxation before the next budget that will draw on that matter?  When will the Minister put a price on carbon, as he promised?  Were any other surveys carried out by his Department which were not published and of which we should be aware? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the only one I know about so far, but I shall check it out for the Deputy. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We shall see whether there are any further surveys.  All politicians are interested in surveys to see how the people are thinking, but it is encouraging.  The fact that the Green Party&rsquo;s poll ratings are going in the right direction is further evidence that people are interested in acting responsibly in tackling this very important issue.  As regards the carbon levy and the deliberations of the Commission on Taxation, I do not know whether it will publish an interim report.  I certainly hope it does.  It has been tasked with the introduction of a carbon levy and asked to make this a priority, and I hope that happens.  I am due to meet Professor Frank Convery in May.   He is a member of the commission and I shall ask him in detail what progress has been made.  From everyone&rsquo;s viewpoint I hope the carbon levy will be introduced. </P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the many thousands of people who are living in sub-standard accommodation paid for by rent supplement; the date on which the new standards for rented accommodation will be completed; and if he has plans to ensure that these measures will be fast-tracked into law to provide effective safeguards for those who are already in serious need of adequate housing. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 116 together. </P><Col N="456"/>
        <P>While responsibility for enforcement of the private rented accommodation standards, as prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993, rests with the relevant local authority, I am committed to ensuring that a robust framework is in place to promote improved standards in this part of the residential sector.  The significantly increased resources I am providing to support inspections by local authorities is one example of my commitment to addressing issues of sub-standard private rented accommodation and is translating into significantly increased enforcement activity on the ground.  I have also taken a number of opportunities, when meeting local authorities, to emphasise the high priority that must be assigned to effective action in this area.</P>
        <P>The revision of the standards regulations is an important element of An Action Programme to Promote Improvement in Standards, which was launched on foot of the Towards 2016 agreement.  A general review of the regulations has been carried out, in consultation with relevant interests, and account has been taken of relevant recommendations in two reports recently published by the Centre for Housing Research on measures to promote improvement in private rented accommodation standards.</P>
        <P>I am establishing a small working group comprising local authority and sectoral representatives to input into the final drafting of the revised regulations.  Following a short further period of consultation, I intend to finalise the new regulations in July.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  This is a major issue, with 60,000 families in receipt of rent supplement.  The vast majority of accommodation, particularly in Dublin, fails to meet the minimum legal standard, basically as regards water standards, heating and ventilation.  There is mould growing on some walls and ceilings and only recently &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast a major special programme on just how bad conditions are. </P>
        <P>According to the State-funded report published by the Centre for Housing Research, sub-standard accommodation is most prevalent in this rented sector.  Basically, 78% of all private rented accommodation in Dublin failed the standard test, 49% in Clare and 56% in Louth.  When will the Minister of State get real on this issue?  I welcome the fact that he has issued a memo and that there is to be a working group.  However, can we now have some action and impose heavy penalties on the landlords responsible for these properties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The issues brought to light by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme were of great concern to all of us.  However, it must be remembered that the issues the programme raised were on the basis of rent supplement, which is the remit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and is operated by community welfare officers.  Before the programme was broadcast I was very aware of people going into the rented accommodation scheme.  We built in the region of 700,000 units in the past ten years and 100,000 were taken up by the rented sector.  Therefore the standards under rented accommodation are excellent and obviously we are encouraging more and more.  We want to take 32,000 people off the rent supplement and put them into rent accommodation by 2009, and we are progressing in that direction. </P>
        <P>In relation to community welfare officers and rent supplement, I am concerned that people are engaged in a desktop activity in this regard.  I met the director of community care six weeks ago and told him I was not happy with the standard of accommodation.  I asked that there should be further discussions between the HSE and the Department on setting protocols which would review matters on the ground.  If, for instance, a local authority examines a property with a view to bringing someone into rented accommodation after 18 months and if it is not up to scratch, this should be reported to the community welfare office.  In the event, the com<Col N="457"/>munity welfare office will then identify the property concerned as not being suitable for rent supplement purposes.  We are making progress in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Given today&rsquo;s launch of the Green Paper on Local Government, one hopes the primary outcome of local government reform will be an improvement of standards at local level.  If we consider the Minister of State&rsquo;s track record in this regard, we will realise it has been an abysmal failure.  Is he aware that only one inspection took place in his own area of Cork, where over 9,000 houses were registered in 2006?  Is this acceptable in his own bailiwick in Cork?  In Cork city in my constituency, where approximately 6,000 houses were registered in 2006, 780 houses were inspected, half of which failed.  The houses that failed, which were featured on a &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, were not inspected at a later date.</P>
        <P>When I raised this matter on 23 February prior to the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, the Minister gave a completely disingenuous answer in the House to the effect that inspection rates had actually increased.  They have not.  What the Minister of State did was focus on the narrow context of inspection rate increases from one year to another.  However, the registration rate in the two years in question grew several-fold and the inspection rate collapsed to 7%.  It is therefore a nonsense for the Minister of State to claim in this Chamber that the inspection rates are 33% and 44% when in fact they have collapsed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact of the matter is that, in 2004, there were 25,000 registrations.  Since the setting up of the PRTB, 210,000 registrations took place.  Figures for 2007 will show a 40% increase and that there has been an increase from 13,000 to almost 14,000.</P>
        <P>On the houses that are not up to standard, I refer the Deputy to a report issued by the Centre for Housing Research last year.  Of all the rented accommodation that was inspected, 1% was not up to standard.</P>

	<P>Does the Minister of State agree that the scheme is subsidising private landlords?  As such, the State should insist on the best possible standards.  Some 48,000 families are in homes that are not of the highest standard, yet the State is paying for the scheme.  What action will the Minister of State take to prosecute landlords for ripping the State off, as is happening?  What extra inspections will be carried out to ensure that the landlords of sub-standard dwellings will no longer be allowed to receive State subsidies?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the Department&rsquo;s figures from 2004 to 2006.  They show clearly that the number of registered dwellings increased from 22,000 in 2004 to 132,000 in 2006.  The inspection rate to which the Minister of State is referring does not add up.  Figures show that the inspection rate has dropped from 32% to 7.4%.  For every house registered, the Exchequer receives &euro;50 from the PRTB.  Given that there is a revenue stream from the PRTB, it is not the Department that is ring-fencing the fund.  The Minister of State should not therefore brag that he is providing money to allow for inspections because the money is actually coming from landlords themselves who want their properties inspected.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact is that if one refers to PRTB registrations alone, one will find that they increased by 44% between 2005 and 2006, and by 40% between 2006 and 2007.  I have ensured that local authorities that carry out inspections are being rewarded.  Those that are not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, bearing in mind that Deputy Bertie Ahern will not be Taoiseach for much longer, I raised with the T&aacute;naiste the case of a 76 year old patient with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease who was on a trolley in the Mater Hospital for four days.  The T&aacute;naiste dismissed my point as being facile and simplistic.  I find this extraordinary if it is the new philosophy in Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is neither facile nor simplistic and the circumstances described are experienced by hundreds of patients in accident and emergency units every day.</P>
        <P>I make no apology for bringing to Members&rsquo; attention a case brought to the attention of Deputy James Reilly.  Relevant lines of a letter sent by the mother of a 13 year old read:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Our 13 year old daughter suffers from depression and anxiety and last week took an overdose for the second time.  We met with the medical team and they explained to us that she was at high risk of harming herself and needed to be hospitalised.  They explained that she needed to be admitted to Warrenstown or St. John of God&rsquo;s.  I cried but the worst was yet to come when they told us that we would have to wait four to six weeks for a bed.  Today her mood is the lowest I have experienced yet.  She needs to be hospitalised but there is still no bed available in Warrenstown or St. John of God&rsquo;s</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is neither facile nor simplistic.  The family, one of hundreds, must live with those circumstances every minute of every day.  Does the Taoiseach not feel a sense of guilt that, in spite of expenditure of &euro;15 billion on the health system, a depressed 13 year old young girl with the potential to self-harm cannot be given a bed in a hospital for the next four to six weeks?  We remember other tragic cases of people who had to wait for treatment and who are unfortunately no longer with us.  How can a young girl so desperately in need of attention be left in circumstances on foot of which her distraught parents must refer her case to the Minister for Health and Children and Deputy James Reilly?</P>
        <P>Is this not symptomatic of the circumstances in which the HSE is faced with a deficit of &euro;300 million and in which the Minister for Health and Children is clearly and patently unable to deal with the crisis that is now spreading through the veins of the health system like wildfire?  Is this not symptomatic of all the cutbacks that leave a 13 year old defenceless in circumstances in which the State is unable to come to her assistance?  Can the Taoiseach indicate whether further cutbacks are coming down the line under the watch of the Minister for Health and Children through this monstrosity that has been created in the HSE?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of questions were raised by Deputy Kenny.  On the case of Mrs. Margaret McEntee, which I think is the case to which he referred, I was very concerned by reports regarding the time which this lady spent in the accident and emergency unit of the Mater Hospital.  The HSE advised that the patient presented to the hospital on 14 April and was admitted on 17 April.  As I have said previously here that is outside of its own figures &mdash; even the figures it presents to us.  Clearly it is an unacceptable situation.  The hospital&rsquo;s patient liaison officer was in contact with the lady&rsquo;s family during the time and the hospital has conveyed its regret for the time she spent awaiting admission.  That has not been the norm these past few years in the hospitals.  They report through the health committee monthly on the totality of the position and that was way outside of its own guidelines and benchmarks on <Col N="461"/>which it is improving all the time.  The hospital is working closely with the HSE in seeking to manage and improve the flow of patients through the hospital and the accident and emergency department.  The focus is on improving the internal processes where possible and on the provision of appropriate community support services.  From the Minister&rsquo;s and the Government&rsquo;s perspective, improving the delivery of accident and emergency services will continue to be our top priority.  </P>
        <P>The daily average number of patients awaiting admissions in the month just gone was 107, compared with 105 a year a go, which is practically the same.  The average daily figure for April to date is higher than the reported average for the same period of last year.  There are many reasons for that.  The colder weather has continued.  Deputies will recall that April last year was a far warmer period and this affects the figures.  If one looks at the figures, there is a huge difference between what they were in the first half of April last year and the first half this year.  However, the HSE has put in place a framework to collect and deal with these issues and try to improve them.  It has also taken on additional beds to try to improve the delayed discharges.  I think it has 200 more beds than it had.  It states in the figures it presented to us that there are far more delayed discharges than there were last year.</P>
        <P>I should also mention the phased opening of St. Mary&rsquo;s.  There are 100 beds which are opening at a rate of ten per week.  That was scheduled to commence at the end of March.  This timeline has been adjusted to take account of staff recruitment.  It will start next week on 1 May.  Some 70 beds in Cherry Orchard have also opened and 24 beds will open when the staff have been recruited, which is ongoing.  These beds will be used mainly for older people who have completed the acute phase of their treatment and are at present in the hospitals.  Some months ago I said I would keep the House updated on those figures.  Those beds are now in the process of opening.  Between the three of them there will be 170 beds in addition to the 200 that have been provided.</P>
        <P>Obviously I do not have details on each individual case.  However, I can tell Deputy Kenny that regarding the consultants&rsquo; contract that has just been completed, 15 of those consultants&rsquo; contracts are for those consultants who are involved in child adolescent services.  This is a substantial number of consultants.  There are also extra beds in St. Vincent&rsquo;s in Fairview, in St. Stephen&rsquo;s in Cork and in Galway.  Obviously those consultant posts are now in the process of being advertised as part of the agreement with the consultants.  Those posts will bring with them the additional beds in St. Anne&rsquo;s in Galway, St. Vincent&rsquo;s in Fairview and in St. Stephen&rsquo;s in Cork.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I give the Taoiseach credit for his more caring response than that of the T&aacute;naiste who said that to raise an individual case here was facile and simplistic.  The case of the 13 year old I have raised with the Taoiseach is in the possession of the Minister for Health and Children and nothing has happened.  This is the case of a 13 year old depressed and anxious girl, who has been medically assessed as potentially committing self-harm.  She has now been told she will need to wait for four to six weeks for a bed in Warrenstown House or St. John of Gods.  The Minister for Health and Children should not hide behind the Health Service Executive and attempt to get away with this.  Health is not just about economics and statistics.  Politics is always about people.  I will make no apology for continuing to raise individual serious cases in this House, the forum of the people.</P>

	<P>The Minister is continually hiding behind the Health Service Executive and has failed to do her duty.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach mentioned extra beds.  Perhaps he could take this matter to the Minister for Health and Children.  We are now faced with the closure of a medical ward in James Connolly Memorial Hospital for a full month in the summer; the closure of a surgical ward in the same hospital for a full month in the summer; the cancellation of all outpatient clinics for two full weeks in summer and December in James Connolly Memorial Hospital; the halving of beds in two wards in Tallaght from 60 to 30 from next week; the cancellation from June of &ldquo;hospital in the home&rdquo; which allows patients to be discharged home early; reduced services in Monaghan and Dundalk without any extra resources being put into Cavan or Drogheda; respite services being cut; and cancer services being cut in Sligo and in Mayo without being replaced.  There is a consistent pattern here with hundreds of patients from all over the country now streaming into Deputies&rsquo; clinics because they cannot get medicines from 1 May.  Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies are saying this is a matter for the HSE.  As outlined by Deputies Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan and James Reilly at the Joint Committee on Health and Children, the Minister for Health and Children instructed the HSE to get on with it.</P>
        <P>All of these cuts indicate either that the Taoiseach does not know or that the T&aacute;naiste and incoming Taoiseach does not care.  In the final hours left to him in the powerful position as Taoiseach, will he take aside the Minister for Health and Children, who has been a loyal servant to him over the years, and ask her to direct the Health Service Executive, as is within her authority, to produce a plan to reject front-line cuts in services for thousands of patients across the country?  If he does that before he leaves office he will at least have done some good given that we have a health crisis being presided over by the Minister for Health and Children who will not accept any responsibility for it but passes the buck continually to the Health Service Executive.</P>

	<P>We have continued working with the trade unions to deal with the issue of last September&rsquo;s embargo and we have delivered increased capital expenditure into several developments in those hospitals and will continue to do that.  Like every organisation the HSE has to live within the budget agreed in its own plan.  It has to manage that throughout the year.  Last year there was criticism in the House when it only started doing that in the last quarter.  If it is doing it over a longer period of a year, that is the correct thing to do.</P>
        <P>There are 130,000 people working full-time or part-time in our public health service.  The Government&rsquo;s ongoing investment in the health service has increased every year that I have been here.  We have increased the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health-care professionals employed in the public health service.  We have invested heavily in the education of front-line staff in personnel to ensure a sufficient supply graduates.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are continuing to do that.  They are in several locations around the country.  There is &euro;200 million on the capital programme for this year which has been allocated.  We have increased the number of beds.  I was answering about the difficulties in the delayed discharges.  The reality is we have recently provided 200 contracted beds in private nursing homes, 180 of which were in Dublin.  They have now been filled.  We are far from cutting back on this issue.  We have seen the phased opening of facilities at St. Mary&rsquo;s and Cherry Orchard Hospital and, between them, they will provide 170 beds.  These facilities require staff and additional resources.  Given the significant number of beds planned for this year and the associated recruitment involved, every unit will require additional staff.  While the HSE must manage its budget, this will not stop the extension and development of services in new locations.  The House should take account of this aspect.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach shocked that, as he leaves office, consumer inflation is at 5%, bearing in mind that when he came into office in 1997 he inherited an inflation rate from the outgoing Government of 1.5%?  Does the Taoiseach agree that this rate of inflation is dangerous, damaging and disappointing for our economy and country, particularly as economic growth is now faltering in a range of areas?  The Government made a fuss in recent years about the abolition of the groceries order but only the price of drink seems to have fallen in the meantime, with negative consequences for society.</P>
        <P>In his time the Taoiseach has visited many supermarkets, if not to shop then to canvass, and I am sure he is aware that the vast majority of people who shop for families and push the supermarket trolley are women.  They are angry at the exploitation of consumers and the fact that the Government is doing nothing to protect ordinary families from the price increases that are currently being experienced.</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the rip-off, profiteering and exploitation being experienced by Irish consumers, particularly at the hands of British-based multiples converting sterling prices to euros?  The mark up when prices are converted from sterling to euros can frequently be as high as 50% or 60%.  Many surveys have been done in this regard recently and one in the <i>Irish <Col N="464"/>Daily Mail</i> found that Gillette Mach Turbo razor blades, which the Taoiseach may use, sold for &pound;11.99, which should be &euro;15.17, but sold in Boots for &euro;19.49.  The price difference in this case is almost 30% greater than the exchange rate difference between sterling and euro.  Furniture is more expensive and a wardrobe that might cost &pound;1,500 will cost up to &euro;2,500.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach have any proposals to ensure the Competition Authority or the National Consumer Agency do anything about this blatant exploitation of Irish shoppers and consumers?  We should bear in mind that this is occurring at a time when some people in the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, and the Construction Industry Federation are suggesting that workers, particularly those in the construction industry, should take pay cuts.  Does the Government propose to do anything about this scandal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s first point, I do remember what the rate of inflation was when I took office.  I also remember that unemployment was at 11%, single people paid tax on &euro;72 per week, there was no minimum wage, old people received very low rates of welfare and the preceding Government gave them an increase of &pound;1.50, one of the most miserable increases ever.  I remember all of these things.</P>
        <P>The annual rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was 5% in March and I know this represented an increase on February.  The increase was higher than expected, as the T&aacute;naiste said, and was well above the forecasts of other analysts.  Inflation in the goods sector was 4.2% in the 12 months to March and this is largely being driven by global markets for raw materials, as has been stated by everyone in every sector of the industry.  It is essential that these externally driven price increases are not pressed more by internal factors that could adversely impact Irish competitiveness.  We must be careful of this.  Some commentators have attributed the higher than expected inflation rate to fuel purchases under hedging arrangements, which reduced the positive effects of the strong euro exchange rate.  There are many reasons for the increase in inflation; some are accurate and others may be somewhat stretched.</P>
        <P>The annual EU measure of inflation, the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, gave a rate of 3.7% in March, up from 3.5%.  This figure was above the EU average and the gap remained unchanged in March so I do not think we should talk it up more than is necessary.  We must work across Departments and agencies to bring inflation into line as quickly as possible and this has already started with the inflation group.  We have already been successful twice in this regard during this decade.</P><Col N="465"/>
        <P>The increase in inflation in the past two years was mainly due to external developments, such as increases in interest rates and European prices.  We must do everything we can in all sectors to bring it under control and this process has been under way since the autumn through the social partnership process involving employers, trade unions and State agencies.  It does not take away from the projections for the Irish economy.  Despite the sub-prime difficulties, difficulties in borrowing and those relating to the inter-bank rate for borrowing, the economy is still in a strong position.  We must get through this period as the forecasts for next year and the second half of this year are still positive.  We must deal with the difficulties that are, mainly, in two or three areas and have been well identified.  I assure the Deputy that they will be carefully watched every month.</P>
        <P>In the short term, the budget day forecast was for growth this year of 2.8% in gross national product, GNP, and 3% in gross domestic product, GDP.  The forecast has not changed in the analysis of the first three months of the year.  We are in a more difficult economic environment, something I have made clear since the autumn, and there is no arguing against the fact that a lower level of the building of new houses has changed some of the forecasts made in the budget.  To hold revenues as projected in the budget will be more demanding and challenging and there is a more challenging external environment.  Practically every country in the OECD, never mind the 27 countries in the European Union, faces these difficulties.  The key is to manage our position as best we can and I assure the Deputy and the House that this is what we are doing not only in the Department of Finance, but in all Departments and State agencies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Taoiseach entered Government in 1997 the inflation rate bequeathed to him was 1.5% and it is now 5%.  Irish exporters and manufacturers who sell goods to the UK face ferocious competition because of the value of sterling versus the euro.  British multiples and companies that sell on the Irish high street blatantly rip-off and exploit Irish consumers with astonishing price mark-ups.</P>
        <P>When the Taoiseach has spare time in the next several weeks, I invite him to take a stroll through Dunnes Stores, Marks and Spencer and other shops operating on both sides of the Border.  He will see items marked at STG&pound;3.50 which are then translated into &euro;6.</P>
        <P>Many public resources go into the Competition Authority.  What kind of competition allows shops to rip-off people?  There are many fine people on the National Consumer Agency.  What are they doing to ensure the translation of prices from sterling is reasonable?  It is a blatant rip-off.</P>
        <P>For some time interest rates have not been increased by the European Central Bank which means it is not driving our inflation rate.  We have a falling construction market and an easing of house prices.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s analysis is wrong.  We are importing a significant amount of inflation through UK multiples and Irish multiples which buy from the UK, making massive profits through the mark-up from sterling to euro.</P>
        <P>Is that fair on the ordinary consumer?  What can &euro;50 buy someone in a supermarket?  How far does &euro;250 go for a family shopping?  It is leaving shopping trolleys half-empty.  What does the Government propose to do about this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency, Departments and the social partners, as they have done three times this decade, have been examining individual sectors of the economy where there are pressures.  Every month those figures are analysed in great detail.  They have used their efforts wherever they believe we need more competition.  The Competition Authority has produced several reports whose recommendations have been implemented to drive competition in certain areas.</P><Col N="466"/>
        <P>If Deputy Burton&rsquo;s argument were true, the only way of beating this inflation would be through more competition.  More aggressive competition is the only way to change that.  It is necessary to move away from cartels.</P>
        <P>While services inflation is higher, it does not cover the areas raised by Deputy Burton.  Taking the figures for the past few months, the consumer price index, CPI, average has been at 3%.  The comparable harmonised consumer price index, HCPI, forecast is 2.4%.  CPI figures for the year to date imply that forecast may come under pressure if the trend does not moderate in the year.  That is the information we have got from the analysis.</P>
        <P>The pick-up in inflation is from the knock-on effect of last year&rsquo;s rise in interest rates, as well as price rises in oil and food.  There is no doubt that the demand and price increases for food have exacerbated it.  There has also been services inflation.</P>
        <P>The efforts of the agencies collectively have been to drive competition or watch price-fixing or price-taking by organisations.  All State agencies have been actively involved in that for the past seven months.</P>

They are upset and angry that a junior counsel on the Garda legal team in 1981 was appointed to head up a new inquiry into the Stardust tragedy.

It is a matter of considerable concern and one which I would not like used as a weapon against the Lisbon treaty which the Fine Gael Party strongly supports.

People are being told that 1 May is the date from which they will not be able to get their medicines without paying for them.  I recognise that a case is before the courts, but this is a matter in which the political system should surely be able to devise a conclusion that will result in an attempt to put in place a system to provide medicines across the country.  In the context of the pharmacy No. 2 Bill, what are the contingency plans to provide medicines and drugs to patients across the country in the event of their being unable to get them after 1 May?</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

When will the financial services regulatory Bill be introduced so that we can debate this matter?</P>
        <P>Another issue causes serious concern.  Two years ago, when a girl in my constituency was killed tragically, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated that it was a watershed.

	<P>Does the Taoiseach believe that the daily ritual of gangland killings is serious enough to intone to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the need to introduce one of the Bills in question or alternative legislation to combat the obvious increase in gangland crime?  Three Bills in particular &mdash; the covert surveillance Bill, the crimes Bill and the criminal justice (confiscation orders) Bill &mdash; will have an impact on organised crime.

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The covert surveillance Bill, a relatively short Bill, is to place existing practices by the security forces on a statutory basis in line with the ECHR obligations.  The draft heads are being finalised on that legislation.  Regarding the confiscation orders Bill, most of the provisions of the framework decision have already been implemented in the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill 2005.

Is he aware that, under the heading of Bills in <Col N="470"/>respect of which heads have been agreed and texts drafted, there is not a single item of legislation from the Department?  What can the Taoiseach do regarding promised legislation?  It is not possible to indicate at this stage the publication date of the dentists Bill, the health corporate bodies Bill, the human tissue Bill, the pharmacy No. 2 Bill or the public health miscellaneous provisions Bill.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the indicated date of publication of the other four Bills in section C, where the heads of the Bill are yet to be approved by the Government, is 2009?  Does the Taoiseach accept there are serious matters amiss within the Department of Health and Children in terms of its responsibilities regarding promised legislation and that they are clearly not being addressed by the Minister he re-appointed, Deputy Harney?</P>

Will the Taoiseach ask the Attorney General to advise whether legislation is necessary to refurbish the compellability law that permits of inquiry by parliamentary committee?  While I do not suggest the 1921 Act is unsuitable in all circumstances to inquire into matters of public interest, most emphatically there are a great many matters that could be inquired into by parliamentary committee.  Since the Abbylara judgment, the view in the House, regardless of whether it is well based in law, is that inquiry by parliamentary committee is not permitted.  We should restore that right.</P>

	<P>Increasingly, I find people to be highly sceptical about the Lisbon treaty.  In part this is because they have no sense that the Government is seriously engaged in explaining the treaty&rsquo;s terms to them, with the possible exception of one or two Ministers.  It is understandable that people who have a deep antipathy towards Europe and the various European treaties should be highly critical.  On the whole, many people regard Europe as having been very good for Ireland.  They recognise that while it is not perfect, the country has done well from its membership and that, in particular, issues such as employment rights and the rights of women in respect of work, working conditions and pay have advanced significantly through our membership of the European Union.</P>
        <P>However, there is an enormous deficit in respect of the Government&rsquo;s engagement in the argument.  The point has been reached at which many of its supporters have asked why they should bother to vote if the Government does not care.  Consequently the challenge for the Government is to put some effort and thought into explaining what is a complex treaty.  It should explain it and should convince its own supporters that it is worthwhile to vote for it.  Otherwise, the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach designate, should recall that on a previous occasion when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, he misread a European treaty and we ended up by having Nice I and Nice II.</P>
        <P>I can understand that the Government parties, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il, have been somewhat paralysed by the drama of the political events associated with a change in leadership.  However, when will the leading party in the Government, Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; I except one or two Ministers &mdash; engage?  Unless it does so, people will be sceptical.  In their ordinary weekly shopping, people face extraordinary levels of price increases.  They face extraordinary conversion rates from sterling to euro.  Moreover, perhaps 100,000 people who bought houses at the height of the property market face some degree of negative equity.  This morning, someone stopped me at the railway station.  This is a matter of which everybody is aware.  Their son, a qualified carpenter, lost his job when he was not invited to return to his site after Christmas and has subsequently been unable to find other employment.  As he only recently qualified, he faces a gap before he can set himself up in business.  In the context of the serious economic difficulties being experienced by families and individuals throughout the country, if Fianna F&aacute;il does not seem to care about explaining the treaty to people and making detailed arguments as to why people should vote for it, why would the electorate be bothered to vote?</P>
        <P>With many other Deputies, I spent time last week speaking with groups of farmers from various parts of the country.  Without exception, they said they were always broadly in favour of Europe but expressed concerns about the WTO negotiations and the lack of engagement by <Col N="474"/>Ministers in Ireland&rsquo;s interest.  Irrespective of the potential benefits of the WTO for the Third World, the Government is required to serve the legitimate interests of Irish farmers and their families.  It seems, however, that it is not engaged in that regard.  I advise the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach-in-waiting, that he better get the troops out if he wants to win on Lisbon and the Ministers better get out of their cars to meet the people on the streets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this debate on the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  On the last point raised by Deputy Burton, I would not expect her to be completely <i>au fait </i> with Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s activity and the 50 meetings that have been held in recent weeks or that will be held in the weeks to come.  These meetings, which are being held in all parts of the country, are open to the public and have been very well attended.  Only last Friday night, I attended one such meeting in Cork which attracted as many as 500 people.  The Deputy can rest assured that Fianna F&aacute;il intends to do all it can.  We will commence an active campaign when we officially launch it in the coming weeks.  </P>
        <P>I will address some of the specific aspects of the reform treaty and explain why it is imperative that Ireland endorses it, but first I want to put the treaty in a wider context.  The forthcoming referendum will be the sixth referendum on a European treaty since I was first honoured to be elected to this House.  While I have played an active role in each treaty, I was particularly involved in the Treaty of Nice because I helped to negotiate it as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Each referendum has had its own character and threw up its own issues but the basic arguments on both sides have tended to be similar.  This is because in essence the debates have revolved around competing visions of Europe and of Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  Most of the time, those of us who support Ireland&rsquo;s active engagement in a developing European Union have been able to connect with the public.  We have been able to draw on the underlying positive attitude of the Irish people towards Europe, as indicated in recent eurobarometer polls, to persuade them to come out to the polling stations and convince them that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote makes sense for them personally, for their families and their communities and for the nation.</P>
        <P>While we can never take the electorate for granted, I believe that we will succeed on this occasion and that the people will vote to ratify the reform treaty.  The arguments in favour are unassailable and I have absolute confidence in the maturity and good sense of the Irish public.  However, not least from my experience of the first Nice  referendum, I am aware that one should never be complacent.  It is not enough merely to make the case, it has to be made in a way that persuades busy people that their personal stake in the outcome is sufficient to make it worthwhile for them to exercise their franchise.  It also means ensuring that every voter feels that he or she has sufficient knowledge of the issues involved to make an informed choice.  This requires those of us who argue in favour of the treaty and of Europe to do all we can to set out the issues involved clearly and simply.  We must also examine the points we are advancing to determine whether they are indeed relevant to the lives, aspirations and anxieties of the voters.</P>
        <P>In many ways, the fundamental arguments in favour of the treaty are the same as they were in successive referendums since 1972.  Their truth has been amply demonstrated by experience.  The European Union is, above all, about consolidating peace and democracy across the European Continent.  What was the scene of the bloodiest wars in the history of the world and the most sustained and murderous genocide is now peaceful.  Old enmities have been cast aside in favour of partnership and co-operation, and war between the members of the Union is now unthinkable.  The record shows that membership of the Union, and indeed the prospect of membership, has strengthened and sustained young democracies in southern and eastern Europe.</P><Col N="475"/>
        <P>If we did not have a European Union when communism imploded, how would the progressive forces in those countries have given a vision on reconstructing their societies in accordance with equality and the rule of law?  We would have reverted to the narrow nationalism which characterised past political development in those countries.  I remind Deputies that the evidence is before our eyes.  Yugoslavia imploded because of a refusal to look upon the European Union as that country&rsquo;s political destiny.  Other countries looked to the EU as a pole of stability and an opportunity for reintegration into the Continent of Europe, with the result that, during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency in 2004, I had the great privilege of attending &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in as they returned to the European fold.</P>
        <P>The Union has also helped to create and underpin economic growth and prosperity throughout Europe.  The Single Market and economic and monetary union have helped to create the largest and most affluent consumer market in the world.  Barriers to trade and investment have been swept aside in a way that respects social solidarity, the environment and the cultural particularities of each member state.</P>
        <P>As we all know and as we ought constantly to remind ourselves, Ireland has perhaps gained more than any other country from EU membership.  The scale and pace of our transformation have been dramatic.  The radical change in our economic situation was largely based on being able to take advantage of the Single Market to attract inward investment, find new customers and escape undue dependence on the British market.  Twice as many Irish people are at work now compared with the beginning of the 1990s and the country is dramatically wealthier.  While we are now funding our own ambitious national development plan, support from the Structural Funds was crucial in earlier investment in our infrastructure and human capital.</P>
        <P>Irish agriculture continues to depend hugely on the Common Agricultural Policy, even after the sweeping reforms it has undergone.  Thankfully, former Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ray MacSharry, was able to steward those reforms in ways that allowed new opportunities for Irish agriculture.  On the basis of what has been agreed for funding the CAP until 2013, I contend that Europe must remain the focus of agricultural interests and promoting Irish agriculture.  The increase in commodity prices which, thankfully, is improving incomes in our farming community and the fact that our agriculture is grass based provides us with an excellent opportunity to enhance our competitiveness, particularly in respect of beef, because our competitors must face the recent hikes in the cost of grain and other commodities.</P>
        <P>Rather than considering this issue negatively, we will continue to monitor and address the challenges.  Today, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food met her German counterpart to discuss issues which will ensure the mandate of the Commission continues to respect the need to avoid dislocating markets in Europe, particularly given the importance of beef to the development of our agricultural industries.  We should not consider that aspect solely in respect of the WTO, important as the upcoming negotiations will be.  Let us be clear that the worst case scenario will not be allowed to happen in that respect.  We must also consider the European Union development of agriculture in the context of freer trade generally.  Using the sensitive product regime and the quota system provides us with the mechanisms within what is happening at the Geneva negotiations to protect us quite adequately in that respect.</P>
        <P>Obviously, the Government is continually monitoring this, and our Minister is acutely aware of developments in that arena and informs the Government on a weekly basis.  I hope that one of the great positive constituencies for European Union development in Ireland, namely, the farming and agricultural community and the rural community, will look to this context as a means by which we will continue to adapt, modernise and improve our agriculture, rather than succumbing to the idea that we are in a static situation that would see a downward spiral.</P><Col N="476"/>
        <P>The European Union has been a steadfast partner in the search for peace in Northern Ireland.  Today, it is still helping to entrench the settlement by supporting cross-community reconciliation.  Only last Monday, I visited Mr. Peter Robinson, the First Minister designate in the new Administration and the present Minister for Finance, and with Commissioner Danuta H&uuml;bner from Poland helped launch the PEACE III and INTERREG programmes in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out the PEACE III programme is the only country-specific programme in any part of the European Union to promote reconciliation.  We all know from the history of Europe and the changing borders within the European Continent how much of a case could be made for many border communities throughout the European Union to try to obtain that type of funding.  To be fair, the European Union has always shown the principle of solidarity towards this country in helping to resolve conflict on the island, and this continues to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro.  Funding is provided for 7,000 projects on the ground, across communities which have been divided traditionally not only by the Border but by the conflict itself.  Let us not forget the tremendous seed corn of reconciliation and <i>rapprochement</i> those funds represented in terms of the ability of communities which were in the past divided to find common ground and interests and move forward together.  This is something we should not take for granted and it should be highlighted as an attribute of the European Union that has had a very positive effect in our efforts at peace building in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The example of the Union was crucially important to leaders such as John Hume.  In the bleakest days of the Troubles, it helped to demonstrate that peace between the bitterest of enemies was possible though practical partnership.  Working together as equals in the European Union context has added an important new dimension to the relationship between British and Irish political leaders, just as working with other Europeans has helped to liberate us from an excessive preoccupation and fixation with Britain.  If the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone are today looking down benignly on their people, the European Union can rightly claim at least some of the credit.</P>
        <P>Let us not forget that Ireland has also undergone a social transformation during the period of our membership.  In many ways we are a more tolerant, open and equal society.  The attachment of the Union to equality and non-discrimination has been a driving force behind this change.  We were reminded of this fact last week on the demise of Dr. Patrick Hillery, given his singular achievement in bringing forward the equal pay directive as social affairs commissioner at that time.  Irish women and men, as citizens and as workers, have benefitted from increased opportunity and improved quality of life.</P>
        <P>When, in Eurobarometer polls, citizens across Europe are asked if membership of the Union has been of benefit to their country, we are consistently among the most positive of all.  This is entirely rational and understandable.  I have no doubt that for most Irish people their view of Europe has been formed and continues to be formed by some or all of the factors I have listed.  However, we need to ask ourselves, as we near the end of the first decade of the 21st century, if these arguments alone will continue to shape the thinking of young Irish people, those whose support for the European Union project will be crucial in the decades ahead.</P>
        <P>It is worth recalling that even the last people born during the Second World War are close to retirement age.  For their grandchildren the idea of war between France and Germany is ancient history.  The youngest voters in June&rsquo;s referendum will have been born after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  How meaningful do they find appeals to recall the European unification of Germany and of Europe?  They have grown up in an affluent and confident Ireland.  They do not remember how things were in the 1970s and 1980s, nor can they be expected to appreciate <Col N="477"/>the scale of the change the European Union has helped bring to our country.  How then do we convince them that they should follow their parents in appreciating the importance of the Union and voting to support this treaty?</P>
        <P>The key to that question lies in the fact that this generation of young Irish people is by far the best travelled and outward-looking ever.  They are idealistic and they are also conscious that the world is changing in ways which will pose great challenges to how they will live.  The European Union has a central role to play in responding to those challenges, and this treaty is important in helping equip it to do so.</P>
        <P>Climate change threatens the world&rsquo;s environmental and ecological balance.  Its consequences for us all, and above all for the world&rsquo;s poorest and most vulnerable people, are potentially catastrophic.  It is our children and grandchildren who are most at risk of experiencing the worst and most dramatic changes.  Even within the past 12 months, the price of basic foodstuffs has risen and in some places doubled &mdash; the price of rice has doubled and desertification and the level of flooding continues to increase throughout the world.  There is a real problem for the poorest of the poor.</P>
        <P>The European Union, as a regional entity, is the largest contributor of overseas development aid in the world.  Young Irish people want to know in what way they can contribute to making sure the world tries to deal with these pressing latest problems.  There is a continuing imbalance between north and south trade that we must at some stage resolve if we are to deal with the issues of migration, justice and the ability of people to fend for themselves in their own countries which, thankfully, this generation in Ireland is experiencing for the first time since Independence.  If they want to make a constructive contribution and try to do something about this, voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 12 June is a means by which they can do it.  They can take up the democratic challenge and vote for something which will equip the European Union to be more effectively a partner with other parts of the world in dealing with these pressing problems, not just for the future but as issues are happening now and as we see changes taking place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having listened to the managing director of the World Food Programme only last weekend, there is a depletion of stocks to historically low levels, the worst in 30 years, because of what has been happening.  This is not only because of environmental and climate change, desertification and drought but also because commodity prices have changed fundamentally in the past 12 months in a way that has not been seen with the price levels of basic commodities for some time.</P>
        <P>These are the means by which we can put the case to young people and people generally in Ireland that the European Union is not simply about markets or economics.  It is also about being a force for good in the world.  The European Union has been the mechanism for the transformation of Europe.  When we saw the implosion of communism only 17 or 18 years ago, what would have been the political, economic and social development of Europe if we did not have the European Union&rsquo;s example of what practical co-operation between states can bring?  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.  Those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side need to convince me and those like me as to the basis on which the Europe we see today would have progressed without the European Union being in place.  There is no doubt it has been the revolution of ideas by reason of co-operation rather than competition that has changed the political balance of Europe and brought stability to it, when in the past it was a Continent that was a byword for genocide and war.  Young people are to the forefront in demanding and expecting a political response to these issues that are transnational in nature.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government pledges us to take a series of ambitious steps, above all in curbing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy.  We are determined that this programme will be implemented and our specific targets met over the four <Col N="478"/>years remaining in the life of the Government.  However, it is obvious that Ireland cannot do much by itself.  Internationally, it is Europe that is continuing to take the global lead in combating climate change.  As was reaffirmed at the recent European Council meeting, the European Union is pledged to make major cuts in emissions by 2020, even if these cuts are unilateral.  We will make still more significant cuts if we succeed in winning sufficient commitments from others.</P>
        <P>The European Union is at the heart of that important international debate and it has the huge task of trying to persuade the United States and the major industrialising states such as China and others of the need to go in the right direction.  This treaty, for the first time, specifically recognises the issue of climate change, at the behest of the Government, in the negotiations.  It confers upon the Union the competences it needs in this field and in that of energy policy generally, a major strategic issue for Europe going forward.  Is it seriously suggested that Ireland can enhance its energy security policy without working with others, given the sources from where our natural gas supply will come in the years ahead and the importance of the European Union having the collective capacity to develop a bilateral relationship with the Russian Federation in a way that enhances the prospect of security supply rather than allows the fragmented Europe to be manipulated for its own particular internal domestic political reasons by a Russian Federation that would have a greater leverage than would otherwise be the case if the European Union did not exist?  These are fundamentally important questions.</P>
        <P>Another area in which Europe is a world leader is that of development.  Many young Irish people, whether as volunteers, donors or activists, expect to see such leadership.  Collectively, through the efforts of member states and of the Commission, the European Union is easily the largest aid donor internationally in terms of absolute and relative expenditure.  That strong commitment to maintain that role, with the specific target of  the 15 longer-standing member states reaching the target of 0.7% by 2015, is something we have pledged to do by 2012.  While I would not claim that all European aid is fully effective or as well co-ordinated as it should be, Europe is indeed to the forefront in honouring its obligations and in pressing others to do so.</P>
        <P>During the course of this debate there will be many other opportunities to amplify and articulate further on these and other questions, but this House must make the debate relevant for people not on the basis of the past <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre </i>for the European Union but for the future, and explain the reason it is important that a Union of 27, perhaps more, must have the basic tools and mechanisms for a decision making capacity that is effective and fair and that honours the basic solidarity between states that is at the heart of the Union&rsquo;s success to date.  If people are enabled to examine this debate in that context, all Irish people, particularly our young people who are looking for a need to affiliate politically, not only in national terms but in international terms, will find that the European Union, and our being at the centre of that Union and all its activities, is the best way Ireland can show it is an international citizen upon which those who are less fortunate than ourselves can depend.</P>

	<P>It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on the Lisbon treaty.  As a fairly new backbencher, it is not always easy to get speaking time and when one <Col N="479"/>gets the opportunity to speak on an issue as important as the Lisbon treaty, I am glad to take that opportunity.</P>
        <P>I listened to the T&aacute;naiste speak about the youngest people who will vote in this referendum.  The youngest people who will vote in this referendum were born in the early 1990s.  I am a child of the 1970s and during my second level education in the CBS in Gorey, I went on a school tour to Dachau.  I do not know if anybody knows where Dachau is but it was one of the first concentration camps established by the Nazi regime.  Something that struck me on that visit was that we, as young people in our teens, were told that what happened in Dachau could never happen in Europe again, but little did any of us realise that within a decade, within a few hundred miles of that concentration camp, it happened again in what was then Yugoslavia.  One of the reasons it happened was that Europe was not strong.  It was unable to deal with the issue.  NATO and the United States had to come in and try to resolve what was an appalling act of genocide by one nation on another.</P>
        <P>Many people have questioned the need for the Lisbon treaty when the process appears to be working well.  The European Union cannot expand from 300 million to 500 million people and assume that the procedures in place are sufficient.  I have used the analogy that it is the equivalent of merging Canada, the United States of America, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean Island nations into one trading entity similar to the European Union.  The entire population of that area is 500 million people.  There are no circumstances in which that could happen and they have a far greater benefit in that approximately 350 million of them speak primarily one language.  Ten were brought in, the 15 went to 25 and now it is 27.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The EU is perhaps the greatest political democracy in the history of mankind.  Ireland is very fortunate &mdash; I am absolutely pro-Europe &mdash; that we took the opportunity to play our part in the European Union.  Who would have believed that just a decade after the Second World War Germany and France could have got together and started what has evolved into the European Union?  I heard the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, give concise historical detail on how the EU came about, but we must not forget &mdash; the T&aacute;naiste touched upon this &mdash; that twice during the 20th century Europe went to war on a scale that nobody could have believed possible.</P>
        <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Burton about the campaign.  It has been lethargic and slow, and regardless of whether the Government likes it, there is a perception that it has been lethargic in starting the campaign on the Lisbon treaty.  I believe it was Disraeli who said that a lie is half way around the world before truth gets its boots on.  I am not saying those people who are advocating a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote are lying but they are getting a far better hearing than anyone would have anticipated at the early stage of the campaign.  Many people are following the campaign in the United States.  We all know it is very difficult to decrease momentum but the momentum appears to be on the side of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign.  I say to those on the Government benches that it is time to ditch the lethargy and get on with campaigning to ensure the public gets the message that the Lisbon treaty will be a benefit and that it is not something about which it needs to be concerned.</P>
        <P>The treaty is aimed at making Europe a more effective and efficient trading and political bloc.  Measures will be introduced to streamline the representation, making the Parliament and the Commission much more effective and less unwieldy.  It will lead to faster decision-making in the areas on which we must proceed, including global warming, in terms of what happened in the 1990s in Yugoslavia and the current problem of energy and food security or, as they are now being called, energy and food insecurity.  It will make the Union more democratic.  Some people are trying to cloud the issue about qualified majority voting.  Ireland has a strong benefit in that regard in that we are punching way above our weight on the issue.</P><Col N="480"/>
        <P>I want to touch upon the issue of taxation.  There has been much talk that if the Lisbon treaty is accepted the EU will have a unified corporation tax.  Mr. Barroso, President of the European Union, was here last week and he could not have been more clear that that will not happen.  Ireland benefited greatly from the progressive corporation tax rates introduced here in the mid-1990s.  Other countries are looking to our success and will try to mimic it.  It has worked well for Ireland and they will ask why it cannot work for other countries within the European Union.  The other countries looking to compete for foreign direct investment jobs will bring their corporation tax rates down.  The challenge for us is to get on with changing the current position.  What stood for us well in the past 12 to 14 years will not stand for us well in the next 12 to 14 years.  Switzerland is not a member of the European Union but is one of two countries competing better than anywhere else in Europe &mdash; the other being Austria, where a zero corporation tax rate is offered.  We must accept that we will not be able to leave our corporation tax rates as they are.</P>
        <P>The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union will become legally binding.  The treaty will make the charter law, thus giving people recourse to the European Court of Justice.  Some concerns have been stated in this regard.  I also have some concerns.  It will be a matter for the European Court of Justice to adjudicate and it will make its decisions and rulings.  As the charter will become law, it will be incumbent on each member state to ensure national laws are compatible with European Union laws.</P>
        <P>Will the treaty strengthen the European Union?  It will, as there will be greater cohesion and unity.  It will also create a stronger voice at a time when it has never been more necessary.  The European &ldquo;nation&rdquo; is facing a global economic downturn which will affect every country to some degree.  A strong and united voice will be critical in World Trade Organisation negotiations, upon which I will touch.</P>
        <P>The agriculture sector has been very good to Ireland for decades.  The European Union closed down the Irish sugar beet industry and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food did not cover herself in glory in how she handled the matter.  We should not pretend or beat about the bush on the issue &mdash; she was poor.  She now has a significant challenge with the beef industry, as the industry here is very different from that anywhere else.  It is grass-based and has a lower cost base as a result.  We must export 90% of our product, although we do not produce a very significant amount.  As beef must be exported, we are left in a position where we are absolutely obliged to ensure the markets to which we are exporting remain open and lucrative.  If this does not happen and there is a flood of international beef traded on the surplus markets into the European Union, the Irish beef industry, in particular, will take a much harder hit than that in any other country.  Although it is hard to believe because of the amount of beef we actually produce, we are the fourth largest exporter of beef internationally.</P>
        <P>In terms of fair trade, I speak as a commercial dairy farmer.  It is inconceivable to me that there are world dairy shortages.  We are coming to the end of the quota year and farmers will be charged for oversupplying quota at a time when there is an international shortage.  That makes no sense to me and at some stage the matter will have to be dealt with.  Despite an international shortage, Irish farmers will be charged a super levy because of oversupply.  That is a little rich.</P>
        <P>For the first time in the history of the European Union, we are reaching the point where we will not be capable of supplying our own market with required foodstuffs, let alone export to other markets.  Rice has doubled in price, while the cost of wheat is up 80% or 90%.  The price of barley is also up.  The price of every product on world trade markets has increased by between 50% and 100%.  One of the major reasons is bio-fuels.  I support all products from the <Col N="481"/>land but to produce bio-fuels, an acre of land is required to produce two tonnes of crop which is processed into three quarters of a tonne of oil.  That makes no sense, as the scale that we need to produce oils will not be achieved.  In time, the position we have taken internationally on bio-fuels will be seen as a crime against humanity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has gained enormously from being a member of the European Union, to the tune of $58 billion in receipts from the EU budget.  There have been billions received in Structural Funds which have helped us construct roads and improve the rail network.  Farmers have also benefited significantly.  However, they are using the Lisbon treaty to influence the World Trade Organisation talks and are not wrong to do so.  People in business use every opportunity possible and there is now an opportunity for the Government to act.  I was glad to hear the Taoiseach state today that he will use the veto with regard to the talks.  We must make it very clear to the European Union, Mr. Peter Mandelson in particular, that we will not accept the sell-out of Irish agriculture.  The sector is worth billions of euro annually to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>Membership of the European Union also confers responsibility and we are responsible for being a committed member.  If all the political parties in favour of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote played a role and got on with the matter, the treaty will be passed in the referendum.  As I stated, the momentum is with the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side, from which certain myths have emanated, one of which is that the treaty could possibly lead to the legalisation of abortion within the State.  The treaty will do the opposite, as it confers upon the State the right to deal with all of its own health issues.  The Irish position is clear.  The treaty strengthens it &mdash; it will be a matter for the State to deal with the issue internally.  Neither the European Commission, the European Court of Justice nor anybody else will be able to make a decision and force Ireland to accept the legalisation of abortion.</P>
        <P>There is a suggestion the treaty will lead to the creation of a super state, which many would decry.  The treaty will not lead to this; instead it sets out how it will bring democracy to the European Union.  The European Union has a responsibility to limit certain areas and a super state will certainly not come about.</P>
        <P>There is also a suggestion being peddled that we will be forced into joining a European army.  That will certainly not happen.  Ireland&rsquo;s position on the matter is quite clear.  Its neutral standpoint has always been respected within the European Union. Participation in peacekeeping and crisis intervention missions is optional for each member state, rather than an obligation.  This could not be any more clear but, unfortunately, the idea has been mooted that Ireland will be part of a military alliance.  It is very difficult to argue that this is not the case.  More often than not the word gets out and some organisations advocating a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote will argue against the truth.  We can continue to decide to participate in peacekeeping missions on a case by case basis, taking into account what we have agreed within the European Union.  This incorporates the triple lock principle, which requires the support of the Government, the Legislature and a United Nations mandate.  Ireland has a very proud record of involvement in UN and EU peacekeeping missions during the years in places such as Kosovo and Bosnia.  Most recently we had a significant debate on whether we should send our troops to Chad.</P>
        <P>Further myths and untruths have been spread with regard to immigration.  The treaty adds nothing new in respect of EU emigrants entering Ireland.  When we signed the Treaty of Rome in 1973, we agreed to the free movement of workers within the European Union.  The Union, which now comprises 27 member states, has been of major benefit to Ireland since the early to mid-1990s.  Many people involved in commerce have benefited from the labour that entered our market when it was badly needed.</P>
        <P>It has been stated that EU membership will now begin to cost us money.  We have received many billions of euro &mdash; either in respect of infrastructure or through the CAP &mdash; and we must <Col N="482"/>at some stage realise that it is time we stepped up to the mark and signalled our willingness to transfer funds from our country to other member states.  The benefit of doing so is that when those states become more flath&uacute;ileach, they will hopefully become consumers of Irish products.</P>
        <P>I agree with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s comment to the effect that we must make this debate relevant to Irish citizens.  Due to the fact that the requisite information is not available and also that members of the public are obtaining information and hearing more coherent arguments from those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side, it is not being made relevant.  I appeal to all of the parties in the House to get the campaign moving and reverse the momentum from the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side to the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Finian McGrath.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the legislation and the issue to which it relates.  I wish to highlight a number of reasons I believe Ireland should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum on the EU reform treaty.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste dealt briefly with the myth being put about by the parties that Deputies D&rsquo;Arcy and Burton represent to the effect that Fianna F&aacute;il and its Ministers are not active and organised in respect of the campaign.  None of the parties has officially launched their campaigns as yet.  Last week I attended open meetings in two different parts of the country which were organised by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the treaty and explain it to people.  Members of the Green Party, the IFA and Fine Gael attended the meetings to which I refer.  I also attended a number of meetings in my constituency at which the treaty was discussed and explained.  I do not want the myth created by Fine Gael and the Labour Party to gain any credence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>The perception is out there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s assertion that the momentum is with the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.  Nor do I accept his criticism of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coughlan, in respect of the WTO negotiations.  The criticism he has levelled is unfair, unbalanced and inaccurate.  It is well recognised among members of the farming community that whereas a majority of EU member states were inclined towards agreement on the proposals put forward by Peter Mandelson, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has persuaded most of them to change their position and oppose them.  The Minister, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach have built alliances in Europe that are of assistance in ensuring our national interests are protected.</P>
        <P>In some ways, this is a good example of the role Ireland plays in Europe and the respect in which it is held by other member states.  Ireland, which is a small nation, had major influence in the past and can continue to exert such influence in the future.  I attended several Council of Europe meetings in the aftermath of the first referendum on the Nice treaty.  Europe was a lonely place for us at that stage, particularly because the people had voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the treaty.  I do not want to see a repeat performance.</P>
        <P>At the core of the treaty is the need to ensure the EU institutions are reformed in order that many new initiatives can be implemented to help the European economy grow and prosper.  Europe needs to implement the treaty so it can become more competitive and meet the changes that are evident in the political and business arenas.</P>
        <P>After 50 years, the European Union must modernise the way it does its business.  I accept that it has changed and that various treaties were implemented during the past 50 years.  However, it is imperative to reform the Union in order that it can face up to a new set of challenges.  Ireland <Col N="483"/>and other EU member states are not the only countries in the world seeking to secure higher levels of inward investment and compete in an increasingly globalised world.  We compete for new business in that world against other trading blocs including India, China, Brazil and many other emerging countries in Asia.  Europe and Ireland cannot, therefore, afford to stand still.  We must be at the top of our game and the EU reform treaty will assist us in this regard.</P>
        <P>The treaty contains important new provisions that strengthen the EU&rsquo;s ability to fight cross-border crime, illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, arms and drugs.  Due to the fact that it has a different legal system to most of its EU partners, Ireland will rely on the procedure contained in the treaty which enables it to opt in or out on a case-by-case basis.  This, again, is a good example of a community working in partnership and recognising differences within individual member states.  It is our intention to work closely with our EU partners in respect of the areas to which I refer.  The treaty will allow us to do so without, in any way, compromising our legal systems or procedures.</P>
        <P>When it comes to institutional changes, and despite the arguments being peddled by some people, Ireland will have exactly the same right to representation on the European Commission as Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Spain and all the other member states, large and small.  Ireland will retain its EU Commissioner until 2014 and thereafter will have a place on the Commission on the basis of a system of strict equality among all member states of the EU.</P>
        <P>As in the past, the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side has referred to two red herrings.  In that context, I reiterate that the treaty will not diminish Ireland&rsquo;s status as a neutral country by one iota nor will it threaten our ability to set our own taxes.  On the latter point, there is no ambiguity in respect of the taxation issue.  None of the provisions in the reform treaty relating to taxation will affect our status.  All aspects of taxation remain within the competence of individual member states.  The Government is committed to maintaining its policy in this regard.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I found it startling to hear somebody who had claimed to have read the treaty go on to say he found it difficult to read and could not understand it.  He further proved it by saying it would affect our corporation tax status.  It was serious enough to have somebody coming out in that manner but that individual was given first place on the news by our national broadcaster.  Meanwhile, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who was able to show the importance of the European Union in job creation &mdash; 136,000 because of foreign direct investment &mdash; was relegated to second place on the same news bulletin.  There is something seriously wrong when that can arise, but I suppose we will be told that this is all done in the interests of balance.</P>
        <P>The other red herring I mentioned was our neutrality which has been stated by Deputies on all sides of the House.  It is worth reiterating the point because it is a worry.  Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality is not in any way compromised or affected by the treaty.  That is a fact and remains so.</P>
        <P>Leaving aside the red herrings and negative points made, we should vote for the treaty because it is in Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests to stay as an active and central member of the European Union.  Companies which wish to use Ireland as a gateway to the EU marketplace of 500 million citizens want Ireland to remain as a committed member state of the Union.  That is certainly the way we want to do it also.</P>
        <P>The treaty improves democracy within the European Union.  It will reform the way in which the Union does its business.  It respects the importance of rights and freedoms for each and every one of us.  It gives a new role in EU affairs to national parliaments, including the Oireachtas.  It will give more influence to the citizens of Europe.  It will deal with problems that would be impossible for us to deal with effectively on our own.  It is better to be part of the Union to deal with such matters.  The treaty will give the European Union, including Ireland, <Col N="484"/>a voice that will be more clearly heard in world affairs in support of human rights and democratic values.  That is why it is important for the people to give a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to the treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, Sir, for affording me the opportunity of contributing to this important debate on the Lisbon treaty.  I also thank the Minister for sharing time with me, even though I take an opposing view.  It is important to hear the different views in this debate.  As an Independent Deputy, I must constantly challenge and test the treaty on behalf of citizens.  I accept that it may not be popular to do so but it is essential for everyone to hear all the facts.  This debate is about the Lisbon treaty.  I accept that it is not about the European Union and the positive aspects of European co-operation.  While I may criticise and challenge, I will also present my view on the European Union and the broader international scene.  Let us put to bed the isolationist tag mentioned by some previous speakers. </P>
        <P>In my broader vision for Europe and Ireland, I seek to extend popular sovereignty and promote democratic values in Irish life.  I oppose EU supranational control at all levels of society and seek to counteract its dominance in Irish life.  I want to defend and enhance our national democracy and accountability, thus ensuring the maximum amount of power for decision making will be in the hands of the Irish people.  My long-term aim is to establish more equal and democratic relations between all the nations and peoples of Europe, from the Urals to the Atlantic.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the progressive transfer of power from the elected representatives of the people to unaccountable supranational institutions.  In my vision for Europe I support the development and enhancement of national and local democracy.  I want close co-operation with neighbouring EU member states.  I believe in moving towards a more socially desirable, environmentally aware and sustainable model of development.  I am opposed to proposals that increase the competence of the European Union or reduce the influence of member states.  I seek a devolution of powers from the European Union to national level, and from national to local level, in order to increase democratic control and promote a culture of political participation.  I am opposed to all measures of liberalisation involving the transfer of services or utilities from public to private ownership.</P>
        <P>I seek the maintenance of Irish neutrality and oppose membership of any military alliance.  The drift towards membership of such an alliance is the issue in this debate.  My vision includes the development of an independent foreign policy based on support for human rights, national self-determination and economic solidarity with the exploited peoples and countries of the world.  This is my vision for Ireland and Europe and it is one that many in this country understand and support.</P>
        <P>I note that most contributors to the debate have not examined the details of the treaty.  I am concerned that it will endorse the creation of a centralised and militarised super state.  It will also strengthen the European Union internationally through the establishment of a permanent EU President, foreign Minister and a department of foreign affairs.  I am also concerned about the incorporation of the European Defence Agency, EDA, into the European treaties.  The purpose of the EDA is to promote the European arms industry which accounts for 29% of global arms sales, as well as assisting the development of the European Union&rsquo;s defence capabilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the terms of the treaty, there is an obligation on member states to increase their military capacity.  An expansion of the so-called Petersberg Tasks is to be carried out by the <Col N="485"/>European Union&rsquo;s military and civilian forces, to include combating terrorism and possible pre-emptive military action against perceived threats.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>A new innovation called &ldquo;structured co-operation&rdquo; allows for mini-military alliances to be established within the structures of the European Union in order to carry out &ldquo;more demanding missions&rdquo;.  Mutual solidarity and mutual defence clauses will oblige all member states to come to the assistance of any member state subjected to armed aggression.  It is important to point to these issues.</P>
        <P>Article 28.3 of the treaty states:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Member states shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities.  The agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments shall identify operational requirements, shall promote measures to satisfy those requirements, shall contribute to identifying and, where appropriate, implementing any measure needed to strengthen an industrial and technological base of the defence sector, shall participate in defining a European capabilities and armaments policy, and shall assist the Council in evaluating the improvement of military capabilities&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These are the facts.</P>
        <P>As regards the broader issue, I have legitimate concerns that Ireland has only 12 members out of 750 in the European Parliament.  I am also concerned that two thirds of Irish laws now come from Brussels.  I am concerned, too, that some 95% of the Lisbon treaty is from the rejected European Union constitution.  That is the hidden agenda in this debate.  The European treaty would be far superior.</P>
        <P>That is a summary of my concerns and it is essential for the public to hear them.  As regards the broader debate, it is important to let the people know that 80% of Members of the House and practically 90% of the media support the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side.  Hence, as an Independent Deputy, I will always raise such concerns.  There are serious democratic questions to be raised on the issues of balance and proper information.</P>
        <P>Article 9.2 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;Fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental political duties of all citizens&rdquo;.  As an Independent Deputy, all I want to do is achieve the intent of that article.  I do not want to pledge my loyalty to any other state.</P>
        <P>Let us deal with the economic issue, to which the Minister referred.  The recent statement by the French finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, that the common consolidated tax base is &ldquo;one issue that we are determined to push&rdquo;, has seen people in Brussels and Dublin go into damage limitation mode to try to limit the perception that this would be the first step to a common corporation tax rate.  Commissioner McCreevy identified this measure as a long-term hidden agenda for a common corporation tax base.  He described it as a sinister idea that refused to die and added that permanent officials in the Commission were seeking to impose deliberately unworkable proposals that amounted to a Trojan horse to enable the Commission to take control of taxation issues.</P>
        <P>Let us examine the detail further.  Article 93 of the Lisbon treaty proposes an important amendment to Article 113 of the consolidated treaties which makes harmonised company tax laws across the European Union a mandatory requirement, although it must be done by unanimity.  The amendment states such harmonisation must take place, if necessary, to avoid distortion of competition, allowing a country or firm to take a case before the European Court of Justice alleging that, for example, lreland&rsquo;s 12.5% rate of company tax constitutes a distortion of competition compared to Germany&rsquo;s 30% rate.  It is legitimate to raise these issues.</P>
        <P>Article 42(2) states: &ldquo;The common security and defence policy shall include the progressive framing of a common Union defence policy.&rdquo;  This will lead to a common defence policy.  I <Col N="486"/>object to some countries and their foreign policies.  It is legitimate for an Irish Deputy to challenge them.</P>
        <P>I conclude by quoting the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Jean Claude Juncker, on the issue of sovereignty, a legitimate concern.  He stated: &ldquo;Of course there will be transfers of sovereignty.  But would I be intelligent to draw the attention of the public to this fact?&rdquo;  The answer must be that any Irish politician of integrity must do so, irrespective of the personal or political cost.  Fundamentally, the treaty provides for a massive shift of power from the nations of the European Union to Brussels, effectively making us a province of Europe.  These are the concerns I raise.</P>
        <P>We need an honest debate, with less name calling, with openness and vision to ensure all people of the world, not just those in the European Union, can live in peace, justice and harmony.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important issue of the Lisbon treaty.  I will be voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and campaigning for others to do the same.  The new treaty is absolutely necessary to streamline and simplify the structures that we need for our 27 member union in the next period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is the right of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to complain about Fine Gael and what some of its people were saying but I draw his attention, while he is in the Chamber, to a well organised meeting of the Forum for Europe in Monaghan.  The two main speakers addressing it were Deputy Margaret Conlon who did a good job on behalf of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign and Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who did his own thing for the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign.  I was most worried by the fact that, out of a large crowd, two people from the floor spoke in favour of the treaty, Councillor Se&aacute;n McKiernan from County Cavan and me.  A number of farming organisation representatives spoke in the negative but not one of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues bothered to get involved.  The main body of the crowd spoke against it.  If we are to win the treaty referendum, as is my wish, it is important that those who believe in the European Union get out and sell it.  Those who are against it are the same types, if not the same, of individuals who opposed it in 1973.  Those in favour should not be annoyed that we may raise matters which are relevant because if we do not understand what others think, we may lose the referendum.  It is vital that, where there is a forum and an opportunity, the Minister&rsquo;s councillors and people stand up and be counted to make sure both sides are heard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some may argue that we should not have to do without a Commissioner for a time but it is only sensible to curtail the number of Commissioners who will deal with the relevant issues on behalf of the Union and that we still have the safeguard of the ministerial Councils to actually make the final decisions.  The same situation will be relevant to Germany, France and Britain as it is to Ireland or any of the other smaller nations.  Each nation will have a Commissioner for ten out of every 15 years regardless of its size.  This is reasonably fair in the light of the fact that when we first joined, the bigger countries had two Commissioners and we had one.</P>
        <P>There are many other good reasons.  I have heard that people genuinely believe we in the main Opposition party should use the opportunity to highlight the failures of the Government.  There are many who believe we should vote against the treaty but I believe the future of the European Union and Ireland&rsquo;s place at the centre of it is a vital national interest which must come first.</P>
        <P>I can understand the serious frustration of the farming community with the failure of the Government to reign in Commissioner Mandelson.  When I spoke on the issue of the WTO in the House, I did not specifically criticise the Minister but I criticise without apology the Government, from the Taoiseach down, for the failure to reign in Commissioner Mandelson.  We should remember that his activities are not the fault of the Lisbon treaty but of the Taoiseach, <Col N="487"/>the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at European level.  Even at this late stage they should use their influence to make sure that no deal happens or, if necessary, use the veto to stop it in its current form.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>In the words of my party leader Deputy Enda Kenny:</P>
        <P LI="1">Essentially this treaty&rsquo;s purpose is to reform the institutions and decision making processes of the Union to cater for a population of 500 million people in 27 member states and to prepare Europe for the many challenges it faces.  These include the growing economic power of nations like China, Russia and India.  Other global challenges like climate change, hunger and disease epidemics require Europe to speak with a coherent voice if our continent is to be effective in contributing to solutions of these problems.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I cannot help thinking of the state of the country and the economy before we committed ourselves to the European ideal.  Before 1973 we were tied to the British cheap food policy as we had no access to the European Union or support from it.  We had a very clear and fully manned border with Northern Ireland, where each time one crossed it, a card had to be stamped to allow a vehicle to remain.  It was equally important to have it stamped coming back out.</P>
        <P>Our entry into the European Union gave us the opportunity to expand our agricultural production under a reasonable guarantee of return for effort.  From a farming point of view, it gave us the opportunity to export live cattle to Egypt, Libya and many other areas.  Likewise, beef could be exported with the support of export refunds to many of these nations.  With all these European structures, we built a vibrant agricultural and food processing industry.  I make the point because I come from that background.</P>
        <P>On the other side, we received massive investment from the United States and other interested countries wanting to use Ireland as their gateway to the European Union.  Ireland became a nation in its own right, was recognised clearly for stability and an ability to negotiate at European level and took its place with all other nations, especially the United States.  In more recent times there has been a better relationship with our nearest neighbours, the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot help referring at this stage to Deputy Finian McGrath&rsquo;s comments on wars and so on.  One thinks about the two world wars in the last century to which the European Economic Community was set up in response.  I shall come back to this later, but that was some change.  Under changes brought about through different EU structures the Border with Northern Ireland, like all other borders, slowly but surely came to an end, and no other group can claim responsibility for that.  It came about because of involvement within the EU.  We can drive freely from one end of this island to the other with little awareness of being in a different jurisdiction other than that Northern Ireland still uses miles on its signposts and we use kilometres.</P>
        <P>It was the EU or, to be totally correct, the old EEC that first broke down the borders and the enmities brought about through two major wars and clearly the EU structures have continued to ensure that peace remains the first objective.  This initiative has now been extended to east Germany and eastern European countries and has played no small role in helping to bring about the peace and co-operation that we have on this island.</P>
        <P>When I first went to Brussels as chairman of the National Livestock Committee of the IFA in 1979, and subsequently followed in Mr. Joe Bruton&rsquo;s footsteps as Chairman of the European Committee for Beef and Veal, I quickly learned that Brussels and the European ideal was more about co-operation and compromise than trying to win by the benefit of a vote.</P><Col N="488"/>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty has resulted from that type of structure, where we debate the issues and come up with the best possible compromise and solution to serve the needs of 27 states.  I have no problem in agreeing with the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign that from the point of any individual or nation particular issues might be better, but this is not the way negotiations, consultations and comprise works.</P>
        <P>The Irish delegation from all sides put a major effort into the treaty.  I have no doubt it will streamline the workings of the Commission, the European Parliament and all other sectors.  I am not suggesting that I have read every word of the treaty, as others have claimed to do, but I have faith in my party&rsquo;s advisers and personnel who have studied the details in depth and I believe we will be allowed to retain our taxation measures as well as all the other benefits we have derived from the EU in the past.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Remember it was the Fine Gael-led Government with Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn as Minister for Finance, which negotiated the 12.5% corporation tax which has been so beneficial to our industrial growth.  I remember at that time it was clearly said that this benefit would not be allowed to continue.  It was used as an issue at the time of the last European referendum to the effect that if we voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; we would lose our tax status, and some of the same people are crying wolf again.  It is interesting to read the comments of some of our people who have studied this matter in depth and confirmed the legal situation.  Deputy Billy Timmins specifically referred to two judgments of the European Court of Justice which made it crystal clear that all fiscal provisions must be provided for on a unanimous legal basis.  In other words, Ireland can still veto any attempt at tax harmonisation and any argument to the contrary is completely false.  Ireland&rsquo;s ability to decide on corporate and income tax rates remains a matter for the Irish authorities alone.  That is clearly stated by experts in the legal and political areas.  It is farcical for people to try to make out, without any foundation, that they have all the answers and that Ireland will lose that benefit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I stated at the outset, it is not difficult to justify voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; just to get at the Government.  The Minister for Education and Science claimed she had to impose school water charges because of EU law but we in Fine Gael were able to prove otherwise.  The EU is interested in curtailing waste but not in imposing charges that are unnecessary.  Likewise, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food claimed she could not pay REPS because of the EU.  However, through one of her MEPs this story was quickly quashed and farmers received their payments.  Too often the Government has used the EU as a scapegoat for the imposition of red tape.  Once again, the EU is insisting that every government puts forward plans to reduce red tape by at least 25%.</P>
        <P>I have many good friends who for their own strong reasons believe that they should vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  They are sick of the arrogance of the Minister for Health and Children and her refusal to take control of the health service, while frontline staff are not being replaced and individual home help and home help packages are being refused &mdash; the list goes on.  I say to them, as I say to all others, that Europe is not at fault for our health problems.  It is not at fault for our transport problems.  If funding had been properly used we would no longer have these problems.</P>
        <P>We have gained a great deal in funding from Europe.  That may not be the case in the future because our economy is in much better shape than those of other counties who have just joined.  However, there is still significant funding coming through the CAP arrangements to farmers and through social funding, but more importantly being at the heart of Europe has much more benefits for Ireland than money can ever buy.  One has to be involved in the process at some level to be able to realise this.</P><Col N="489"/>
        <P>When I was a young man travel was not an option because of cost.  Through competition introduced by the EC &mdash; Commissioner Peter Sutherland had a good deal to do with it &mdash; people can now fly for as little as &euro;5 plus taxes.  This means that our school children can travel and get the opportunities that we never had.</P>
        <P>Deputy Finian McGrath had much to say about the transfer of powers to the EU.  Through the Cathaoirleach, I say to the Minister that the transfer of powers that worry me most is not within Europe but rather within this Government &mdash; for instance, the transfer of powers to the HSE, the NRA and all the other bodies that are no longer answerable to the D&aacute;il.  We can compare this to what the Lisbon treaty is doing.  The Lisbon treaty is insisting that before decisions are made they should come to the D&aacute;il, where the House will have the opportunity to discuss them and if necessary amend them, with the support of other countries.  Far be it from the Lisbon treaty to take powers from this House.  It will give powers back to it which I believe is long overdue.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that Deputy McGrath said he was very much inclined to ask questions about the treaty, and he asserts his right to do so.  I cannot help wondering why he did not ask many more questions before he insisted on joining up with the Government.  That is something Deputy McGrath must question himself on and he will get far more interesting answers to this than from questions about the integrity of the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>I refer to some of the problems the Government has, especially with the WTO.  The Government has a few more weeks to get its act together.  I do not believe that the farmer organisations will tell members to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but they are extremely worried and not without good cause.  If the present proposals are put in place the IFA figures show that 50,000 jobs will be lost in farming and 50,000 in agri-industry.  There is no Minister, or anyone else, who can say that the IFA figures are not correct.  It is important that this be dealt with as quickly as possible and that Commissioner Mandelson return to the previous agreement negotiated by the Government as the bottom line for the WTO talks.  If this does not happen, the Lisbon treaty will not really matter and there will be extremely serious consequences for the country.  I urge the Minster and his colleagues to ensure the treaty&rsquo;s ratification will not be affected by the WTO talks.  The only way he can do this is by dealing with the talks in a positive, structured way.  He should ensure European farmers, Irish farmers included, learn that Commissioner Mandelson is not the only person in charge of the European structures and that the Government is prepared to stand up to him to ensure the country does not suffer.</P>
        <P>It is Fine Gael policy to promote the treaty publicly.  My colleague, Deputy Creighton, has done tremendous work promoting it and has attended meetings in this regard.  She attended a well structured meeting in Ballybay, County Monaghan.  There was another in Cavan on Friday night.  We intend to hold meetings in all constituencies to ensure Fine Gael&rsquo;s support for the treaty is made known.</P>
        <P>Without fear of contradiction, I say to the Minister that unless his people are committed to promoting the treaty, it will not be ratified.  As I said to his colleague, not one member of his party spoke from the floor at a meeting in Monaghan town.  This is not the key to success in the referendum.  I am not sure whether Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was at the meeting I attended.  His supporters were present, as was Deputy Conlon and her supporters, to back up their case.  The Minister&rsquo;s supporters were not; if he wants to win the referendum on the treaty and remain at the centre of Europe, as I do, it is essential that his troops be on the ground.  It will be difficult for the Opposition to maintain its troops on the ground if it does not see the Government taking action.</P>

	<P>T&aacute;im ag iarraidh mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Broin as Contae na M&iacute;.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo sa D&aacute;il.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go nglacfar leis an gconradh um athch&oacute;iri&uacute; mar go gcreidim gurb &eacute; leas phobail na h&Eacute;ireann &eacute;.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address this subject in the D&aacute;il.  It is my hope the EU reform treaty will be passed because it is in the best interests of the people.</P>
        <P>Let me outline briefly some of the reasons the reform treaty should be accepted.  My reasoning will not be comprehensive due to time constraints.  A fundamental reason is that the treaty deals with the issue of informing national parliaments of proposed legislation.  This does away with the problem that arose when there was a sense that regulations were being passed in the European Union without national parliaments or the public being aware of their details.</P>
        <P>The provision for the equality of representation in the Commission is being preserved.  This protects our vital interests and ensures the parity of all nation states in the European Union.  Under the early treaties, the larger states had greater representation in the Commission but this will not be the case in the future.</P>
        <P>The pivotal role of the Council of Ministers is also consolidated by the reform treaty.  Again, this is in our vital national interest.  In Article 1.3, the treaty clearly sets out for the first time the aims of the European Union:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.  These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between men and women prevail.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is very important that the Union set out its stall in this way.  Article 1.3 plainly demonstrates its objective of advancing the well-being of the peoples of Europe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One provision in the reform treaty is of particular relevance to my work as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the work of my Department.  I have seen very little comment on this matter to date.  As the White Paper states, the treaty provides special recognition for areas that suffer from particular challenges, &ldquo;Among the regions concerned, particular attention should be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and areas which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps, such as the northernmost regions with very low population density, and island, cross-border, and mountain regions.&rdquo;  This very much mirrors the work of my Department in respect of urban areas experiencing industrial transition, rural areas, the islands and those areas facing physical or demographic handicaps.  I am delighted the treaty recognises there should be special treatment for these areas.  What is in the treaty very much mirrors all the Department&rsquo;s programmes such as RAPID and CL&Aacute;R and the commitment to the islands.</P>
        <P>The European Union is totally committed to rural development in its wider sense, in addition to being committed to agriculture.  The Union takes a wide view of rural development as total community development.  Within pillar 2 alone of the European rural development programme, &euro;2.4 billion is set aside for a range of rural development measures over the period 2007 to 2013.  My Department&rsquo;s new rural development programme will see an investment of almost &euro;1 billion, three times what it was previously, in measures to develop rural enterprise and quality of life through a combination of EU and State funding, matched by private sector resources, in the period to 2013.  Commissioner Fischer Boel has been particularly committed <Col N="491"/>to preserving and developing rural populations across Europe.  Everybody recognises this is a core policy of the Government.</P>

        <P>People in Ireland are justly proud of the role this country has played in peacekeeping since the early 1960s.  The proposed treaty clearly allows us to continue with our traditional international peacekeeping role.  This is further cemented by the provision in the Bill which specifically provides, as did the referendum Bill on the second Nice referendum, that Ireland cannot become involved in a common defence arrangement without further reference to the people by way of a referendum.</P>
        <P>The treaty is unique in one other way.  Thanks to the universal support of all Members and parties in the D&aacute;il &mdash; I include Fine Gael, represented today by Deputy Creighton, and also Sinn F&eacute;in, represented by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in &mdash; and due to the efforts of the Taoiseach since the last treaty was passed, the Irish language has become an official and working language of the European Union since 1 January 2007.  It has the full support of all other member states.  The reform treaty reflects this fact and is the first European Union treaty that recognises our national language on a par with all of the other official languages of the Union.  I am slightly disappointed that Sinn F&eacute;in cannot join us in supporting this momentous step forward where our language, in the immortal words of Robert Emmet, takes its place among the nations of the world.</P>

        <P Just="Left">A point was made on meetings and many have been held in the Meath East constituency.  It was suggested that Fianna F&aacute;il activists are not promoting the treaty but it is important to put on the record of the House that in my constituency and that of the Acting Chairman we are actively promoting it.  We have had a number of meetings and I will hold more public information meetings on the treaty.  We have started canvassing for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote and I would say we are one of the first parties to do so.  We were knocking on doors this weekend and it is not true to say that Fianna F&aacute;il activists are not working on the ground.  The party machine and our activists are more than happy to promote the treaty and give the information that is required.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is right that the D&aacute;il is spending considerable time debating this Bill, which seeks to amend the Constitution to give effect to the Lisbon treaty.  No doubt the Government and its allies in this House will cite the succession of TDs who have stood up to advocate a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote but it is important we recognise that the arguments of those of us who take the opposite view are no less important.</P>
        <P>Successive referenda have shown that people have been ill-served by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour, who have unquestioningly and uncritically supported every proposed development of the European Union that has been put to referendum in this State.  Yet consistently over one third of the electorate has opposed the further loss of sovereignty and the undermining of neutrality.  That section of opinion grew to defeat the first Nice referendum in 2001.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Now the number of voters who find themselves unrepresented or not properly represented in this House has increased.  Very many of those who voted for the Green Party, on the basis that they would oppose further erosion of Irish sovereignty and neutrality, find that their party has swung around to support the Lisbon treaty, not on its merits but so the party can remain in government with Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
        <P>Government speakers have repeatedly cited the positions we have taken in previous referenda and say that we are not to be trusted when we state that we are for continued EU membership, that co-operation with our EU partners is valuable and must continue and that we have supported EU measures that have benefited this country.  However, these are the positions of Sinn F&eacute;in.  We are positive about Europe, we are for critical engagement with the European Union and too many in this House are for unquestioning loyalty to EU institutions.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to hear them refer to previous referenda.  There was no referendum between the referendum on EU accession in 1972 and the referendum on the Singe European Act in 1987.  The gap was a full 15 years and if successive Governments, involving Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour, had had their way there would have been no referenda at all after accession. <Col N="494"/> The people were only given the right to decide on these issues after a private citizen, the late Mr. Raymond Crotty, took court action on constitutional grounds.  It is interesting to consider how far the political elite in this State would have taken us if they had not been held to account in this way.  For one thing, I very much doubt that we would have remained outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO.</P>
        <P>In his speech introducing this Bill the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said:</P>
        <P LI="1">There is currently no proposal for a common EU defence.  In any case, a change in Ireland&rsquo;s position can only come about if the Irish people decide so in a referendum.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Again we have the touching reference to a referendum.  The Minister&rsquo;s party, Fianna F&aacute;il, in its 1997 election manifesto, opposed membership of NATO&rsquo;s so-called Partnership for Peace.  That was the first general election that saw Deputy Bertie Ahern elected Taoiseach.  Deputy Bertie Ahern said that to join it without a referendum would be a &ldquo;serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic&rdquo;.  In government he joined it and there was no referendum.</P>
        <P>This State has come to play an increasingly significant role in both NATO and EU military structures.  Irish troops serve at NATO headquarters in Brussels under the so-called Partnership for Peace.  Irish troops have served in NATO-led missions, including in Afghanistan.  There is a full-time EU military staff, EUMS, headquartered in Brussels that is responsible for command and control of EU military capabilities.  This reports to an EU military committee which, in turn, reports to the EU Political and Security Committee and from thence upwards to the EU Council of Ministers.  Irish Army officers serve with the EUMS and Ireland is represented at all other levels of this network.  This Lisbon treaty will deepen involvement with NATO, ensuring that all such activities are compatible with NATO, while increasing Irish taxpayers&rsquo; contributions to Irish and EU military capabilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Government speaker after Government speaker, as well as others on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side, have repeatedly tried to promote the scare story that a rejection of Lisbon will see us turned into the dunces of the EU class who will be put standing in the corner or, worse still, expelled altogether.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, have specialised in this line.  Deputy Martin Mansergh tried to recruit every Irish patriot from Eoghan Rua &Oacute; Neill to Thomas Davis and the men and women of 1916 to the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign.  All this was to show that by voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; we would be turning our backs on Europe and the world.  It is patent and patronising nonsense and it convinces no one.</P>
        <P>France and the Netherlands rejected the EU constitution in 2005.  They did not lose influence or standing in the European Union and nor would this State if it did likewise.  The purpose of a referendum is for the citizens of a member state to freely and democratically decide on the matter at hand.  As democrats we must all, including our EU partners, respect the outcome of the referendum.  Attempts to bully or bribe us into voting a particular way are undemocratic.  There is no doubt that, if rejected, this treaty will reopen the debate about the future of Europe.</P>
        <P>The attempts by the political elite in Ireland and in Brussels to deceive the people have gone well beyond rhetoric here in the D&aacute;il and I want to detail some of it.  In October 2007 the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was due to produce a report on a common consolidated corporate tax base.  There were many in the Parliament who wanted the Commission to bring forward its proposal.  At the co-ordinators&rsquo; meeting Mr. Eoin Ryan, MEP, of Fianna F&aacute;il intervened to request that it be postponed until after the referendum here in Ireland.  Representatives of the political blocs to which Labour, Fine Gael and <Col N="495"/>Marian Harkin are affiliated all agreed to postpone it.  Again, this report will not now be discussed until after the Irish referendum.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In December 2007, European Commission President, Mr. Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, removed tax harmonisation from the strategic objectives of the Commission for 2008.  It was widely reported in both the Irish and European media that Irish Commissioner, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, campaigned for this change as he believed that the plans for the tax base would become an issue in the debate on the treaty referendum.  Following this decision, L&aacute;szl&oacute; Kov&aacute;cs, Commissioner for Taxation and Customs Union, told MEPs that same month that a legislative proposal for a common tax base would still be published but not until after the 2008 summer break &mdash; after the Irish referendum.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann,</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">concerned at the impact on patients and those dependent on the health service of continuing cutbacks, staff shortages and under-resourcing; and noting in particular:</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />that there are an estimated 10,000 people who acquire a brain injury in Ireland every year;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />that up to 2% of all people have disabling problems following an acquired brain injury, whether from traumatic brain injury, stroke or other causes;</P>

       <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />deplores the long waiting times that can see patients waiting up to two years for rehabilitative care;</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">calls for:</P>

        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />the immediate publication of the national review of neurology and clinical neurophysiology services;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />an increase in the number of approved posts for consultant neurologists from 24 to 42 and neurosurgeons from nine to 16;</P><Col N="496"/>
       <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />a significant increase in the number of rehabilitation consultants to reflect demand for these services; and</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />the provision of effective community rehabilitative and support services for post-medical ABI patients.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In putting down this motion, the Labour Party hopes this debate will have some impact on a much neglected area.  It is estimated that approximately 30 people a day suffer some kind of brain injury and a further 30 people suffer a stroke, which can also lead to brain injury.  It is also estimated that approximately 30,000 people have an ongoing disability due to brain injury.  Services are woefully inadequate to cope with these kinds of numbers; they are also inconsistent across the country.  The majority of services are provided by voluntary organisations, but all of them have waiting lists and they know they are only scratching the surface.</P>
        <P>Acquired brain injury, ABI, can happen at any time to anyone.  It can happen after a road accident, assault or other blow to the head, as well as after a stroke, infection, haemorrhage or cancer.  It means someone&rsquo;s life can change overnight, as well as that of their family and friends.  The impact can be lifelong.  It is not always obvious that someone has been affected, as the effects are not always physical, but can lead to memory, planning, emotional and behavioural problems.</P>
        <P>Many organisations are to the forefront of highlighting this situation such as Headway Ireland, Br&iacute; &mdash; the advocacy group for people with acquired brain injuries &mdash; Brainwave, the Irish Epilepsy Association and the Peter Bradley Foundation.  All claim there is a chronic shortage of beds for patients with acquired brain injuries and a complete lack of such beds in some regions.  With a serious head injury, immediate intervention is essential to ensure the person returns to normality, if normality can be achieved.</P>
        <P>It is conservatively estimated that there are 10,000 new brain injuries every year but there are just 110 beds to deal with these people.  This does not make sense at any level.  A recent report stated there are 20 neurologists when, given our population base, there should be 42.  We have nine neurosurgeons when we should have 16.  The Netherlands has 12 times the number of rehabilitation consultants per head of population than Ireland.  Approximately 700,000 people have a neurological condition and, because of the process of ageing and with people living longer, it is estimated there will be 800,000 in ten years&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>People with a brain injury may spend three years in a long-stay care bed.  However, if they were to receive the proper treatment and rehabilitation process, they could be up and about, returning to normality and looking after themselves.  This is where our resources should be invested because the impact a brain injury has on the individual and his or her family is immeasurable.  The cost of keeping someone in long-term care is equally immeasurable when that person could return to a productive life.</P>
        <P>Cork University Hospital has estimated an average 3,825 acute bed days are lost annually due to inadequate access to rehabilitation beds.  The recent Health Service Executive, HSE, document, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity Review: A Preferred Health System in Ireland to 2020, estimated the daily cost of an inpatient bed in a major teaching hospital as &euro;1,917, which implies the waste of &euro;7.7 million annually in that hospital alone due to inadequate access to rehabilitation beds.</P>
        <P>The annual cost of just two beds in Cork University Hospital, put beyond use due to cumulative discharge delays, is more expensive than a team consisting of one consultant, two occu<Col N="497"/>pational therapists, two physiotherapists, one speech and language therapist, one psychologist, one secretary and an equipped office.</P>
        <P>Rehabilitation has the potential to reduce long-term care costs and enhance prospects of return to work for affected patients.  Previous studies in other countries have demonstrated that rehabilitation services are cost effective and result in savings for the national economy in the long run.</P>
        <P>While optimally people who suffer brain injuries through trauma, illness or stroke should be treated in an hour, or at worst 24 hours, it is seldom the case.  Rather than waiting 24 hours, people wait 24 months or two years for treatment.  If that is not remarkable enough, some doctors are not referring patients who need rehabilitation services to a consultant because it is seen as a pointless exercise as waiting lists are endless.</P>
        <P>Anything beyond a two-week delay is unacceptable.  The tragic certainty that a sick person has to wait two years for an initial assessment is nothing short of abandonment of its obligation to the public by the HSE.  This is a sad commentary on our times.  The HSE has a national annual budget in excess of &euro;14 billion, a sum that would float some of the newer economies in the EU.  It should be giving us a much better service.</P>
        <P>This cannot be ignored and must be tackled.  Proposals have been made to deal with this problem but all have been ignored.  The stated intention to await the development of an overall strategy and action plan for the development of rehabilitation services is regularly given by HSE and the Department of Health and Children as the reason for not developing services at present.</P>
        <P>The action plan creates a false impression of ongoing progress in the development of services.  It was first proposed in 1997 in response to the report of the national advisory committee on medical rehabilitation.  Its alleged imminent arrival has been quoted in a multitude of reports since then, including health strategies, national partnership agreements and national development plans.</P>
        <P>This prolonged period of anticipation has had only one effect, that of preventing any development.  The stated need for a strategy as a prerequisite to any service development has resulted in the rejection of various proposals by health services and voluntary sector bodies.  It has delayed approval of capital funding for the redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  This approach based on figures from health services documents results in an estimated 1,600 new patients with neuro-disability being denied accessible rehabilitation services each year.  The plan is now mythical in status, frequently referred to in national partnership agreements and health service strategy documents.</P>
        <P>The development of a service that is fit for purpose requires the involvement of appropriately trained clinicians who are intimately aware of the extent of the problems and resources to implement any proposals.  Locally based expertise is necessary to identify local needs and propose realistic solutions.  More importantly, only locally based professionals can take ownership of the recommendations and commit to implementing them.</P>
        <P>In the absence of locally employed trained professionals, one has to rely on expert committees, the majority of whose members probably have no rehabilitation expertise.  Those who do could be based outside the region.  Many will be based in clinical areas, the needs of which will compete with rehabilitation services for scarce resources and funding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Even narrowly focused reviews take a long time to produce.  A current example is the recently published report of the committee to review neurosurgical services.  Neurosurgery is provided on two sites and has relatively few links to other specialties or disciplines.  Despite this narrow focus, it took five years to produce the report, having been commissioned in March <Col N="498"/>2002.  Given that rehabilitation services have a much more diverse role across all sectors of the health service, how long would it take to produce a comprehensive report on it?</P>
        <P>To manage this diversity, a review of rehabilitation services would be much more manageable if compartmentalised into priority areas.  Thus, individual focus groups with relevant expertise could deal with those aspects with which they are most involved.  For example, individual groups might focus on areas such as power wheelchair provision, amputee-limb deficiency rehabilitation, transition for disabled school leavers or services for multiple sclerosis patients, the experts recruited in each of these areas having different backgrounds depending on the focused topic.  The recently produced stroke review is an example of this type of focused approach, an example that should be used in respect of the sector under discussion.</P>
        <P>Our experience is probably the greatest argument against the action plan approach.  Previous action plans, such as those developed by the former health boards, have been ignored.  The report of the national advisory committee on medical rehabilitation has been largely ignored, the national action plan being one of the few recommendations that attracted the Department&rsquo;s attention.  Those recommendations that required action were set aside.  The appointment of regional teams with specialist expertise and the development of regional planning were core recommendations, but they were dropped.  The national action plan has failed to materialise after ten years of planning stagnation.  The HSE has been in existence for three years and has not managed to progress the plan.  This lack of progress is not due to neglect on anyone&rsquo;s part, but it is an inevitable consequence of an unrealistic approach.  However, to persist further with a failed strategy would be difficult to justify.</P>
        <P>Most new services arise when a clinician or manager in an existing service identifies a local need.  Following a period of advocacy and negotiation, the need is usually addressed through a service that starts out as a subdivision of the parent organisation.  Several specialties and therapy disciplines in the HSE south region have identified this need in respect of rehabilitation, but none has the capacity to provide it from existing resources.  The only comparable Irish model for this dilemma is that of palliative care, which started with an approach of developing specialist teams in each region and evolved into an inpatient service, at which stage the 2001 strategy document Design Guidelines for Specialist Palliative Care Settings was produced.  This action plan was able to be produced having the twin benefits of relevant input and a limited focus based on identified needs.</P>
        <P>In all other developed countries, rehabilitation services have evolved from within other services through one of a number of routes, those being progression of the role of community-based rehabilitation teams and extension of services from within other specialties, such as rheumatology, geriatric medicine and neurology.  We should remember that there is no model whereby an entire regional service has been developed in a single operation.  For example, it is universally acknowledged that there is an overwhelming need for a regional rehabilitation service based in Cork, nor is there any doubt that initial emphasis for this service would be to provide neurorehabilitation for patients of working age with brain injury, stroke and progressive neurological disorders.</P>
        <P>It is equally uncontroversial to state that any rehabilitation team appointed would need to include relevant expertise drawn from rehabilitation medicine, rehabilitation nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and psychology.  Based on experience elsewhere, there is no option but to consider that this team will need to be outpatient-based initially as the design of any inpatient unit should be strongly influenced by the team that will want to make the most efficient use of it.  I am conscious of the time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need for an action plan to come up with these self-evident conclusions.  To persist in an elusive quest for an all-embracing strategy rather than taking pragmatic steps to address current unmet needs is a compassionless bureaucratic approach that values process over outcome.  Often, neurorehabilitation requires prolonged hospital admissions and-or repeated outpatient management.  Reintegration into one&rsquo;s own environment and community is integral to the role of rehabilitation medicine and requires close links between the discharging hospital and the primary care team.</P>
        <P>It defies logic to suggest that removing patients who have a combination of cognitive, emotional, behavioural and physical impairments to a location that is at least two hours from their homes, families and communities is in their interest.</P>

	<P>Given that health service estimates suggest a prevalence of almost 20,000 patients aged 16 to 65 years with a disability secondary to brain injury, stroke or progressive neurological disease in the HSE south and west areas and an annual incidence of new cases of 3,000, this is not or should not be seen as a niche specialty.</P>
        <P>Not only is there a need for services in Cork, but also in Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Kilkenny and the north west as well as probable satellite services in Kerry and Mayo.  A start in Cork would address the greatest need for those beyond the Pale and would provide a pilot for further development.</P>
        <P>The population of Massachusetts is 6.3 million and it has 14 rehabilitation units and 19 specialists per million of population.  Germany, with a population of 82 million, has 120 rehabilitation units and 30 specialists per million of population.  Romania, one of our poorer neighbours, with a population of 22 million, has 32 specialists per million of population.  The Republic of Ireland, with a population of 4.2 million, has one rehabilitation unit and 1.4 specialists per million of population.  Ours is the only western European state larger than Luxembourg in which rehabilitation services are centralised in one city.</P>
        <P>The British Society of Rehabilitation Medicine estimates that approximately 60 beds per million of population are required for the rehabilitation of under 65 year olds with acquired brain injury and that units should ideally be based on populations of 1 million to 3 million.  This would mean 240 beds in Ireland.  As a minimum and allowing for population dispersal, there should be units in Cork and Galway with links to less specialised slower stream rehabilitation units in other population centres.</P>
        <P>The social and personal effects of acquired brain injury are a loss of income, which is self-evident, a loss of relationships with loved ones due to personality changes, which we do not always consider, and a high incidence of marital breakdown, of which we do not hear much.  When we consider why acquired brain injury has not been part and parcel of our major concerns through the years, we must think about certain issues, namely, those that affect the people in question.  Our caring community is stressed and does not have the energy to make its case.  In addition to this, people are desperately worried that their concerns might be seen as a criticism of their service provider, the only one they have, and that should not be the case.</P>
        <P>We must take into consideration that delays cause distress and a loss of dignity, not just for the affected patients and their carers but also for those who are unable to gain admission to the hospital beds they occupy.  A hospital bed in Cork University Hospital costs &euro;1,919 per night or approximately &euro;700,000 per annum.  In February 2007 in the neurosurgical ward alone, six beds were occupied by patients awaiting transfer to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in <Col N="500"/>D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  This number is not atypical.  The same circumstances prevailed across all the other acute wards in all the hospitals in HSE south.</P>
        <P>While I am anxious to allow my colleagues to contribute, I will ask one question of the Minister before concluding.  Which would cost the HSE more &mdash; the annual cost of two beds in Cork University Hospital that are put beyond use due to cumulative discharge delays or a team consisting of one consultant, two occupational therapists, two physiotherapists, one speech and language therapist, one psychologist, one secretary and a fully equipped office?  Which would have a more direct benefit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for tabling a motion that sets out a highly comprehensive case on behalf of the Labour Party and for giving me some of her allocated time.  I also welcome the many people present in the Gallery this evening, many of whom have direct experience of the issues under discussion.  Representatives are present from such organisations as Headway Ireland, Br&iacute;, Brainwave, the Peter Bradley Foundation and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, as well as ordinary families who have been hurt by acquired brain injury in a variety of ways.  I refer to those who have directly experienced such a brain injury, as well as their nearest and dearest.  The Labour Party Members hope that by proposing this motion tonight, they will be able to make a difference with regard to their experience and lives.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that this debate is taking place at a time when one hears of cutbacks throughout the services provided by the HSE.  One reason the Labour Members have used their scarce Private Members&rsquo; time on this issue is that sometimes, in a time of cutbacks, such groups are left aside and their voices are not always heard in the clamour for resources.  The Labour Party Members wish to ensure that those who have acquired brain injuries and their families are not left behind at a time when one hears of cutbacks throughout the service.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that one hears of the long-needed development of service being abandoned, simply to keep the service going without any changes in the manner in which it is run.  Unfortunately, this is a real concern.  Deputy Kathleen Lynch is correct that we know what must be done and where are the gaps in service and waiting lists.  Waiting lists exist throughout the services for people with acquired brain injuries.  For example, a two-year waiting list is in place for neurology services, which is appalling.  I understand that although a neurology report has been available since December 2007, it still has not been published.  Tonight I call for the report&rsquo;s publication and implementation because a two-year waiting list for neurology services is completely unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Waiting lists obtain throughout the service in Ireland, which lacks the kind of linkages and automatic progression that should be present.  Those who have worked in such services in other countries can give examples of what happens when someone is admitted to an accident and emergency unit with a brain injury after a serious traffic accident.  Such people are dealt with in the accident and emergency unit and thereafter, if necessary, are dealt with by a neurosurgeon.  Subsequently they move onto rehabilitation, which is followed by a move to community services.  There is linkage of, and a seamless flow to, the services and there is no delay.  In respect of acquired brain injuries, Members know how important it is to provide the service as quickly as possible to the person concerned.  A couple of hours can make an enormous difference in respect of a traumatically acquired brain injury, perhaps through a road accident, to someone who suffers a stroke or to someone who acquires an brain injury in another fashion.  Such an immediate reaction can make life-transforming differences for the people affected.  However, this does not happen because we lack the services that people need.</P><Col N="501"/>
        <P>This would be money extremely well-spent.  Those who can benefit from the required interventions at an early stage, such as those who, for example, can get a bed in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire when they need it, enjoy a better quality of life and much greater opportunities to participate fully in their community, return to work or to avoid needing long-term services.   Regardless of whether one balances this issue in respect of quality of life, which is much more important, or discusses the cost of the services, the provision of such services when they are needed for the people who need them constitutes a win-win outcome either way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Kathleen Lynch has outlined the Irish statistics whereby approximately 10,000 people per year suffer an acquired brain injury, as well as the absolute inadequacy of having only 110 beds for those people.  Quite detailed studies have been carried out in this regard.  For example, a study was carried out in the Glasgow area on behalf of the<i> British Medical Journal</i> that indicated the potential throughput and results that can be and were achieved when a proper service is provided.  A Royal College of Surgeons of England working party produced a report in 1999 that outlined the processes that were needed.  This is the kind of strategy to which Deputy Lynch has referred.  However, they put it in place in 1999 and are implementing it and providing such a service at present.  The Labour Party Members call for the service to be provided without being obliged to wait.  While they certainly would welcome a national strategy, provision of a service should not be obliged to wait for the development of a national strategy that may take place well into the future.</P>
        <P>In particular, I wish to discuss the services that are required in the community and the motion calls for a series of regionally-based services.  Practically every family in Ireland has experience of what it is like when a family member acquires a brain injury.  It affects the whole family.  Courses are held in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire for family members who are dealing with a loved one&rsquo;s acquired brain injury.  However, as the courses are held in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the affected families are obliged to travel there to attend them.</P>
        <P>I spoke to someone today who has a family member who recently acquired a brain injury.  Such people talk about the various important services and of the cost to families at times of being obliged to travel to such services, or of being obliged to access them in the private sector when such services are unavailable in the public sector.  In the brief time available to me, I wish to quote from a document that outlines one particular experience.  The person concerned is a young man who was injured in a road traffic accident:</P>
        <P LI="1">[He] was without physiotherapy for 9 months in 2006-7 and the physiotherapist has over 200 clients &mdash; now how could she deliver any service to each person on her case load.  The same with the occupational therapist.  He is unable to deliver the type of service that would be appropriate for a person with [acquired brain injury] and he has over 200 clients also.  If a clinician is on leave or leaves the service, there is no plan for backup and there is no one to fill in so the clients are just abandoned.</P>
        <P LI="1">There is no psychologist in the service and even if there was it would be the same thing &mdash; over 200 clients in the service waiting for services.  They have not had a psychologist for over 3 years and the psychologist assigned to work sessionally with him had no idea how to work with a person with ABI and has now left due to illness.  He has had an hour a week of psychology (privately provided by the HSE) by a psychologist who works part time for the HSE and part time privately providing services (to the HSE).  He is not part of the multi disciplinary team and is not engaged with programme planning, staff training, etc. etc. as recommended.  The HSE does not have medical expertise available to this service nor does it have brain injury expertise as recommended.  There is no vocational or day service in the <Col N="502"/>area specifically for people with brain injury and no support or outreach service and no emergency services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">All Members are familiar with the enormous obstacles that those who have an acquired brain injury must overcome.  Lately, I have been involved with a pilot programme for Headway in my native city on a group that oversees the programme, together with representatives of F&Aacute;S, the VEC, the HSE, etc.  I have been enormously impressed by the work done by organisations such as Headway and the others.  A great deal of voluntary effort takes place, as do enormous efforts by those who possess acquired brain injuries.  They must put a great deal of work into their own recovery.  The State must respond to their needs and one cannot simply allow the service be as minuscule as is the case at present.  Although Deputy Lynch referred to the amount of money that has been invested in the health services, other countries appear to be able to implement such services and to be able to respond to the needs that exist.  We also must do so.</P>
        <P>I also wish to refer to one or two matters because I tried to consult with and talk to as many people as possible.  Some of the specific issues that people raised include memory assisting technology, which costs &euro;2,000 per person, card recognition, which allows someone to present a card that outlines his or her brain injury, and the failure of disabled driver VRT to cater for the needs of people with acquired brain injuries.  Compulsory motorbike helmets were also recommended.  I have a list of issues, the most important of which is the need for a full service that can support people with acquired brain injuries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support this motion and welcome its identification of the devastating effects of current HSE cutbacks and, in particular, its focus on the massive gaps in the provision of neurology services in this State.  The motion speaks at the outset of the impact of cuts and staff shortages on patients in general.  Given that the Minister for Health and Children is here, I have to note the outrage that is growing daily throughout the country at the cutbacks being imposed by the HSE and its policy of destroying the services provided in local hospitals. </P>
        <P>Yesterday I revealed the internal HSE plan to impose a sentence of death on Monaghan General Hospital and a sentence of hard labour on Cavan General Hospital.  Under this Taoiseach and the Minister, the HSE plans to close 50 acute inpatient beds and six critical care beds in Monaghan by the end of November.  In one fell stroke Monaghan will be denied the ability to care for 3,000 acute inpatient admissions per annum.  Those admissions will have to be dealt with by Cavan, which already has 5,000 inpatient admissions per annum and 160% bed occupancy.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, are discussing the issues I am addressing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is to be done without a single additional bed being provided in Cavan.  The HSE&rsquo;s plan is fraudulent in the extreme.  It claims that the net loss of 56 hospital beds in Cavan and Monaghan and the north-east region will be compensated for by greater provision of non-acute care, rehabilitation, step-down beds and respite care, but these are the services that are being slashed by the HSE in its current wave of cutbacks.  It is closing a 12-bed respite unit in St. Oliver Plunkett Hospital in Dundalk.  That is being replicated across the country, notably in respect of the 12 respite beds being cut in Cherry Orchard Hospital in Dublin. </P><Col N="503"/>
        <P>I warn the Minister and her colleagues that the death threat to Monaghan General Hospital will be resisted.  We will not allow a hospital that has served our community for generations to be destroyed by this Government.  She can be sure this is not the last she will hear of this.  People throughout the country should take note of the template she intends visiting on other local hospitals.  Shame on the Minister and the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>Turning to the main substance of the motion, I commend the Labour Deputies on highlighting neurological needs.  The huge gaps in the provision of neurological services in Ireland were identified by an expert panel, together with the Neurological Association of Ireland, in three standards of care documents published between 1999 and 2002 and a series of far-reaching recommendations were generated.  These identified a number of problems regarding neurological services, including: long waiting times for initial diagnosis and follow up due to a chronic shortage of neurologists; lack of resources for provision of multidisciplinary care needed by those with neurological conditions, palliative and respite care and co-ordinated follow up in the community; and problems in accessing transport, health care, employment and information about their condition for those with neurological conditions.  The documents make a series of recommendations which focus on changes in the health sector to meet the needs of those with neurological conditions, as well as the wider issues of access to information, support, employment and transport.  As the motion makes clear, however, progress on these vital recommendations has been minimal.</P>
        <P>In January 2006, after an inquest on a woman who died during an operation in Beaumont Hospital&rsquo;s neurosurgery centre, Professor Ciar&aacute;n Bolger, head of research and development in neurosurgery at Beaumont and head of clinical neurosurgery at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, spoke out.  He stated that approximately 200 patients throughout the country were on an urgent waiting list for a bed at the national neurosurgery centre in Beaumont.  The condition of ten of those patients was life-threatening.  He also stated that the computer guide system in the operating theatre had broken down during five of the last six neurosurgery procedures which he had carried out in Beaumont.  While this made the operations more difficult, the procedures had to continue.  According to the professor, various other machines used in the clinic also regularly break down.  That happened under the Minister&rsquo;s watch.  The buck stops with her for health care and no amount of buck passing to the HSE will exonerate her from responsibility for these matters.</P>
        <P>There has been no increase in the number of neurosurgeons working in the health service in 25 years, despite a dramatic increase in the population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the Minister, Deputy Devins, repeats his claim, I remind him that fewer neurosurgery operating slots are available now than 25 years ago.  He should chew on that for a minute.  In 2006, 1,000 non-urgent patients were on a waiting list for a bed at the neurosurgery centre.  Cork University Hospital is the only other hospital in the State with a neurosurgery department but it is limited by staffing and medical equipment in what it can do.  Professor Bolger has described the national neurosurgery service as a mess.  He stated that we have nine neurosurgeon consultants in Ireland, six in Beaumont and three in Cork, but if we were in line with the UK, which has the lowest in Europe, we would have 16 based on our population and by US and continental Europe standards we should have 20 to 30.</P>
        <P>Promises to improve neurosurgery services have repeatedly been broken.  At Beaumont, priority is given to making space for one of the Government&rsquo;s precious private-for-profit hospitals on a co-located site.  The long promised psychiatric unit at Beaumont is again to be <Col N="504"/>deferred because the private hospital that the Minister cherishes is to be located on the site earmarked for this vital facility.</P>
        <P>Many issues have arisen in respect of this State&rsquo;s health delivery systems.  They are complex and a mighty effort will be required to correct them, yet there is no intent on the part of the Minister and her colleagues to address them in the interests of ordinary people who depend on our public health system.  This motion identifies one area of pressing need in health care.  There are many others and we are all equally affected.  At any given time, the needs of neurosurgeons and all of the other related support staff could be our need also.  Let no one in the Chamber forget this.  The real pain and hardship caused by the Government&rsquo;s failure in its health delivery responsibilities are again exposed here today.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, it is a shame on the Minister and her colleagues.  I join in the demand for justice for patients requiring neurological services in this State.  As a first reaction, the Minister might consider wrapping up her position as Minister and joining the outgoing Taoiseach as he makes his way out of that role and responsibility in the coming days.  It is time to say <i>adieu</i>.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity this debate provides to put on the record of the House the Government&rsquo;s commitment and plans for rehabilitation and other services.  There will always be new health services we will want to provide faster, and in better facilities.  Advances in medical science alone will ensure that.  As a people, I have no doubt we will also strive for constant improvement in the services we can provide in our communities within what we can afford.</P>
        <P>I believe that a reasonable foundation for a health policy debate will recognise three things: first, the work and effort put in by all staff &mdash; clinical, management and administration &mdash; to provide and build up existing services, and the resulting improvements in health status for the Irish people that are actually being achieved; second, the real and substantial funding increases that have been provided by taxpayers in recent years, to the level of &euro;15 billion this year for the HSE, paying for 110,000 whole-time equivalent staff; and third, the need to ensure maximum efficiency in the use of resources so the highest level of services can be delivered for a given level of funding, so that good plans are developed and implemented and priorities within set budgets are achieved.  These considerations are as relevant for the development of rehabilitation services as every other part of the health service.</P>
        <P>The motion before us refers to the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  The hospital is currently a 120-bed hospital which provides treatment and rehabilitation for patients with spinal cord injuries, head injuries, amputation, traumatic and non-traumatic brain injury, strokes and neurological disorders.  The allocation for the National Rehabilitation Hospital is nearly &euro;30 million.  It also provides assessments for wheelchair and mobility aids and vocational training programmes involving a wide range of social, personal and work related skills.  The hospital also has a 12-bed hostel which enables patients from outside the Dublin area to access day services at the hospital and attend the vocational training unit.</P>
        <P>A new rehabilitation hospital is part of the national development plan.  When built, the new hospital will provide additional treatment and diagnostic capacity.  A project team is now working with an appointed design team to develop the new hospital.  The design will be submitted for planning later this year with a target completion date for the hospital of 2012.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health Service Executive has also informed me that plans have been prepared to develop a satellite unit of the National Rehabilitation Hospital attached to Beaumont Hospital, linking the rehabilitation expertise of the national hospital with the neurological services in Beaumont.  This new proposed unit will provide acute medical rehabilitation services and early rehabilitation for those suffering from brain injury who access the national neurosciences unit at Beaumont Hospital and who currently have to access services at the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  In addition, I understand that plans have been prepared in some regional areas for rehabilitation facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very vague.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Rehabilitation is a core element of health services.  It is fundamentally about enabling and supporting individuals to recover or adjust during this time, achieve their full potential and, where possible, to live full and active lives.  Increased trauma survival, especially in the area of stroke, road traffic accidents and occupational accidents, has increased the need for rehabilitation.  An increase in life expectancy has also affected the rehabilitative <Col N="507"/>needs of the population.  There is an increased awareness of the importance of rehabilitation especially in the areas of stroke and acquired brain injury.</P>
        <P>Key aspects of rehabilitation services are meeting the needs of older people, those with an acquired brain injury and those with multiple long-term conditions who wish to live independently in their own homes.  We need to improve interdisciplinary co-ordination of service delivery.  In addition, we need to improve access and availability.  The transition between services provided in hospital and the community requires to be considered also.  These are all matters that will be enabled by our reform programme, particularly the new consultants&rsquo; contract.</P>
        <P>Over the past ten years a number of former health boards and, more recently, HSE regions have commissioned local reports and research in recognition of the complexity of needs presented by people with acquired brain injury and the challenge of meeting those needs.  These reports indicate the need for a national strategic approach to planning and delivering rehabilitation services.  This need has been recognised by Government and social partners in the partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>The Government is also committed in our programme to increasing rehabilitation bed capacity.  My Department, together with the HSE, is committed to developing a strategy for the future of rehabilitation services, including a network of rehabilitation facilities.  A working group is being established to define the scope of rehabilitation services, research best practice approaches to rehabilitation services, assess the needs of the population and outline a model of service delivery that will encompass all stages of service required to meet the needs.</P>
        <P>The HSE has recently conducted a national review of neurology and clinical neurophysiology services.  The review was undertaken in view of the increasing demand for services along with the rapid pace of technological advances.  The review was overseen by a multidisciplinary steering group whose aim was to identify the current level of service provision and future requirements for neurology and neurophysiology services in Ireland.  The objectives were to evaluate current neurology services, including paediatrics and neurophysiology; review the evidence in regard to models of service delivery; identify requirements for the development of neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and prioritise service requirements; and to report to the director of the National Hospitals Office.  The HSE has advised my Department that work on the review has recently been completed and that the final draft report has been submitted to the director of the National Hospitals Office for consideration.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the need to develop neurology and neurophysiology services, additional revenue funding of &euro;3 million was allocated to the HSE in 2006.  In 2007 further additional revenue of &euro;4 million was allocated to support the continuing development of services in the area of neurosciences.  The HSE has advised me that there has been an increase in the number of consultant neurology posts arising from this investment.  In the area of neurology there are currently 24 approved posts of consultant neurologist in Ireland, of which 19 are filled.  With the current recruitment, the remainder will be filled.  This is an increase of ten approved posts since the Comhairle report in 2003.  Three such posts were advertised last week.  In addition, there are currently seven approved posts of consultant clinical neurophysiologist, of which four are filled.  This is an increase of four since the Comhairle report.</P>
        <P>The Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al report on neurosurgery recommended that the future development of safe, high quality neurosurgical services in Ireland would be best served by increasing capacity in Dublin and Cork and by improving access to neurosurgical units, including improved transport and telemedicine facilities for referring hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a very disappointing report for the west.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="508"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have met the doctors in the west but we need to develop what we have first.  The report identified a need for additional investment in neurosurgical services and the planning and commissioning of such services on a national basis.  The Health Service Executive has invested in the expansion of the service at Beaumont Hospital in recent years.   For example, in 2006 additional funding of &euro;800,000 was allocated to the hospital to address identified service requirements. In 2007 additional revenue development funding of &euro;4 million was allocated to the HSE to progress the further development of neuroscience services nationally.  The executive allocated an additional &euro;1 million in service development funding in 2007 to enable the hospital to make further improvements to its neurosurgical service.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in should be aware that currently there are 11 neurosurgeons in Ireland, not nine.  This funding has allowed for additional staff to be put in place, including a temporary consultant neurosurgeon and a specialist registrar in neurosurgery.</P>
        <P>This year Beaumont Hospital has been allocated a further &euro;1 million within its overall allocation to support the continued development of neurosurgery.  For example, in addition to the revenue investment, capital funding of nearly &euro;5 million was allocated to the hospital in 2007 for replacement equipment for the neurosurgery theatres, refurbishment of interventional radiology rooms, investment in intra-operative monitoring equipment, investment in image linkages and a database to improve reporting arrangements.  The 2007 capital allocation builds on the investment made in 2006.  The commissioning of the 11th theatre is under way.  This new theatre is capable of being commissioned on a 2.5 day basis in the near future, subject to recruiting an additional three staff, which was approved last year.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that &euro;900,000 in additional revenue funding was provided in 2007 to further develop neurosurgical services at Cork University Hospital, including the creation of a fourth neurosurgeon post.  The progressing of this development was tied up with the finalisation of the new consultants&rsquo; contract.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive and statutory agencies such as Headway, the Peter Bradley Foundation, the Irish Wheelchair Association and BRI are involved in providing support by way of service provision, family support advocacy or peer support for people with acquired brain injury.  The need is to support the person with acquired brain injury and his or her family.  Families have shown extraordinary support for their loved ones with brain injuries and the health service has a challenge to respond to them in kind.  On discharge from hospital, a range of services are provided for people with acquired brain injury and their families by both statutory and non-statutory agencies.  Headway, for example, provides rehabilitative training and occupational day services at a number of locations.  Support is also available for those seeking employment.  It also provides family support, psychology and counselling services, as well as a community access programme in counties Cork and Kerry.  Its information service provides a range of information leaflets on acquired brain injury related issues, books and a quarterly newsletter.</P>
        <P>The Peter Bradley Foundation has developed a range of community based local services which include assisted living, outreach community rehabilitation services, clinical support teams and case management services.  I acknowledge the need for acquired brain injury specific services due to the highly individualised nature of the disability being addressed.  The Health Service Executive now has a greater awareness and is developing a more integrated multi-disciplinary approach to acquired brain injury involving acute hospital services and primary and community care.  It acknowledges the need for facilities that are age appropriate and appropriate for people with acquired brain injury.</P>
        <P>The national disability strategy supports the goal of every individual resuming independent living where possible through assisted living services and housing provision.  The Health Service <Col N="509"/>Executive and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are acting with social housing agencies to address these needs.</P>
        <P>This debate provides a useful opportunity to highlight the Government&rsquo;s commitments and plans regarding rehabilitation and other services.  The Government will continue to invest and lead reform to ensure taxpayers&rsquo; resources are directed most efficiently towards building the new services we all desire.</P>

	<P>I am happy to avail of the opportunity this debate provides to clearly outline the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing a high quality rehabilitation service for all people with acquired brain injury, as well as disability services generally.  As we are all aware, an acquired brain injury can occur at any time as a result of an accident, assault, fall, brain haemorrhage or viral infection.  Each injury is unique and those more seriously affected may suffer from severe memory problems, personality changes and chronic fatigue which can be devastating for both the individual concerned and his or her family.</P>

        <P>I recognise the importance of effective rehabilitation to those who have suffered a stroke or brain injury.  I will outline the main steps taken to improve rehabilitation services but I first want to mention the recent establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health which will make a significant contribution to the improvement of rehabilitation services, as well as disability services generally.  In January the Government announced the establishment of the office to support me as the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and mental health services in exercising my responsibilities across four Departments: Health and Children, Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The new office brings together responsibility for a range of policy areas and State services which directly impact on the lives of people with a disability and mental health issues.  It aims to bring about improvements in the manner in which services respond to the needs of people with disabilities and mental health issues by working to develop person-centred services, focusing on the holistic needs of clients and service users and actively involving them in their own care.</P>
        <P>Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the areas of disability and mental health but much remains to be done.  In particular, there is a need to improve co-ordination and communication across Departments and agencies in their delivery of services to this client group.  That will be the main focus for the new office.  In addition, the development of a national rehabilitation strategy, which I will outline, will be among the key priorities for the office in the months to come.  The director of the office is a member of the senior officials group on social inclusion which monitors progress on the Government&rsquo;s commitments regarding social policy, including commitments made in the national disability strategy.  The Government has agreed that meetings will be held on a quarterly basis between the four Secretaries General of the relevant Departments, the director of the new office and me to review progress in the priority areas.</P><Col N="510"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decision to establish the Office for Disability and Mental Health reflects our commitment to developing a more coherent and integrated response to the needs of people with disabilities and mental health issues.  It recognises that clients and service users must be at the centre of service delivery and that we may need to examine the way services are delivered to ensure that is and will remain the case.  To effectively achieve this requires a cross-departmental, cross-agency response.  I was happy to be informed that representatives from some of the main voluntary organisations working in this area were present this evening to listen to the debate and was delighted to meet with most of them in the past few months.</P>
        <P>With the establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health and the associated attempts by the Government to get the relevant Departments and agencies to work together in a way that will ensure better results for services users, I consider this to be an excellent opportunity to raise the issue of the way voluntary bodies work together.  There are a number of excellent organisations striving to achieve similar goals in the area of brain injury and there is significant scope for a merger or alliance between them.  The key benefits would be an improved and more integrated service delivery to clients, a stronger, more united voice for service users and last, but not least, a significant reduction in the operating costs involved.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s objective in the coming years is to move the disability agenda to a level which matches that in any other country.  We aim to achieve this objective in partnership with all stakeholders, thereby maximising the use of all our resources to promote the full involvement of people with disabilities in the social, economic, political and cultural life of Ireland.  The Disability Act is a central element in that process.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework for delivering services to people with disabilities, places obligations on State organisations to make buildings and services accessible to people with disabilities, provides for sectoral plans in key service areas which requires public bodies to take positive actions to employ people with disabilities and provides for the establishment of a centre for excellence in universal design.  The Act is underpinned by the multiannual investment programme which was announced as part of the 2005 budget.  This programme will provide &euro;900 million for services for people with a disability between the years 2006 and 2009.  This funding will help to build the additional capacity required to put in place the framework set out in the Disability Act.  As part of the multiannual investment programme under the disability strategy, the Government provided the Health Service Executive with an additional &euro;75 million in both 2006 and 2007.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">This funding included moneys to provide new and enhanced services for people with disabilities.  The Government has also committed to a further &euro;50 million investment in services for people with a disability, as was announced in the budget for 2008.  Some examples of the huge investment in health and personal social services being provided under this programme include 8,800 people with a disability receiving care in residential places, with more people living in group homes within their communities than in residential centres.  There are 7,200 residential places providing respite care for people with a disability.  I was delighted last Friday to open a new respite care centre in Tullaghan in County Donegal for counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo.  Some 30,000 people with a disability are attending day services and there have been 3 million hours of personal assistance and home supports for people with a physical or sensory disability.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>Of course these are more than just statistics.  Each one of these hours, and every one of these residential and respite places, are making an important contribution to improving the lives of individuals with disabilities and their families.  The national intellectual disability database annual report for 2007 states that 97% of the people registered with the database are in receipt of a service.  The report goes on to state there has been significant growth in the level of <Col N="511"/>provision of services to people with an intellectual disability, which reflects the success of the Government&rsquo;s investment programme.</P>
        <P>A key initiative in the area of rehabilitation is the commitment by the Department of Health and Children and the HSE to the development of a national strategy for the provision of medical rehabilitation services.  A number of issues will be considered as part of this, including an assessment of the need, the structure and location of facilities and services and the nature of the rehabilitation facilities, that is, whether they should be hospital type, step down or preparation for independent living.</P>
        <P>Neurosurgery plays a key role in the rehabilitative process for many individuals with acquired brain injury.  The Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al report on neurosurgery from 2006 recommended the future development of safe, high quality neurosurgical services in Ireland would be best served by increasing capacity in Dublin and Cork and by improving access to neurosurgical units, including improved transport and telemedicine facilities for referring hospitals.</P>
        <P>The report identified a need for additional investment in neurosurgical services and in the planning and commissioning of such services on a national basis.  The Health Service Executive has invested in the expansion of the service at Beaumont Hospital over the past number of years, and the Minister has outlined this investment.</P>
        <P>The Government has recognised the need for the development of improved services for those with acquired brain injury.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and I welcome the initiative of the Labour Party to introduce it.</P><Col N="512"/>
        <P>In the 2001 health strategy, the Government promised to prepare an action plan for rehabilitation services for people with brain injury, recognising the shortage of inpatient and community-based services.  The action plan was supposed to set out a programme to meet existing shortfalls in speech and language services, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.</P>
        <P>Experts recommend that patients with a brain injury must be seen within two weeks to maximise recovery but Irish patients must wait up to two years for an initial assessment because we only have one rehabilitative hospital with 110 beds.  That has only the capacity to treat about a quarter of the 10,000 people who suffer a brain injury each year.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the Disability Act was promoted strongly and debated by my colleague, Deputy Stanton.  This Act promised an independent assessment of needs for all people with a neurological condition.  At the moment this is being rolled out to all children under the age of five but anyone over that age is not being assessed.</P>
        <P>The HSE strategic review of neurology and clinical neurophysiology services was due to be published in February 2007.  That review was given to the HSE last December but has still not been published.  Why is this so and why can it not be debated?  It is unacceptable that people suffering from brain injuries as a result of a car crash, stroke or other accidents or illnesses must wait as long as two years for rehabilitation services.</P>
        <P>Access to early rehabilitative treatment is critical for helping people to talk or walk again.  Although the health budget has never been larger, accessing services such as speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy has not improved.  As a result of long waiting lists, patients are left in debilitating conditions, dependent on others at home or in nursing homes for the rest of their lives.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has commissioned three reports on neurology services, one in 2003, another three years later, and the last one was presented to the HSE in December 2007 but it has not been published.  I wonder why it has not been published.  Like the reports before it, the third report criticises the fact there are just 20 neurologists, nine neurosurgeons, six rehabilitation specialists and only 110 rehabilitation beds in the country.  Services are seriously underresourced and it is having a devastating effect on patients.</P>
        <P>The three reports indicate we have less than half the consultant neurologists required.  With only 20 consultant neurologists, Ireland has proportionately the lowest number in Europe.  The 2003 report found we needed 42 consultant neurologists, but after three reports within five years, we still have less than half the recommended requirement.</P>
        <P>The HSE and the Department of Health and Children are fond of commissioning report after report, gathering information to establish and re-establish what we already know, but they are not so good at implementing the recommendations of their reports.  They seem to consistently ignore them.</P>
        <P>Since the IHF audit was published we have seen stroke units being named which will not be staffed or have enough beds to cater for the full throughput of patients.  Arising from a presentation at the IHF stroke conference, the HSE announced that stroke units are in place in the Mater, St James&rsquo;, Clonmel, Navan, Sligo, Portiuncula, with Connolly and Kilkenny opening in the summer.  Will the Minister and Minister of State confirm these units are staffed and bedded to cater for the likely throughput?  The HSE and the Department of Health and Children are failing brain injury and stroke victims.  Their function should be about providing medical care, not about drawing up reports that are ignored and maintaining a costly bulging bureaucratic behemoth that is denying resources to frontline services.</P>
        <P>Stroke is the third largest cause of death and disability worldwide and constitutes a formidable burden of disability for patients, their carers and the wider community.  Each year, <Col N="513"/>approximately 10,000 people are admitted to hospital in the Republic of Ireland with stroke disease as a primary diagnosis.  It is estimated that more than 30,000 people in Ireland are survivors of stroke and many of them have significant residual disabilities.</P>
        <P>Neurological conditions affect approximately 700,000 people in Ireland.  Such conditions are those which affect the brain and spinal cord.  Many of them are common and treatable but early intervention is the key.  As stated, there is only one hospital, with just 110 beds, in the country for those who suffer an acquired brain injury.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A report by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al, commissioned by the Government in 2003, recommended that 42 neurologists were needed to serve the Irish population.  People are currently obliged to wait up to two years to see a neurologist for diagnosis and commencement of treatment.  Neurological conditions need to be identified and treated as soon as possible.  The delay to which I refer is completely unacceptable.  The projected increase in the number of people with neurological conditions will place considerable strain on services already under pressure as a result of long waiting lists, lack of rehabilitation facilities and personnel shortages at all levels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Labour Party on tabling this important and timely motion.  I was disappointed by the somewhat disinterested, hands-off response of the Minister and the Minister of State in respect of this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a correct assessment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is either an issue at stake or there is not.  The Minister and the Minister of State failed to acknowledge or speak to the motion.  They also failed to indicate whether a problem exists and, if it does, the scale thereof.  These are serious issues that affect people and their families.  The latter are suffering.  Neither the Minister nor the Minister of State acknowledged that fact.  Both contributions were back-slapping, self-congratulatory, amateurish and insulting in nature.  I do not like to say that but I am extremely angry about this matter.  In addition, I am extremely concerned.  I am of the impression that neither the Minister nor the Minister of State saw their speeches before they entered the House.  They merely took possession of them and read them into the record.  It seems there is an attitude to the effect that &ldquo;We will go home and all will be grand&rdquo;.  However, people are suffering and the Minister and Minister of State do not even seem to care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extremely worrying when Ministers do not care and when they merely come before the House, go through the motions and refer to the millions spent here and the millions spent there.  They never state that there is a problem, that they need to do better and that Ireland is not as good as other countries in certain respects.</P>
        <P>Ireland lags far behind international best practice and standards in the area of stroke rehabilitation.  I travelled to Germany last autumn, at my own expense, to view rehabilitation centres in that jurisdiction.  I was absolutely blown away by the scale of those centres, the service provided and the level of treatment of which people could, almost instantaneously, avail.  I was informed that a huge percentage of the people treated at the centres, stroke and acquired brain injury victims, would be able to return home and lead almost normal lives.  The commitment people in Germany display in respect of this matter is staggering.  The Minister and the Minister of State should travel there to see what is on offer.  On the next occasion on which they come before the House, they should write their own speeches and not rely on others to do it for them.  They should focus on the people who are suffering on a daily basis.  They repeated the litany regarding the hundreds of millions and billions that is trotted out by Ministers at every opportunity.  If so much money has been invested, why is the service so appalling?  Why are <Col N="514"/>older people who suffered strokes lying in hospital and nursing home beds this evening, staring up at the ceiling and praying to die?  Why are young people obliged to wait months or, in some cases, years for rehabilitation, particularly when it is provided within hours or days in other European countries?</P>
        <P>The Minister has been in power for ten years and has had unprecedented wealth at her disposal and she now has the audacity to insult the House and the nation by delivering an amateurish, back-slapping, disinterested contribution.  It makes my blood boil.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not refer to the Irish Heart Foundation report.  Does she agree with the assertion in the report to the effect that stroke units are virtually non-existent?  The Minister should have addressed matters of this nature in her contribution and should not have stated that hundreds of millions of taxpayers&rsquo; money was spent on this and that.  The Irish Heart Foundation report also states that only a tiny fraction of patients who might benefit from acute interventions such as thrombolosis are correctly assessed.  It further states that acute rehabilitation is only available to one in four patients or is delayed beyond the point at which it is most effective.  Is that true?</P>
        <P>The report of the Irish Heart Foundation also states that the results are predictable and that too many people die from stroke because they cannot access optimal treatment sufficiently rapidly.  People are dying.  Does the Minister care?  Is she aware of what is happening or is she insulated from what is happening in the real world?</P>
        <P>The report further states that too many survivors are left with avoidable and unduly prolonged disability.  The Minister referred to establishing review groups.  Such a group was established in 2003 and a second one has now been set up to review its findings.  What the hell is the Minister playing at?  Ten or 12 years ago, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, visited Cork and informed us that a rehabilitation centre was to be established there.  However, this did not happen.  Why was that the case?  The Minister, Deputy Harney, did not provide information in that regard.  We have asked this question time and again but we have not received an answer because Ministers do not care.  The Government has been in power too long and its members are out of touch.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Devins, failed to provide a timescale or targets in respect of the national strategy for the provision of rehabilitation services.  All he provided were words and these mean nothing to people.  That is absolutely not good enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State provided&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Only 5% of patients are admitted to hospital within two hours of stroke onset.  Why is that the case?  The Irish Heart Foundation report states there were only 12 stroke unit beds nationally and that 30% of hospitals do not have routine access to CT scanning within 48 hours of someone having a stroke.  Why is that the case?  Following ten years in power and with huge amounts of money available, this is the state in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>I recently met a girl who was informed by the HSE that she would never walk again.  She travelled to a clinic in Germany for treatment and she is now walking.  What is happening in this country is beyond belief.  Ireland has the worst record in Europe in respect of this matter.  When I made my trip to Germany, I discovered that the various services required are offered at stationary centres.  There are 15 such centres in southern Germany alone.  Around these are located ambulant or day-care centres into which people can walk.  The rehabilitation centres in Germany are funded by insurance payments and from contributions by the state.</P>
        <P>Why can the Government here not get its act together and do something?  Will timescales or deadlines be provided?  When will a proper service be available?  The Minister is in charge &mdash; she is responsible and accountable.  If she cannot do what is required, she should resign and <Col N="515"/>her job should be given to someone who can.  It is as simple as that.  This matter has been dragging on for too long and it is far too serious for that.</P>
        <P>I apologise for becoming emotional about this matter.  However, I am familiar with people and their families who are suffering a great deal.  There was no feeling or emotion from the Minister or the Minister of State.  They rattled off statistics and referred to the spending of millions and billions.  However, this does not mean anything to anyone.  The Government needs to start thinking about people and providing services for them.  Those of us on this side of the House are not in a position to do this but the Minister is and she has a responsibility in that regard.</P>

The people in charge should wake up and provide proper rehabilitation services across the board because currently they are non-existent.

Perhaps the Minister can send someone in here tomorrow to explain why it is so bad and at least acknowledge that there is a problem.  Alternatively, they can tell us that there is no problem and everything is grand so we can all go home because we are wasting our time.

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister was talking about an average life expectancy but, as she knows, averaging can be a dangerous science.  It is like the woman who found her head in the fridge and her legs in the fire, but on average she was supposed to be all right.  We are talking about a cohort of Irish people who could not have a more difficult situation.  I am one of the many TDs who had the good fortune to be briefed a couple of weeks ago by BR&Iacute; and the Irish Heart Foundation.  I am ashamed that there are many aspects of the matter about which I was not fully aware.  In the coming years, I will do everything I can to ensure that the route of those who suffer an acquired brain injury &mdash; as a result of an accident at work, on the road or a stroke &mdash; will not be like this.  People with such injuries are brought to Beaumont Hospital and get a very good service but it is limited.  Invariably the ambulance is soon on its way back to the local hospital.  Unfortunately, that is only a limbo because local hospitals do not have the expertise to deal with brain injury.  They do the best they can with a view to gaining admission for such patients to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  </P>
        <P>Over the past five years, I have spent endless hours talking to consultants, bed managers, HSE managers and others but to no avail.  I can think of two or three people in County Galway who are lying in a vegetative state in a hospital bed that was never intended for them.  It is an awful tragedy.</P>
        <P>The one thing we have learned from the debate is that, as the Minister said in her speech, there will not be a single additional bed in D&uacute;n Laoghaire until 2012 at the earliest.  They are seeking planning permission in mid-2008.  Unless I have misunderstood, that sort of timetable will go back by three or four years.  We can take it therefore that the immense pressure on the National Rehabilitation Hospital from all over the country will continue for the next seven or <Col N="517"/>eight years because there will not be one extra bed.  Shame on the Minister and on the Government.</P>

	<P>I compliment the Labour Party Members on introducing this important motion.  They are to be congratulated on bringing it to the floor of the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>People with brain injury are being forced to go through drudgery, but there is no case to be made against investing in the necessary beds.  A delay of even two weeks in treating acquired brain injury cases is too long because it is remarkable what medical science can do under the right circumstances.  Can one imagine the trauma for the families concerned who are told that nothing can be done for their son, daughter, father or mother?  All they will get is a monthly assessment for a year or two.  I was informed by representatives of BR&Iacute; that for every one person admitted, at least three other urgent cases cannot find the required beds.  One must imagine the personal problems involved for such families, including financial hardship and acute pain.  They visit a hospital every day but nothing can be done for their loved ones.  As they did not make the financial arrangements in time over the years, they know it is unlikely their loved one will ever get into the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Even if they do, it will be delayed by six months or a year and great damage will be done as a result.  How can one expect any politicians, whether on the Government or Opposition benches, or the public to say the Government has done well on this topic?  If the Minister thinks she is doing well, she is even more foolish than she looks.  It is an outrageous carry-on because we know this can be ameliorated from the medical point of view.  In so far as medical science is concerned, we know this is a win-win situation.</P>
        <P>If the families of young married men or women with acquired brain injury were listening to what the Minister and Minister of State had to say, they would be absolutely disgusted.  We are having this debate on behalf of such people.  I compliment organisations such as Headway, BR&Iacute; and the Irish Heart Foundation which have done a wonderful job on behalf of those who are least able to help themselves.  If we have any social conscience left we should do something about this matter.  The next time the Minister for Health and Children speaks I hope it will be possible for her to announce arrangements for extra beds at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, which is one of the best in Europe, a long time before 2012 or 2015.  I sincerely hope <Col N="518"/>the Minister and Minister of State will take seriously what we have said tonight, otherwise it will come back to haunt them.  I guarantee that.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed the Minister for Health and Children, who has primacy for this issue, has left the Chamber.  I would have liked if she stayed for the five minutes allocated to me on this issue.  There was a proposal made at the end of March that the number of consultants operating at Mallow General Hospital be reduced from three to two.  This was on the termination of a contract of employment.  The result of the termination would have been to reduce accident and emergency cover within the hospital from seven days to five, resulting in Monday to Friday cover from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  This decision was already taken, a <i>fait accompli</i> and, but for the actions of people such as the Mallow Hospital Action Committee, of which I am secretary, Friends of Mallow Hospital and general practitioners who came out fighting and held a press conference, deciding that an expression of &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; would be placed in the management of Mallow General Hospital, the management would have proceeded with the decision without a &ldquo;by your leave&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Because of the action, the furore, and the amount of public protest as a result of the decision, the HSE has stated that it is in a position to fill the post with a locum consultant until the end of May.  We have no commitment in writing that the HSE is intent on the continuation of a third surgical position at Mallow.  We fear the intention of the HSE and the Minister to downgrade our hospital and reduce by stealth the number of surgical posts in the hospital, thereby reducing the accident and emergency services and funnelling everything to CUH which, if one believes the HSE, is the new Jerusalem in the south and will solve all our ills.  We believe the process will have a detrimental effect on the lives of the 100,000 people in the catchment area of Mallow General Hospital, having an adverse effect on medical outcomes.  CUH is ill-equipped to deal with the extra work load this development will entail.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister of State to give guarantees in writing that Mallow, as a secondary care facility, will continue as the centre of excellence that it is, that the 100 GPs referring patients to the hospital will have the accident and emergency cover they need and that there will be three surgeons or more to provide the service to more than 100,000 people who require it.  We also want to ensure that the hospital &mdash; an excellent facility &mdash; goes from strength to strength and will not be downgraded any further.</P>
        <P>We demand a clear commitment in writing from the HSE, that it will ensure the continuation of a third surgical position so that we can deliver services to our people on the ground.  We have no confidence in the current management system because we have listened to promises on the roll-out of a CT scanner, which has been idle for more than three years.  We have no radiologist in the hospital, which was promised.  We have no executive management board, which was promised and for which the HSE stated it would embark on a consultation process.  The dogs on the street know that a 15 minute consultation with one or two GPs does not constitute a consultation in our book.  We call for the instigation of an executive management <Col N="519"/>board so that we can call into question any decisions on the future of the hospital and examine and provide an audit report of any accounting procedures relating to the hospital.</P>
        <P>We want to see a centre of excellence at Mallow.  It has a positive effect on the outcomes of patients in the region and we will oppose vehemently any attempt by the HSE to downgrade services.  We want to see firm commitments from the Minister of State and to see the third post instigated in perpetuity so that the people of the region can have a proper standard of care, and excellent care at that.</P>

	<P>I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health services possible and doing so both effectively and efficiently.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, to ensure that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved.  The Health Information and Quality Authority was established on a statutory basis in 2007 and is responsible for driving quality and safety in the health and social care services.  In 2007 a new Medical Practitioners Act was enacted, the first major overhaul in 30 years of the law regulating the medical profession.  In 2007 the Minister also established the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to develop proposals for a health service wide system of governance based on corporate accountability for the quality and safety of all health services.  In this context it is essential that every health care provider and facility is fully cognisant of patient safety issues and takes account of these in the organisation, management and delivery of services.</P>
        <P>In respect of Mallow General Hospital, the HSE has indicated that patient safety is of paramount importance to the hospital management and that it intends to undertake a systems and risk management review of surgical services at the hospital.  Draft terms of reference are being drawn up and will be discussed with the relevant parties before they are finalised.  To ensure that surgical services continue to be delivered safely in the meantime, the hospital management met recently with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and consultants at Mallow General Hospital and they have agreed arrangements for consultant surgeon cover at Mallow General Hospital, which will apply until 31 May 2008.</P>
        <P>The parties have also agreed to meet and discuss arrangements for surgical services after this period.  The HSE will continue to work closely with all involved to ensure that a high quality service is available to all patients at Mallow General Hospital.</P>

	<P>The problem is that the Minister of State is making a joke out of an issue and will not let me speak on it.</P>
        <P>Deputy Michael Ahern is one of the Ministers who has allowed Cork Airport to be saddled with a debt that it should never have had, because of lobbying from the Dublin Airport Authority, and from Dublin Deputies.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Of course, that is not true at all. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State failed.  He shall have his opportunity in a minute and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.  The reality is that back in 2003, the Minister made the right decision, split up Aer Rianta and set up three independent airports at Cork, Shannon and Dublin &mdash; to provide some competition between them.  It was also a correct decision to go ahead with the new airport terminal in Cork Airport, but Aer Rianta was to build it at the time the decision was made.  In order to get Cork Airport and its staff to buy into the separation of Aer Rianta and allay concerns about the cost of building the new terminal in Cork, it was made absolutely clear at the time that an independent Cork and Shannon would be able to compete with Dublin on a debt-free basis. </P>
        <P>Members of the new board appointed by the Minister at the time were given assurances that they would take up their positions on the basis of managing and developing a new independent Cork Airport, with a debt-free status.  Since then everything has changed.  The cost of the terminal was more than what had been budgeted for, but the financial management of that project was handled by the Dublin Airport Authority, not the Cork Airport Authority.  Now, following a report by Mr. Peter Cassells &mdash; an initiative to try to distance Government and ministerial responsibility from this issue which was essentially based on a political promise &mdash; Cork Airport is being saddled with a debt of &euro;113 million, which it has to service on an annual basis.  No doubt, the Minister of State will dismiss this by saying Cork Airport has a land bank which it can sell off to finance some of that debt.  That land should have been used for future expansion and growth at Cork Airport &mdash; to put in place moneys for an aggressive marketing budget so that Cork can compete aggressively, grow and take traffic away from Dublin, which is overcrowded.</P>
        <P>Dublin Airport needs a competitive Cork Airport as much as Cork does.  Yesterday, we saw the result of the betrayal of Cork Airport by Cork Ministers and Government Deputies, when the chairman of the authority announced he would step down in June and not stand for re-election.  This was a chairman we all hoped would carry Cork forward and develop it into an airport that has the potential to grow even more rapidly, given its terminal has the capacity to take between 5 million and 6 million passengers.  Instead, we have an airport that will be less competitive than it should be and more expensive for airlines and passengers because of the fact that it has to service the debt on which we were given assurances in 2003, confirmed again in 2004 before the new board was set up at Cork.</P>
        <P>People will dismiss this issue by asking why Dublin should pay for Cork, insisting the Dublin Airport Authority has enough to worry about in developing Dublin Airport.  The reality is that when Aer Rianta was split up, the Dublin Airport Authority was given assets to compensate <Col N="521"/>it for taking on debt at Cork and Shannon &mdash; the Great Southern Hotel group, which it subsequently sold for &euro;230 million and Aer Rianta International.</P>
        <P>The board of Cork Airport voted to accept a debt of &euro;113 million last week on the basis of another promise from the Minister to the effect that if the authority got into difficulties in servicing debt in the future, the Government would assist it on that.  I want the Minister of State to clarify for the House this evening what the basis of that promise was and what the actual commitment from this Government is towards assisting the Cork Airport Authority in servicing debt into the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On the announcement yesterday of Mr. Joe Gantly&rsquo;s decision to step down from the board at the end of July next, the Minister paid tribute to his achievements during his time as chairman.  In responding to the Deputy, I propose to set out the initiatives that the Minister has taken to facilitate the separation of Cork airport from the DAA, a key objective that he shares with Mr. Gantly.  The Minister has co-operated with Mr. Gantly in the endeavour to resolve outstanding issues relating to separation. </P>
        <P>The State Airports Act, 2004 provides the framework for the establishment of Shannon and Cork as independent airports.  As part of the airport restructuring process the boards of Cork and Shannon airport are required to prepare business plans for eventual separation.</P>
        <P>The Cork business plan was submitted to the DAA at the end of last year and subsequently forwarded to me with DAA&rsquo;s commentary.  There were clear divergences between both authorities on the business plan and particularly on the level of debt that the CAA would absorb in its business plan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To break the impasse between the two bodies the Minister decided to appoint Mr. Peter Cassells to engage in a constructive dialogue with the CAA and DAA boards in order to establish whether there was a basis for a speedy resolution of the disagreement between the two parties.  Mr. Cassells reported to the Minister on the matter and the Minister published his report on 2 April.</P>
        <P>His conclusions and recommendations were the outcome of that dialogue with the DAA and CAA.  They provided an opportunity for a final decision to be made on the financial consideration to be paid by the CAA in respect of the transfer of net assets of &euro;220 million on separation.  In essence, they provided the Cork Airport Authority with a funding solution post separation of &euro;20 million to &euro;40 million, in return for the transfer of net assets of &euro;220 million, while reducing DAA&rsquo;s indebtedness by &euro;113 million.</P>
        <P>The Minister believed Mr. Cassells&rsquo;s recommendations represented a sensible solution to this impasse, which he urged both parties to accept as soon as possible.  He then asked Mr. Cassells to assist the two boards as regards bringing the issue to a speedy, mutually acceptable conclusion.  Mr. Cassells&rsquo; subsequent efforts lead to the acceptance of his report by the CAA Board on 10 April last.</P>
        <P>The Minister would point out, as previously stated, that he gave no assurances to the CAA about financial support from the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That was not on, was it? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is Government policy that commercial State-sponsored bodies should operate to a commercial mandate, to include the capacity to finance capital investment without Exchequer support.  The State Airports Act envisages that the three State airports will operate to such a commercial mandate.  Any proposal to depart from this policy would, in any event, require EU Commission approval under the relevant Commission guidelines for state aid in the airport sector. </P><Col N="522"/>
        <P>A process of engagement will now commence with all the relevant parties on implementation and the technical and legal issues involved will be progressed by the Cork and Shannon airport authorities and the Department.</P>
        <P>It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention therefore to proceed without delay to effect the full separation of the three State airports, as set out in the State Airports Act 2004.  This process will involve the preparation of revised business plans taking account of the Cassells&rsquo; recommendations.</P>

	<P>This is a joke. </P>

	<P>In due course, the business plans will be submitted to the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance for approval as regards the State airports&rsquo; financial and operational readiness. </P>
        <P>The Minister looks forward to working with the CAA board, as it proceeds with the next steps for the airport&rsquo;s separation from the DAA.  Also, as part of this process, there will be a need to engage in necessary consultation with stakeholders.  In this regard the Minister recognises that there is an understanding with ICTU concerning the framework for consultation with trade unions on the airport business plans.</P>
        <P>The Minister would reassure all concerned that the legal commitments enshrined in the State Airports Act concerning the protection of terms and conditions of employment of State airport employees, as well as the requirements for consultation on future collective bargaining structures, will be honoured in full.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle, at the outset, for selecting this item this evening for debate. </P>
        <P>On behalf of the board of management, staff, pupils and parents of Eglish national school, Ballinasloe, County Galway, I ask that the Minister respond to their needs with the immediate replacement of the school in the interests of health and safety and provide temporary accommodation.  In the short time available, I will describe the conditions in the school adequately so the Minister of State can respond.  The school was built in 1899 and is therefore 109 years old.  It has 48 pupils in its two rooms.  Over the years, Department funding would normally be provided to upgrade such a school, but not in this case.  Without exaggeration, I contend the Minister of State will be horrified at the crisis in the school, which requires an urgent response.  Let me quote the response of the board of management and new principal of the school to the conditions therein:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Our school is 109 years old and is falling down around us.  We have no central heating, only one hot water source, heating one tap.  The roof is rotten and slates fall off regularly.  The walls are cracking at an alarming rate, the wiring is a fire hazard.  We have damp, mould, snails, rats and bats.  The windows are rotten and leaking &mdash; several have had to be nailed <Col N="523"/>shut to stop them from falling in.  The toilet floors are regularly flooded ....  In short, we desperately need a new school.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The application for a new school is with the Department in Tullamore.</P>
        <P>There is a crisis in the school.  To add to it, there are pupils with special needs who have no facilities whatsoever.  Access via the steps and narrow doors is not possible for a person in a wheelchair.  There is an autistic pupil at the school but there is no place for one-to-one education, except in a draughty hallway.  I cannot understand how any Minister for Education and Science, conscious of health and safety, can allow this to continue.  The authorities are seeking a new school.  The old one will have to be knocked down and temporary accommodation will have to be provided.  A new teacher is due in the school next September but there is no room for that teacher.</P>
        <P>In the interest of health and safety, the board of management had to call in Rentokil to eliminate the rats from the school and its surroundings.  The last sentence in Rentokil&rsquo;s report states: &ldquo;I would recommend that young children be kept indoors until the rodent activity is controlled.&rdquo;  If, in 2008, this is the best we can do for the children, parents and staff associated with Eglish national school, we have a very serious crisis.</P>
        <P>I do not want to hear the Minister of State list the funding allocated for school renovations in 2008 and over the past ten years.  This is not what the people of Eglish want to hear tonight.  I ask that he make a positive gesture and put in place a plan for issuing an immediate response to the board of management.  We cannot condemn children to endure the aforedescribed circumstances in this 109 year old school in order to provide them with an education.  If we are serious about providing them with an education, some semblance of support for those who are disadvantaged is required.  I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s response but I cannot understand why such a crisis must be inflicted on pupils in this day and age.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House my Department&rsquo;s position on the proposed new school at Eglish.  Eglish national school is a co-educational facility with a current enrolment of 48 pupils.  The school has a principal, a mainstream assistant and a resource teacher for Travellers.</P>
        <P>An application for capital funding towards the provision of a new school building has been received from Eglish national school.  The long-term projected staffing assessment and the further progression of the proposed building project is under consideration.  In the interim, officials in my Department have been in contact with the school management regarding the provision of temporary accommodation.  Additional information is expected from the school management shortly and when this documentation is received the school authority will be notified of the position without delay.</P>
        <P>I will not refer to the money spent in the past; suffice it to say that, under the national development plan, almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  This investment will facilitate the provision of new schools and extensions in developing areas and the improvement of existing schools, through the provision of replacement schools, extensions or large-scale refurbishments over the coming years.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the national development plan and the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual schools building and modernisation programme.  The proposed project for Eglish national school likewise will be considered in that context.  I assure the Deputy that the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is committed to providing suitable high-quality accommodation for Eglish national school at the earliest possible date.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue.  I call on the Minister for Education and Science to grant university status to the Institute of Technology, Tralee.</P>
        <P>The past 40 years have seen a massive expansion in the growth and range of higher education institutions worldwide.  In Ireland, as in many other countries, the response to demand for third level education resulted in the establishment of institutions with the specific remit of being close to the world of work.  The development and growth of the network of institutes of technology has greatly enhanced access to third level education across the country and to many students who might not have entered third level were they not available.</P>
        <P>Our third level institutions have responded well to the demands of a rapidly changing Ireland and a changing world and they are uniquely placed to respond to new demands of both a local and international nature.  All our institutes of technology have established reputations in teaching, innovation and research but many of those centrally involved in our institutes now say the dual titling system in Ireland is creating unnecessary confusion.</P>
        <P>New thinking is now emerging on the needs of current and future workforces, the economy and society.  Across the world, different models are being developed for universities that better reflect the increasing diversity of types of institutions in higher education.  In other countries systems have now been developed and re-aligned in response to the needs of students and society.  Some countries, such as Germany and Finland, have dealt with the ambiguity of the institutional title by reclassifying their equivalent institutions as &ldquo;universities of applied science&rdquo;.  This has not only addressed ambiguities but has also enhanced the ability of these colleges to attract students and compete more effectively for research funding and trade internationally.</P>
        <P>The agreed paper on university designation from 12 institutes of technology, including the Institute of Technology, Tralee, asks that the matter be addressed now rather than allow growing local campaigns to distract from the real issues of meeting the rising knowledge needs of young people, the workforce, enterprise and the economy.  The paper states maintaining the <i>status quo</i> is not sustainable and outlines three options: federal university arrangements among all institutes of technology; federal arrangements between institutes of technology and existing universities; or the renaming of the institutes to include &ldquo;university&rdquo; in the title.</P>
        <P>At the Institute of Technology, Tralee, one of the signatories to the aforementioned agreed paper, students are offered a wide range of courses within a dynamic learning environment.  With superb facilities and student services, the institute has been to the forefront of learning since its establishment and has gained a reputation as a centre of distinction for teaching, learning, research and academic achievement.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The mission statement of the institute is: &ldquo;To excel in teaching, research and development work, for the benefit of students, industry and the wider community&rdquo;.  It offers a range of programmes ranging from certificate through to honours degree, masters and PhD level.  Enhancing the taught programmes is a world class programme of research.  The institute is a major contributor, both nationally and regionally, to economic, social and cultural development.  Its programmes and research activities are influenced by national and regional needs and constantly refined to absorb the very latest developments and innovations.</P>
        <P>The institute shares its campus with Kerry Technology Park and has fostered close links with companies based there.  The multi-million euro development master plan has seen significant developments in learning, teaching, research and student sports facilities, providing quality facilities for learners.  The institute has a strong record of innovation in programme design and <Col N="525"/>delivery and has led the sector in a number of areas, for example, the add-on degree structure; e-learning and methodologies; video conferencing and so on.</P>
        <P>Strong links with external organisations and companies result in the institute delivering a true competitive advantage to the business community.  It is committed to maintaining the highest levels of quality education and research through further developing its collaborative links with industry and educational and research institutions internationally.  The range of activities undertaken properly classifies the institute as a university and it is actually recognised as such within the European Union.</P>
        <P>Further expansion of international activities is planned.  It is vitally important that the status of the institute is readily understood at home and abroad.  University designation would be hugely beneficial for the regional economy, providing a further incentive for investment by both local and international industry.  It would mean better recognition for the college on an international level and broaden the scope for collaboration with universities worldwide.  The application for university status is based on merit.  In most countries the term &ldquo;university&rdquo; would be the only accurate description for the institution that the Institute of Technology Tralee has become.  I urge the Minister to consider conferring university status on the institute.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The process for designation of an educational institution as a university is prescribed by the Universities Act 1997.  Section 9 of the Act provides that the Government may appoint a body which will include national and international experts to advise the Higher Education Authority on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university, an educational institution should be established as a university.  On the advice of the body and the recommendation of the authority, the Government may, by order, provide that the institution shall be a university for the purposes of the Act.</P>
        <P>To date applications have been received to invoke section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997 from Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and Cork Institute of Technology.  The Department of Education and Science has not received an application from Institute of Technology Tralee for designation as a university.  Applications for designation as a university require a detailed examination in the context not only of the statutory process to which they are subject but also their wider implications for higher education policy generally.</P>
        <P>In 2004 the Government commissioned a comprehensive review of the higher education system.  The OECD considered that for a country with a population of just over 4 million, Ireland had a significant number of higher education institutions and that the differentiation of mission within the sector had been a significant contributory factor to economic growth.  It recommended that such differentiation be preserved and that there should be no further institutional transfers into the university sector.  It identified an enormously important role for the institutes of technology in regional development and in respect of a broad range of qualifications and applied research, while the university sector should be expected to carry the major research role, especially in fundamental and basic research.  It also recommended better co-ordination of policy towards the sectors by bringing them together under a common authority with machinery to prevent mission drift in either direction but with a loosening of controls on the institutes.</P>
        <P>The broad thrust of the OECD recommendations were accepted by the Government in 2005 and reflected in the Institutes of Technology Act 2006 which addresses significant elements of these recommendations and marks a major milestone for the sector and the development of higher education.  Its commencement last year provides for the creation of a unified manage<Col N="526"/>ment structure framework for higher education by bringing the institutes of technology sector under the remit of the Higher Education Authority.</P>
        <P>The legislation also extends significant new managerial and academic autonomy to the institutes, aimed at facilitating further development of their roles.  For example, institutes will have the right and responsibility to preserve and promote the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of their internal and external affairs.  The budgets of individual institutes will now be set by the HEA rather than by the Department and specific approval to run individual courses or programmes will no longer be required.  The institutes will also be able to borrow funds under a framework agreed with the HEA and the Departments of Finance and Education and Science.  It has also been accepted that income generated by third level institutions from external sources should not be subject to offsetting in the allocation of Exchequer funding.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the profile of institutes of technology has changed considerably.  They now provide a much higher proportion of degree courses.  Whereas in 1997 only the DIT had degree awarding powers, now all institutes have delegated authority from HETAC to award degrees, some up to doctoral level.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science and the HEA are already working on ways in which the specific research capacity of the institutes can be enhanced through the dedicated funding stream of the technology sector research programme.  The need to strengthen the overall research capability of the institutes of technology, while ensuring coherence is maintained within the higher education system, is also acknowledged.  Measures such as the technological sector research programme have been put in place specifically to assist them in developing this capacity.  Some &euro;7 million is earmarked for this year.  It is expected that this funding will be increased incrementally under the strategy for science, technology and innovation.  Institutes also benefit from funding from Enterprise Ireland, for example, for incubation centres and technology transfer offices.</P>
        <P>The Institute of Technology Tralee has gained a reputation as a centre of distinction for teaching, learning and research.  It has a practical orientation designed to be responsive to the needs of the local industry and business.  In particular, it has fostered very close links with the companies based in Kerry Technology Park.  The Government is committed to supporting the institute into the future in continuing to make a significant contribution to the economic, social and cultural development of the south west and beyond.  The Government wants to build on our strengths and provide an environment where all our higher education institutions can develop in a way that best serves the country as a whole and the regions where they are based.  These issues must be central to consideration of any application for designation as a university.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter.</P>

        <Quest>  the cost of the current climate change media campaign to date; the expected expenditure in the future; the number of website hits he expects per year; if there is monitoring of results of such an investment; the way this campaign differs from previous public information campaigns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The over-riding goal of the Government communications and public awareness campaign on climate change, the Change Campaign, is to engage the nation in such a way as to drive significant behavioural change to reduce and avoid greenhouse gas emissions. The strategic starting point is to create a shared understanding of the challenge. This is being done through working with stakeholder groups, through TV, radio and outdoor advertising, the use of web-based tools, public events and intensive media engagement.</P>
        <P>The Change Campaign differs from most other public information campaigns in that the approach includes a significant stakeholder engagement element. Much of the resources of this campaign will be used to work in partnership with stakeholders from various sectors to develop appropriate, relevant and useful tools and techniques to lower greenhouse gas emissions. The approach was previously used by my Department in the very successful Race Against Waste Campaign.  The cost of the Change Campaign for its first two years will be &euro;12.5m exclusive of VAT, to be paid for from the Environment Fund.   To date, over &euro;1 million (&euro;1,009,980.43) has been paid.  Comprehensive evaluation and monitoring systems have been put in place to track the effectiveness of the campaign in delivering on its objectives.  A quantitative benchmarking barometer, which covers a nationally representative sample of adults, will be used to track the <Col N="528"/>effectiveness of the advertising element.  In addition, qualitative research will be conducted periodically to steer the strategic thrust of campaign messaging.</P>

        <P>The campaign website, www.change.ie, will be an important vehicle for providing information to the public.  Its effectiveness in fulfilling this task will be measured through monitoring the number of unique visitors to the site, the amount of time people remain on the site and the areas of the site that they visit. The number of people who register with the site, use the carbon calculator and subscribe to the electronic newsletter will also be monitored.  Given that a campaign of this scale, on an issue as complex as climate change, has not been undertaken previously in Ireland, it is difficult to make any meaningful prediction about the number of website hits.  For the Stakeholder Engagement aspect, an initial benchmarking exercise will be undertaken to establish the current knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours of those with whom we hope to engage. This measurement will be repeated at intervals throughout the campaign to assess progress. We will also monitor the number of organisations engaging with the campaign through their attendance at events and their use of the Carbon Management Tool, which will be developed as part of the campaign.</P>
        <P>The campaign also seeks to engage print and broadcast media to help communicate its messages to the public. All media coverage generated will be tracked and evaluated on a daily basis to measure effectiveness. At the end of each year, a comprehensive and independent analysis of all media coverage will be commissioned to evaluate the effectiveness of this aspect of the campaign.  The Change Campaign will serve a vital purpose in helping individuals and organisations from all sectors of our economy and society to address the challenges that climate change presents. It will do this in a positive way that encourages people to play their full part in contributing towards Ireland&rsquo;s response to this global challenge.</P>

        <Quest>  if the &euro;50 collected as part of the &euro;70 Private Residential Tenancies Board registration fee is ring fenced for allocation to the local authority in whose area it is collected to enable it to perform its functions under the Housing Acts; and the monitoring that is undertaken by his Department to ensure that the money allocated is used for the purpose intended.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides for a registration fee of &euro;70 per tenancy where it is registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board within one month of the tenancy&rsquo;s commencement.  &euro;50 of each &euro;70 fee is used to create a pool of funding from which allocations are made to local authorities to assist them in carrying out their functions in relation to private rented accommodation standards and rent books.  Monies from this fund are allocated to local authorities on the basis of a formula which takes into account:</P>
<P el="5">(a) <Miles com="ix" />the number of registered tenancies within each local authority area,</P>
<P el="5">(b) <Miles com="ix" />each authority&rsquo;s inspections targets for the particular year, and</P>
<P el="5">(c) <Miles com="ix" />the actual number of inspections carried out, as reported by local authorities.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Funding is increasingly being related to inspection performance.  Half of the allocation for 2007 is based on actual inspections carried out and it is proposed to make allocations increasingly related to performance in the future.   Accordingly, while allocations will continue to take account of the number of tenancies registered in a local authority&rsquo;s area, the increasing linkage <Col N="529"/>to inspection performance means that where a particular authority&rsquo;s inspection activity is low relative to others, this will be reflected in a reduced allocation.  In overall terms, significantly increased funding is being made available to local authorities in respect of their enforcement activities in relation to private rented accommodation. Over &euro;2m was provided in 2006, an increase of 33% over the corresponding funding in 2005.  A further &euro;3m was allocated in respect of 2007, bringing total funding for this purpose since 2004 to approximately &euro;7m.  It is hoped to increase further the level of funding in 2008 in the light of returns on local authority performance.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>  when he expects to review planning Part V legislation to stop the practice of some local authorities taking mostly cash payments instead of finished housing units; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[14340/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>A review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, undertaken by my Department in 2002 in consultation with a wide range of interested bodies including local authorities and representatives of the house building industry, professional institutes and voluntary housing providers, concluded that greater flexibility in the operation of the Part V mechanism was required.  The review was based on maintaining the principle of community gain while allowing greater flexibility in meeting it.  Measures to achieve this were contained in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002 which introduced a range of options for compliance with Part V.</P>
        <P>The default option for satisfying Part V remains the transfer of a proportion of the land which is the subject of the planning application.  Where the Part V agreement is to be satisfied by means other than the provision of land on-site, the planning authority must consider a range of factors, including whether it will contribute effectively and efficiently to the achievement of the objectives of the housing strategy, and whether it constitutes the best use of the resources available to the authority to ensure an adequate supply of housing. It must be emphasised, therefore, that the legal obligation under Part V can be satisfied by way of a financial contribution only if the local authority considers it appropriate.</P>
        <P>While the Government&rsquo;s clearly stated preference is for Part V to be satisfied through the delivery of completed homes, circumstances can arise in which a financial contribution may be appropriate.  For example, in cases where Part V would yield only a small number of very expensive social and affordable homes, a financial contribution may provide an opportunity to support the delivery of a greater number of homes elsewhere.  All monies received by local authorities under Part V must be ringfenced for reinvestment in the provision of social and affordable housing.  Given that the vast bulk of the significantly increased delivery under Part V is in the form of completed homes or land, I am satisfied that the process is operating effectively.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The total cost incurred to date in the development and roll-out of the electronic voting and counting system is &euro;51.3 million (including some &euro;2.6 million in respect of awareness and education initiatives). In addition, information provided by returning officers to my Department indicates that the total annual storage costs incurred by them in respect of the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment in 2007 is some &euro;489,000, with figures for 2004, 2005 and 2006 amounting to some &euro;658,000; &euro;696,000; and &euro;706,000 respectively. The electronic voting machines do not require maintenance on an ongoing basis. Costs incurred to date in respect of the movement of the electronic voting equipment to centralised storage arrangements are some &euro;328,000.  Further costs will be incurred in relation to the completion of these arrangements, including buy-out costs. </P>
        <P>The Commission on Electronic Voting concluded in its Second Report on the Secrecy, Accuracy and Testing of the Chosen Electronic Voting System, which was published in July 2006, that the voting equipment chosen for use in Ireland could be used, subject to further work which it also recommended.  This included the replacement of the election management software, as well as adaptations to the equipment and further end to end testing.  I am at present considering the next steps to be taken in relation to this project. In this, I am taking into account the work of the Commission on Electronic Voting, relevant experiences and developments internationally, and the need to maintain public confidence in the electoral process, as well as the provisions in the Programme for Government relating to electoral reform generally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 103 and 111 together.</P>
        <P>Standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Failure to do so is an offence, subject, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000, or a term of six months in prison or both and &euro;250 for each day of a continuing offence. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.  Details of <Col N="531"/>the inspections of private rented accommodation carried out, the dwellings inspected which did not meet the statutory standards and prosecutions initiated up to 2006 are included in my Department&rsquo;s Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie. Similar information in respect of 2007 is not yet available.</P>
        <P>The system of funding local authority inspection activity is currently in a stage of transition, from one based solely on numbers of tenancy registrations to one based more on inspection performance.  Consequently, where a particular authority&rsquo;s inspection activity is low relative to others, this is reflected in reduced allocations.  For 2007, a first tranche (&euro;1.5m) of funding issued to local authorities in October 2007, based on the number of registered tenancies and inspection targets for 2007, as reported by local authorities. The second tranche (&euro;1.5m) of this funding will issue shortly to local authorities, based on their inspection outturns for 2007.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide on the specific details of its inspection arrangements. However, in discharging their responsibilities in relation to the private rented sector, authorities should have regard to the report &mdash; Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement &mdash; published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which makes a range of recommendations on matters relevant to inspection procedures such as identifying and targeting inspection requirements.  I am confident that the move towards more performance-related funding has already led to more active inspections regimes and will continue to do so in the period ahead. I am also encouraged by the preliminary inspections figures for 2007 which I am confident will, once finalised, show a continuing and substantial increase in inspections by local authorities.</P>

        <P>Reflecting the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling homelessness, a revised strategy on adult homelessness is currently being finalised.

Reflecting commitments in Towards 2016 and the Programme for Government, the core objective of the new strategy will be the elimination, by 2010, of long-term occupation of emergency homeless accommodation (i.e. longer than 6 months) and the need to sleep rough.</P>
        <P>The revised Government strategy has been developed under the aegis of the Cross-Department Team on Homelessness, which is chaired by my Department.  It has received input from the National Homeless Consultative Committee, which includes representatives of both voluntary and statutory bodies dealing with homelessness.  It has also been subject to Health and <Col N="532"/>Poverty Impact Assessments, both of which included a robust consultation process with relevant parties.  I expect to publish the strategy next month.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 93 and 398 together.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that water supplies achieve full compliance with drinking water standards is reflected in the &euro;4.7 billion in capital funding for water services infrastructure in the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013, an increase of 27% on the previous NDP.   In addition, new drinking water regulations, made in June 2007, gave the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and local authorities significantly enhanced supervisory and enforcement powers in respect of quality standards in public and group water supplies, respectively.</P>
        <P>The EPA publication &ldquo;The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland: A Report of the Years 2006-2007&rdquo; has identified 339 public water supply schemes where detailed profiling is required from source to tap to ensure consumers have a reliable supply that is consistently of a satisfactory standard.  My Department and the EPA are working in conjunction with local authorities urgently to identify, agree and implement appropriate solutions in these cases.  Solutions may range from upgrading treatment facilities to abandoning unsuitable sources or improving operation and maintenance arrangements.  Where significant infrastructural works are required they will be funded by my Department and I have put in place contingency funding arrangements for that purpose.  The EPA will oversee implementation of all remedial actions as part of its enhanced supervisory function.</P>
        <P>My Department has, in recent years, also provided special Local Government Fund assistance to local authorities and group water schemes towards water services operation and maintenance expenses.   In 2008, some &euro;23.4 million is available to local authorities and &euro;16m to group water schemes from this special provision.  Proposals from local authorities for additional staffing resources are considered on their merits, subject to the overall constraint on public sector employment.</P>

        <P>My Department provides significant resources from the proceeds of tenancy registrations collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, to assist local authorities in discharging their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to private rented accommodation.  The provision of additional funding towards the costs involved is a matter for individual local authorities.  A sum of &euro;3m has been earmarked for this purpose in respect of 2007, representing a 50% increase on the 2006 funding. The first tranche (&euro;1.5m) of this allocation, which was paid to local authorities in October 2007, was based on the number of registered tenancies in each local authority area at 31 August 2007 and inspection targets for 2007, as reported by local authorities. The second tranche (&euro;1.5m) of this funding will issue shortly to local authorities based on their inspection outturns for 2007.</P>

My Department chairs an Inter-Departmental Steering Group, which oversees the implementation of the National Biodiversity Plan.  The following Departments are currently represented on this Group: Finance; Arts, Sport and Tourism; Social and Family Affairs; Foreign Affairs; Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; Defence; Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; Health and Children; Transport; Education and Science; as well as the Revenue Commissioners; and the Office of Public Works.

	<P>Record levels of funding for social and affordable housing are being provided in 2008 with over &euro;2.5 billion available for housing programmes generally.  The total Exchequer provision for social housing in 2008 is some &euro;1.57 billion &mdash; an increase of approximately 13% on the 2007 outturn. This funding will allow for the commencement of a significant number of new social housing units, further progress under regeneration programmes, and the completion of a large number of units under both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes.  Good progress is being made on the delivery of social housing programmes with some 9,000 new social housing starts achieved in 2007.  This is in line with the commitment in Towards 2016 to achieve 27,000 starts in the period 2007 to 2009.  The resources being made available for social housing under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 will allow for the needs of some 60,000 households to be met over the full period of the Plan.</P>
        <P>Information on the number of first time lettings by local authorities is published in my Department&rsquo;s Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins.  Details of accommodation provided under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Funding Schemes by approved voluntary and co-operative housing bodies for the years 2000 to 2006 and for the first 9 months of 2007, are also published in my Department&rsquo;s Annual and Quarterly Housing Statistics Bulletins.  All of these publications are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.environ.ie, and in the Oireachtas Library.  Information is also available on the website on the number of houses provided  by local authorities, the voluntary and co-operative sector, and through the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  In the 2003-2007 period (figures for 2007 are provisional), some 35,114 households were assisted <Col N="535"/>through these social housing measures.  Local authorities are currently carrying out the 2008 statutory housing needs assessment the results of which will be published in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 113 together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish a Green Paper on Local Government Reform, to examine a number of issues with the objective of making local government more transparent and responsive. I have published the Green Paper, Stronger Local Democracy &mdash; Options for Change, today.  I established a Consultative Committee, which met for the first time in September 2007, to advise me on the production of the Green Paper. The Committee&rsquo;s members included local government interests, Government Departments and others with an interest in local government. The Committee had initially intended to conclude its work by early December 2007. However, given the breadth of the issues involved, the Committee decided to have a further meeting on 20 December to consider its work. Since then I have been engaged with my Department in reviewing the public submissions and the work of the Consultative Committee, and in preparation of the text of the Paper for today&rsquo;s launch.</P>
        <P>Stronger Local Democracy &mdash; Options for Change represents the initial phase of a transparent, inclusive policy formulation process. Its purpose is not to arrive at a single solution, but to present options for further consideration. It is my objective that it should initiate a broad and lively debate on the future of local government, which will inform the preparation of a White Paper later this year.</P>

	<P>Under Section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of the local authority that benefit development in the area, based on a scheme of contributions adopted by the elected members of the authority.  Subject to this, the types of public infrastructure that can be funded by a development contribution scheme are further specified as:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the acquisition of land,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the provision of open spaces, recreational and community facilities and amenities and landscaping works,</P><Col N="536"/>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the refurbishment, upgrading, enlargement or replacement of roads, car  parks, car parking places, sewers, waste water and water facilities, drains or water mains, and ancillary matters.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Section 49 of the Act provides for the drawing up of a supplementary development contribution scheme in order to facilitate a particular public infrastructure service or project which is provided by a local authority or a private developer and which will directly benefit the development on which the levy is imposed. The types of infrastructure which may be funded by this means include the provision of rail, light rail or other public transport infrastructure, particular new roads or particular water or waste water infrastructure. The assignment of responsibility for developing areas to Minister of State Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe is aimed at better positioning Government at both central and local level to co-ordinate infrastructure development in fast-growing strategic locations throughout the country. My Department is currently undertaking an analysis of the infrastructure requirements in these locations. It is my intention following this analysis to consider the need for any necessary legislative and policy changes to underpin this work, including in the area of development contributions.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan, as provided for in section 31 of the Disability Act 2005, was developed in consultation with people with disabilities to assist the Department and local authorities in supporting an inclusive society with accessible buildings, facilities, services and information.  The Plan provides for monitoring, review and reporting arrangements. There are statutory provisions, codes of practice and guidelines available to assist local authorities in providing the measures required in the Sectoral Plan. One such document is the &ldquo;Code of Practice on Accessibility of Public Services and Information Provided by Public Bodies&rdquo;, published by the National Disability Authority under section 30 of the Disability Act. It covers access to services provided by a public body and the provision of information to the public. This Code will assist local authorities to develop best practice in meeting their obligations under the Act.</P>
        <P>My Department is represented on the Local Government Disability Act Steering Committee, established by the Local Government Management Services Board, to address common issues across local authorities, update best practice guidance where required, organise staff seminars as appropriate and promote consistent implementation of the obligations under the Act across authorities. One of the initiatives taken by the committee was the establishment of the Good Practice in Accessibility website to support local authority personnel implementing the National Disability Strategy. The site showcases good practice, provides practical answers to common <Col N="537"/>queries, hosts a discussion forum and provides links to relevant published material.  My Department has also established a Disability Act Sectoral Plan Advisory Committee, representative of the Department, people with disabilities, the National Disability Authority, bodies under the aegis of the Department and local authorities to provide a forum to assist in the review of progress in implementation of the plan.</P>

	<P>Local authorities may provide sites at low cost to assist persons in need of housing to provide for their own housing. Such housing may be provided either individually, with the help, if necessary, of the other social housing measures including shared ownership, local authority house purchase loans, mortgage allowance, etc. or collectively, through the voluntary housing schemes, special group shared ownership housing projects or housing co-operatives. It is a matter for individual authorities to make available sites in accordance with the above arrangements having regard to housing need and available land.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 413, 415, 421 and 422 together.</P>
        <P>The management of public drinking water supplies, including the assessment of requirements and monitoring of demand and storage capacity, is the responsibility of the local water services authorities, which have a range of instruments and measures available to deal with water supply needs. In addition, my Department finances and manages the Water Services Investment Programme through which schemes for improving water supply infrastructure, active leakage control, telemetry and rehabilitation of water mains are undertaken.  Copies of the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>The schemes included in the Investment Programme are derived mainly from regular assessments of needs undertaken, at my Department&rsquo;s request, by local authorities, including Kildare County Council, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting water supply requirements.  My Department does not engage consultants to determine the priority of schemes in the Programme. The Water Services Act, 2007, provides for preparation of a strategic water services plan by each water services authority for its area at least every 6 years.  Such plans will set out current and projected water services needs and identify the required responses. This process will ensure that water services planning is appropriately integrated with planning for investment in social and economic development.  The relevant provisions will be brought into force as soon as related guidelines and training are available.  I am satisfied that the policies and resources that are in place will ensure that our water supply infrastructure will be able to meet current and anticipated demands.</P>
        <P>While centralised data on drinking water storage capacity are not available to my Department, details of drinking water treatment plant output are contained in the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s publication &ldquo;The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water &mdash; A Report for the Years 2007-2007&rdquo; which is also in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together.</P>
        <P>A lease is defined in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 as an instrument in writing, whether or not under seal, containing a contract of tenancy in respect of a dwelling and, therefore, comes within the jurisdiction of the Act. Tenancy registration is a matter for the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), which is an independent statutory body established under the Act.  Section 134 of the Act requires the landlord of a dwelling to apply to the PRTB to <Col N="539"/>register each tenancy. Section 144 of the Act also provides powers of direction in respect of a tenancy that in the opinion of the Board ought to be registered. In addition a person found guilty of an offence under the Act, such as the provision of false and misleading information is, on summary conviction, liable to a fine of up to &euro;3,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment.  All private rental dwellings are subject to inspection under the Housing (Standards for Rented Housing) Regulations 1993.</P>

        <P>While the production of a local biodiversity action plan is a matter for each local authority, my Department has initiated a number of actions to support this process.  These have included circulation of guidelines on the production of local biodiversity action plans to all local authorities in March 2006, and organisation of a seminar in July 2006, at which some 31 local authorities were represented.  My Department has also been working in cooperation with the Heritage Council to promote the development of local biodiversity action plans, and in 2007 allocated &euro;300,000 for support in this regard.  This funding has facilitated the development of action plans by 20 local authorities.  I have also allocated &euro;300,000 in 2008 as additional funding to support the implementation of these plans. Similarly, my Department circulated guidelines on the preparation of biodiversity action plans to all Government Departments in April 2005.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive review of the status of implementation of all of the 91 actions contained in the National Biodiversity Plan was published in November 2005.

These regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented accommodation and local authorities have responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations in relation to all properties &mdash; local authority, voluntary and private.  The key element in ensuring good standards of local authority housing is the performance of local authorities in relation to the maintenance and, where necessary, improvement of their housing stock.

	<P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 35 of 27 February 2008, I have powers as Minister under section 29 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to issue policy directives to planning authorities regarding any of their functions under the Act, and planning authorities are required to comply with any such directives in the performance of their functions.  No such policy directives have been issued to planning authorities in relation to density levels in high-rise apartment developments.</P>
        <P>On 18 September 2007, I published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments, under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  In accordance with section 28, planning authorities and an Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to the guidelines in the performance of their functions.  The aim of these guidelines is to promote successful apartment living by setting minimum standards for well-designed apartments, particularly in terms of internal space standards, including storage space.  While the guidelines set a range of minimum standards for the design and layout of new apartments, there is no reference in them to density levels within apartment developments or to building heights.</P>
        <P>I also published for public consultation, on 10 February 2008, Draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas, together with an accompanying best practice Urban Design Manual which illustrates how these guidelines can be implemented.  These new draft guidelines, which were also issued under section 28 of the Act, are intended to replace the 1999 Residential Density Guidelines, and are focused on creating sustainable communities by incorporating the highest design standards and providing a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of essential infrastructure and services.  The objectives of the new guidelines are to:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />set out stronger planning requirements to facilitate the development of sustainable communities through strengthening planning and the provision of necessary supporting services and amenities;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />help achieve the most efficient use of urban land through housing densities that are appropriate to the location involved and availability of supporting services and infrastructure, particularly transport; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />set high standards in terms of space and facilities to meet the needs of the Irish context.</P>

I wrote to Midleton Town Council in December 2007 stating that I considered it inappropriate to proceed with the application for a number of reasons, including the lack of agreement between town and county, the passage of time since the initiation of the proposal, and the ongoing process of local government reform.  I published the Green Paper, Stronger Local Democracy &mdash; Options for Change, today (22 April). This will, inter alia, address town boundaries and the wider issue of town and county institutional relationships.

	<P>Under the Litter Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering is a matter for local authorities. The role of my Department is to provide the legislative framework to combat litter pollution, and to motivate and energise anti-litter responses as necessary.  It is the responsibility of each local authority to undertake the most appropriate enforcement and clean-up actions in relation to litter, taking account of local circumstances and priorities. My Department oversees the National Litter Pollution Monitoring System (NLPMS), which measures the extent, composition and causes of litter pollution at the local and national level.  The most recent results published in July 2007 show that cigarette, chewing gum and packaging related litter were among the main components of litter in Ireland in 2006.  It also shows that, while litter is still a serious problem here, the situation is improving gradually each year.</P>
        <P>I am convinced that tackling the problem of litter requires a multi-faceted approach incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education.  To that end, my Department is involved in several anti-litter initiatives including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />National Spring Clean</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) Litter League</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Negotiated Agreements with the Chewing Gum and Banking industries.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, I increased the on-the-spot litter fine from &euro;125 to &euro;150 on 30 September 2007 to send out a clear message that litter pollution will not be tolerated.  The behaviour of the few who do not dispose of their litter in a responsible way needs to be changed and I hope that the increase in the litter fine will have the appropriate impact in that regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 121 together.</P>
        <P>In November 2005, my Department published a review, setting out the implementation status of the 91 actions in the National Biodiversity Plan, and copies of the review are available in the Oireachtas Library. This indicated that 83 of the actions had either been fully implemented or that implementation was ongoing.  Out of the 91 actions in the Plan my Department has lead or partial responsibility for the implementation of 58 actions. Of these, 55 have either been fully implemented or implementation is ongoing. My Department is currently coordinating the preparation of a new National Biodiversity Plan, which will cover the five-year period 2008 &mdash; 2012.  A public consultation process has taken place and the content of the Plan is being developed in association with other Government Departments.  My Department is also working with the Biodiversity Stakeholders Forum, which operates as a Standing Committee of Comhar (the National Sustainable Development Council), who are providing independent input into the development of the Plan.  As part of the process for developing the new Plan, a further review of the status of implementation of each of the 91 actions in the current plan is underway and my Department is consulting other relevant Government Departments in this regard. These actions will be included and continued, as appropriate, in the new Plan.</P>

	<P>I fully support the case for introducing sustainability criteria into the proposal to amend the Fuel Quality Directive 98/70/EC.  The cultivation of biofuels can have wide ranging environmental, economic and social impacts, including on biodiversity, on the price of food crops and on communities competing for land with commercial biofuel interests, while actual net emission reductions from the use of biofuels will depend on a range of factors including type of cultivation, conservation process and fuels used.  An EU Ad hoc Working Party on Sustainability Criteria for biofuels has been established with the aim of agreeing suitable text, for purposes of both the proposed Directive on promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, and the proposed Directive amending the 1998 Fuel Quality Directive.  Development of the text is ongoing and Ireland is represented on this Working Party by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the importance of the arrangements provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 whereby eligible persons due to transfer to the Rental Accommodation Scheme [RAS] can return to full-time employment or take up a training position and continue to remain eligible for rent supplement.  It is a matter for individual housing authorities, in this case Dublin City Council, to consider how best to implement the arrangements. The Council has advised my Department that it continues to accept new applicants and where this involves rent supplement recipients returning to work special measures are in place between the City Council and the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Community Welfare Division to fast-track applications for RAS.  The Council has undertaken to assess a person&rsquo;s eligibility for RAS within seven working days and inform the Community Welfare Division.  These arrangements ensure that applicants can avail fully of the provisions of Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007.</P>

	<P>Under the social housing reform agenda, as set out in the Government&rsquo;s Housing Policy Statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, there is a commitment to the reform of housing allocation policy.  Proposals for a new allocation policy have been developed by my Department in consultation with the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association, and have been discussed and endorsed by the Housing Forum.  The aims of the policy reforms are to improve consistency and transparency in decision making, to provide a better fit between needs and resources and to respond, as far as possible, to the expressed preferences of individual households.  Legislative provision to underpin the reforms, which it is envisaged will involve the replacement of section 11 of the Housing Act 1988, will be included in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is currently being drafted and is expected to be published during the present D&aacute;il session.</P>
        <P>A revised scheme of letting priorities for Dublin City Council was submitted to my Department in February 2008.  The terms of the revised scheme are currently under consideration.  I expect to make a decision on the scheme shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Quality customer service has been a key pillar of the local government modernisation programme over the past decade.  Significant progress has been made by local authorities in service delivery under the programme and this has been confirmed by the Performance Verification Group for the local government sector under the National Partnership arrangements. Substantial support and resources have been provided by my Department to local authorities on specific initiatives in this regard.  These include &euro;31 million to support a one-stop-shop programme, making access to services and information easier and more efficient for customers.  In addition, a further &euro;9.8 million has been provided to improve efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery through the use of information technology.  Many local authority services are now more accessible on-line, including planning and motor tax.</P>
        <P>As part of the modernisation programme, a Local Government Customer Service Group, representative of my Department, the local government sector at both elected member and official level, and the Institute of Public Administration, was put in place to develop and promote specific customer service initiatives.    A number of initiatives have been brought forward by this group, including the introduction of local authority service indicators, under which authorities report annually to me as Minister on their performance across 42 indicators.  The indicators, which were a first for the public service, are quality-assured by an Independent Assessment Panel.  The Local Government Customer Service Group has recently completed a review of the indicators, resulting in a number of additions and amendments, to apply from 2008.  The group has also issued separate guidelines to local authorities on best practice in handling customer complaints and engaging in customer consultation.</P>
        <P>Looking further ahead, a high-level Task Force on Customer Service, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and on which my Department and the local government sector are represented, was established in September 2007.  This Task Force is charged with promoting quality customer service across the entire public service, including local government.  Quality customer service will also be a cornerstone of the forthcoming Green Paper on Local Government reform and in this context I am looking forward to constructive comments and suggestions on how quality customer service in local authorities can be further improved.  In the meantime, I want to acknowledge the progress made by local authorities and to assure the House that I am committed to ensuring that local authorities continue to intensify their efforts in this most important area.</P>

<P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">The training was held in 1997 and the total cost was &pound;11,050. Participants in both training programmes received five days training. The third day of the Management Development training programme focused on leadership and delegation.  The other training days focused on business planning, objective setting, negotiation skills, management and planning. The money paid to OMT reflects the cost of both training programmes, and as such, it is not possible to give an exact price for the &lsquo;leadership&rsquo; element of the programmes.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that no areas or functions have been devolved from me to a State or statutory agency.  The Central Statistics Office (CSO), which operates under the aegis of my Department, is a statutorily independent body and performs its functions in accordance with the Statistics Act, 1993.  Section 13 of the Act provides that the Director General of the CSO shall have the sole responsibility for, and be independent in the exercise of, the functions of deciding (a) the statistical methodology and professional statistical standards used by the Office; (b) the content of statistical releases and publications issued by the office; and (c) the timing and methods of dissemination of statistics compiled by the Office.  However, Parliamentary Questions on matters of public interest relating to the work of the CSO are answered on my behalf by Tom Kitt T.D., Minister of State at my Department.  Under the Statistics (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order, 2007, the powers and duties conferred on me by or under the Statistics Act, 1993, the Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1956 to 2005 and the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004, in so far as those Acts relate to the CSO, are delegated to Minister of State Kitt.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available.  Statistics on employment and unemployment are measured  by the Quarterly National Household Survey.  The survey provides estimates for eight NUTS-3 level regions.  The latest results are for the period September to November 2007 and showed an unemployment  figure  of  30,100 persons in the Dublin region. This equates to an unemployment rate in the Dublin region of 4.6%.</P>
        <P>The Live Register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming Jobseekers Benefit, Jobseekers Allowance and other registrants as registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Figures are published for each county and each Local Social Welfare Office.   The most recent information is for March 2008.  The Live Register figure for the Tallaght Local Office in Dublin in March 2008 was 4,456 persons.  It should be noted that <Col N="555"/>the Live Register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance.  The exact area covered by each Local Office is not limited to the immediate locality, or county, of the particular office.  For instance, in the Tallaght Local Office there may be registered persons from the Blessington area.</P>

	<P>Significant progress has been made on a number of fronts, including eGovernment, since the publication of &ldquo;New Connections&rdquo;, the last action plan for the Information Society. Work is ongoing on the development of the new Plan which will</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />take account of considerable developments since the last plan</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />detail the arrangements to monitor progress on the Plan.</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0">As with previous such plans, the work is being coordinated by the Information Society Policy Unit, in the Department of the Taoiseach, who are taking inputs from other Government Departments and Offices and who will be working with the eStrategy Group of Secretaries General on the detailed provisions of the plan, prior to its presentation to Government for approval.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to technology in government, the new plan will take account of the very positive impacts on public service delivery that have already been made in the many very successful projects. It will also have regard to the recommendations of the C&amp;AG&rsquo;s Special Report on e-Government along with the forthcoming OECD Review of the Public Service in Ireland. The plan will also reflect the changing focus on the use of technology in government towards a more demand-led approach, based on the requirements to improve performance across all areas of the public service in service delivery and internal administration.</P>

        <P el="0">Total Expenditure on advertising by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in the years from 2003 to 2007 amounted to just under &euro;1.9m. The annual distribution of this expenditure and the advertising medium used is set out in the tables beneath.  The vast bulk of this expenditure &mdash; over 94% &mdash; relates to two statistical activities, the 2006 Census of Population and the Household Surveys i.e. cyclical Household Budget Survey and the Quarterly National Household Survey.  The 2006 Census of Population public awareness and staff recruitment campaigns cost &euro;1.55m.  The Census involved the recruitment of approximately 5,000 field and temporary HQ staff, and a public awareness campaign designed to promote the active participation of all people resident in the State on Census night.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Quarterly National Household Survey, introduced in 1997, provides estimates of employment and unemployment within three months of the end of each quarter.  It has also become a key source of statistics on social topics, with the incorporation of different modular topics. It is an on-going survey with respondents being added and removed on a rolling cyclical basis.  Respondents participate in the survey for 5 quarters.  Each quarter, a percentage of the respondents are replaced by new participants.  The survey is conducted by the CSO&rsquo;s permanent field staff and focused local advertising is used to ensure that respondents, in particular new respondents, are aware that an official survey is taking place in their area and the statistical benefits of participation.  The remaining expenditure on advertising relates to a variety of items, the main one being the annual cost of the State Directory &mdash; &ldquo;the green pages&rdquo; &mdash;  section in telephone directories.</P>

        <P el="10">(6) <i>The National Forum on Europe</i></P>
        <P el="0">National Forum On Europe was established by the Government and the political parties in 2001 to facilitate discussion on Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union and to debate the future of Europe.  Its members are the political parties and groupings represented in the Oireachtas as well as a Special Observer Pillar of civil society organisations. The Forum does not advocate or promote any particular course of action but provides a neutral space in which all views and analyses can be heard. The Forum has engaged in advertising, primarily to support its programme of meetings, particularly its Plenary meetings in Dublin. This year, the Forum is playing a leading role in facilitating debate in the run-up to the referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon (EU Reform Treaty) to be held in June. It is carrying out an advertising campaign in support of its plenary meetings and a series of public information meetings which it is organising around the country.</P>

	<P>My Department was responsible for managing the M.Sc (Management) Public Sector Programme for senior managers in the civil service delivered by the University of Dublin, Trinity College, in association with the Irish Management Institute. The programme, launched in 1993, was run over two years and modular in content. It was specifically designed to enhance the capacity and capability of senior managers to meet the management and policy challenges confronting the civil and public service emerging under the Strategic Management Initiative, including the promotion of strategic leadership thinking. In 1997 there were 9 participants from the civil service on the programme, including one senior official from my Department. The overall cost of the programme for the period in question was &euro;67,709 (&pound;53,325). </P>

        <Quest> if it is possible for a person on maternity benefit to also receive the home carer&rsquo;s tax credit for the period they were off work after giving birth. </Quest>

	<P>Qualification for the home carer tax credit, which was increased from &euro;770 to &euro;900 in Budget 2008, does not depend on an individual&rsquo;s situation over a specific short-term period but instead depends on whether specific conditions apply in the tax year in which the credit is claimed. The home carer tax credit can be claimed by a married couple who are jointly assessed to income tax and where one spouse is a &ldquo;home carer&rdquo; for the relevant tax year.  A &ldquo;home carer&rdquo; is an individual who is engaged during the tax year in caring for one or more dependent persons. The definition of &ldquo;dependent person&rdquo; includes a child for whom social welfare child benefit is payable.</P>
        <P>However, a married couple cannot claim both the home carer tax credit and the increased standard rate band for married couples with two incomes in the same tax year.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in practice they will grant the couple whichever tax treatment is more beneficial to them.  The home carer can have total income in her or his own right of up to &euro;5,080 without this affecting the married couple&rsquo;s entitlement to claim the home carer tax credit.  If the home carer&rsquo;s income is between &euro;5,080 and &euro;6,880, the credit is reduced by one half of the excess over &euro;5,080.  If the home carer&rsquo;s income exceeds &euro;6,880, the credit cannot be claimed.  For the purpose of this income limit, carer&rsquo;s allowance and maternity benefit paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs are ignored.</P>

	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for the policy and the legislative framework governing elections.  Returning Officers are statutorily responsible for conducting the polls.  I, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, have no direct role in the running of elections. However, I sanctioned a Schedule of Charges (Charges Order) which set out the scale of maximum charges for Returning Officers for the purpose of the General Election which was held on 24 May 2007.  Section 32 of the Electoral Act 1992, as amended by Section 14 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, sets out the statutory basis for the payment of expenses to Returning Officers in respect of D&aacute;il elections. The Act allows for payments to Returning Officers in advance of the Election.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;780,000 was advanced to the Wicklow Returning Officer at her request to assist her in making the necessary arrangements for the holding of the 2007 D&aacute;il Election.  The account is now being finalised with a total claim of &euro;434,235.88 which means a repayment of &euro;345,764.12 to the Exchequer is being requested.  A sum of &euro;428,797.21 was advanced to the Wexford Returning Officer.  This account is now being finalised with a total claim of &euro;386,526.06.  The Returning Officer has already repaid &euro;36,306.79 to the Exchequer and is being requested to repay the balance of &euro;5,964.36.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) under which the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being implemented.  The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over &euro;500m in 2008.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</P>
        <P>The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme was introduced on 1st January 2008 with an allocation of &euro;154.2 million over 3 years.  The Scheme will continue to support community-based childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Community childcare services will qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The parent profile of each service, and the amount of subvention it will receive, are determined on the basis of completed parent declaration forms which they return as part of the application process.  The subvention received by services is, in turn, reflected in reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme provides an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The subvention to services is responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage and the ceiling for funding <Col N="588"/>which existed under the previous scheme has been removed.  Account is also being taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones which, in some cases, were previously inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.  In addition, transitional arrangements have been put in place to facilitate community services which were funded under the previous scheme to adjust to the new arrangements, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  This will mean that community services which were funded under the previous scheme and which continue to operate, are guaranteed at least 95% of their 2007 grant aid in 2008.</P>
        <P>When I announced the framework for the new scheme in July of last year, I signalled my intention to undertake a review of the Scheme on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which was to be forwarded to my Office in October 2007 as part of the application process of the new scheme.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the review was completed and the following adjustments were made to the scheme in December:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the childcare subvention rates, which form the basis for assessing the level of grant funding payable to community childcare services, have been increased from &euro;80 to &euro;100 per week in the case of Band A parents and from &euro;30 to &euro;70 per week in the case of Band B parents;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />services will also be grant aided to enable them to provide reduced childcare fees for parents in Band C who are marginally above the Family Income Supplement (FIS) threshold and low income parents who qualify under this measure will benefit by &euro;45 per week per full-time place;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />where a parent moves to a lower Band (e.g. from social welfare into employment), the subvention paid in respect of them will be withdrawn on a tapered basis with the effect that where a parent would no longer qualify for a Band A payment, he or she will be treated as a Band B parent in the following year;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />special provisions will be provided for in the case of childcare services where, for valid reasons, it is not possible to assess grant funding on the basis of annual parental declarations alone (e.g. women&rsquo;s refuges, special services for children of drug misusers) and, in exceptional cases, where special levels of funding provision may be required;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />in recognition of the on-going input of the community and voluntary sector, and to provide stability for services which would otherwise receive very low levels of grant subvention (e.g. small rural services) a minimum annual grant level of &euro;20,000 has been introduced.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />as a transitional measure during 2008-2010, services which could otherwise face a significant decrease in their existing level of grant support from July 2008, will continue to receive grant aid equal to not less than 90% of their previous grant level during July-December 2008, equal to not less than 85% of that amount in 2009, and equal to not less than 75% of that amount in 2010.  The transitional grant funding is conditional on all requirements of the Scheme being complied with, including the return of annual applications together with completed parent declaration forms and the implementation of tiered fees based on the subvention levels for Band A, B and C parents.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The changes which have been introduced will ensure that the most affordable childcare is available to families according to their means.  Put simply, the tiered fee structure is the most <Col N="589"/>effective way of ensuring that the considerable and ongoing Government support for the community childcare sector, will be targeted at those who need it most.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that, with an allocation of &euro;154.2 million over a 3 year period for the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme, the Government is continuing to offer very generous support to this important sector of Ireland&rsquo;s childcare infrastructure.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased to advise the Deputy that the Childcare Directorate of my Office is in the course of notifying services of their individual grant levels for July-December 2008 and that it is anticipated that this process will be completed early next month.  I am confident that the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme is a fair and equitable way of supporting community childcare operators in the provision of an affordable and high quality service to parents, based on their means.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148, 163, 172 and 178 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health Service Executive (HSE) have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, with a view to seeking value for money in the State&rsquo;s drugs bill, in order to better fund existing and innovative therapies without compromising patient safety or continuity of supply. The Government  supports the HSE&rsquo;s decision to pay an 8% mark-up from 1 March, and 7% from 1 January 2009 which will be applied by reducing the reimbursement price paid to community pharmacy contractors from those dates.  I would point out that the new reimbursement arrangements for wholesale supply, announced by the HSE on 17th September 2007, followed the completion of a consultation process, and were informed by the independent economic analysis <Col N="590"/>carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. The report by Indecon was published by the HSE on 13 November 2007. All aspects of the Indecon report were considered by the HSE in making its determination.</P>
        <P>In response to demands from community pharmacists to address the alleged impact of the new wholesale pricing arrangements, the HSE has offered a voluntary interim contract with a flat rate dispensing fee of not less than &euro;5 for all dispensing under the GMS and community drugs schemes. I have also established an Independent Body to assess an interim, fair community pharmacy dispensing fee to be paid for the medical card scheme, the DPS and other community drug schemes. This Body is being chaired by Mr Sean Dorgan, former Head of IDA Ireland. It has been asked to make its recommendations by the end of May 2008.  Both the HSE as the contracting body and the IPU as the representative organisation for community pharmacists, along with other stakeholders, will be entitled to make submissions to the Independent Body.</P>
        <P>Based on its consideration of submissions received and its own independent evaluation, the body will recommend an appropriate dispensing fee that would, in its view, represent a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the pharmaceutical service currently being provided by community pharmacists to the HSE under the GMS and community drug schemes. If approved by Government, it will be backdated to the date from which any individual community pharmacist may choose to avail of the HSE&rsquo;s offer. I have been informed by the HSE that it has, to date, received notification from 400 community pharmacy contractors indicating their intention to either cease providing services from 1st May 2008, or otherwise reserving their right to do so.</P>
        <P>Community pharmacy contractors are required under the terms of their contract to give three months notice of their intention to withdraw. The HSE has written to each of the 400 contractors, seeking formal confirmation of their intentions and pointing out that 3 months notice of cessation of service is required. At this point in time, only two contractors have actually given formal notification of termination in accordance with the requirements in the contract.  The HSE has developed a national contingency planning framework which will inform and provide direction to local operational management for the development of local area-specific contingency plans. As service provision, geographical and demographic circumstances will vary from area to area, each local health area is developing its own area-specific contingency plan within the context of the overall national framework.  Threats of withdrawal from the community pharmacy contract are unjustified and are not in anyone&rsquo;s interest.  I do not wish to see any patient inconvenienced in any way and expect community pharmacists to fulfil their professional obligations under the terms of their contracts.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In recent years there have been significant improvements to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed.  Assessment is based on a person&rsquo;s and, where relevant, his/her spouse&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.  In June 2006, I  increased the qualification threshold for the GP visit card to 50% above that for a medical card.  Furthermore, under the assessment guidelines, persons whose weekly incomes are derived solely from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE payments, even if these exceed the stated threshold, qualify for a medical card. The Programme for Government commits to the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Indexing the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Doubling of the income limit eligibility of parents of children under 6 years of age, and trebling them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible. As part of this exercise, a review of the assessment criteria for medical cards in the context of financial, medical and social need is being undertaken and is expected to be completed by autumn 2008.  When that review is completed, it is my intention to consider how best to progress the commitments in the Programme for Government in relation to medical card eligibility.</P>

	<P>The harmful effects of exposure to cigarette smoke are well known as is the fact that such exposure is particularly dangerous in enclosed spaces (including motor cars). Parents and others with responsibility for the welfare of children have a particular responsibility to ensure that such exposure does not take place. While I have no proposals to introduce a ban on smoking in cars in which children under 16 years of age are being transported I will keep the matter under review.  Although exemptions apply in psychiatric institutions which are also places of work, it should be noted that an exemption does not constitute a right to smoke, and employers are still bound by a duty of care under Health &amp; Safety legislation to protect their employees. Employers and managers with responsibility for exempted premises are advised to review their policies with a view to eliminating exposure where possible and, at the very least, to minimise exposure to environmental health smoke.</P>

	<P>As part of the Multi-Annual Investment Programme 2006-2009 under the Disability Strategy, the Government provided the Health Service Executive with an additional &euro;75m in both 2006 and 2007.  This funding included monies to provide new and enhanced services for people with disabilities, to implement Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, which came into effect on June 1st 2007 for the under 5&rsquo;s and also for the continuation of the implementation of the transfer of persons with intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.  The Government is also honouring its promise in relation to the Multi-Annual Investment Programme for people with disabilities, with a further &euro;50m investment which was announced in the 2008 Budget.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s specific question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I have had a number of meetings with cystic fibrosis patients attended by the Health Service Executive where the issue of infection control for patients was discussed. I also meet regularly with the CEO and the Chairman of the HSE where various matters of importance are discussed, including the issue of infection control.  I identified the need to improve services for persons with cystic fibrosis as a priority in the Estimates process over recent years.  Since 2006, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.78m has been allocated to the HSE to develop services for patients with cystic fibrosis.  I also asked the HSE to place a particular focus on the development of services at the National Adult Tertiary Referral Centre at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, where concerns had been raised regarding the need to improve facilities.  A number of capital projects have been completed at the hospital and further developments are in progress.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, a new ward block is to be built at St. Vincent&rsquo;s which will include 120 replacement beds in single en-suite accommodation. The new facility will accommodate cystic fibrosis patients and will include appropriate isolation facilities.  The HSE advises that planning permission has been obtained, financial provision has been included in the HSE Capital Plan and the contract is to be awarded in 2008.  It will be a condition of the contract that the design build period be no more than 24 months from the date of contract award.  In the interim, work is underway on the refurbishment of  accommodation to provide eight single en-suite rooms for patients with cystic fibrosis.  The project is due to be completed over the coming months.  On completion of this first phase work will commence to further increase the number of single rooms for patients with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>The HSE advises that patients with cystic fibrosis will also benefit from additional single room capacity in the new medical admissions unit at Beaumont Hospital which is due to open in December.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the operational issues raised in the question.</P>

	<P>I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has received correspondence from and on behalf of the person concerned, seeking funding for clinical trials for children with duchenne muscular dystrophy.  I wish to assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the situation for the families with children suffering from this condition.  I am also aware of their hopes regarding a proposed trial of IV Exon skipping therapy by the MDEX consortium in the United Kingdom.  I believe that this trial is one of a number of related trials on different Exon skipping therapies being planned in different centres.</P>
        <P>It is very positive that Muscular Dystrophy Ireland has secured access for Irish children to the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy registry in the United Kingdom so that they can be considered for inclusion in the first systematic trial of this treatment.  With regard to the request for direct Irish Government funding for the trial, there is no mechanism or budget for Government funding to the U.K. health research.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may wish to know that while the main emphasis will continue to be on providing supports that help older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, additional long-stay residential places will be required in the coming years to meet the needs of an ageing population. In 2006, the HSE, in conjunction with Prospectus, undertook a Needs Assessment of bed capacity requirements in the areas of long-stay, dementia specific and respite care beds. This report was submitted to the Department of Health and Children in September 2006. While the report indicates a small national surplus of long-stay beds, it also notes that this surplus masks the uneven distribution of beds between and within regions. In particular, HSE Dublin North East and HSE South have an immediate requirement for additional beds. This shortage is being addressed by the Executive.</P>
        <P>I would like to advise the Deputy that the public fast-track initiative provides for 860 new public beds. This process commenced in 2007 and will continue  throughout 2008 and 2009. In addition to the capacity building on the public side, the Deputy may wish to be aware that during the period from 2005 to 2007 the Health Service Executive secured 1,995 private contract beds. A further 200 private contract beds have been made available in the early part of 2008.</P>

	<P>Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.

	<P>On the 4th March 2008, I asked the Board of the Health Service Executive to immediately adopt an interim serious incident management protocol which would incorporate key commitments to patients.  I also asked the Board to engage closely with this issue through its Risk Management Committee until it is satisfied that serious incidents of this nature are being managed to the required standard and to designate one person at national level to ensure that any future reviews are conducted in accordance with the protocol.  At its meeting of the 13th March the Board adopted an interim Policy and Procedures for Serious Incident Management which had been developed by their management in conjunction with their Risk Committee.  The Chief Executive Officer of the HSE has appointed a senior official to take responsibility at national level for the immediate implementation of this Policy and Procedures for Serious Incident Management.  He will be reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer in relation to this matter and in respect of all existing reviews/investigations into serious incidents.</P>
        <P>The HSE recently published a formal guidance document on residential facilities for children with an intellectual disability, and will do so in respect of adults during 2008.

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has designated University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE Western Region, which includes Sligo.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo General Hospital.  In this context, chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.  Cancer day care units, including at Sligo General Hospital, will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients as close to home as possible.</P>
        <P>The decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  Professor Tom Keane, Director of the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Control Programme, is currently engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the orderly phased transfer of services between locations.  The key objective of the National Cancer Control Programme is to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient mortality and survival irrespective of geography.  This will involve significant re-alignment of cancer services to move from the present fragmented system of care to one which is consistent with international best practice in cancer control.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have not had a specific meeting with the HSE in relation to cancer services in Sligo General Hospital.  However, I have had meetings with Professor Keane in relation to the overall implementation of the National Cancer Control Programme. I understand that Minister of State Brendan Smith has had one meeting in relation to cancer services in Sligo. Minister of State Pat the Cope Gallagher has had three meetings regarding services in the North West, including Sligo. Minister of State Jimmy Devins, in his capacity as TD for Sligo-North Leitrim has met numerous delegations both formally and informally in relation to cancer services in Sligo. Minister of State M&aacute;ire Hoctor has not had any meetings in relation to cancer services in Sligo.</P>

	<P>Persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services qualify for a medical card, which entitles them to a range of health services free of charge.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  The assessment of eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged 70 and over, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).  The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

An additional &euro;157 million has been allocated for larger integrated childcare services many of which also provide out of school places.  Of these, &euro;52 million is for services within RAPID and CL&Aacute;R areas.  To end December 2007, approx. &euro;415 million has been approved for Community Based Groups in capital and staffing funding under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP).  Of this approx. &euro;158 million has been allocated to RAPID and CL&Aacute;R areas.  As the majority of projects offer an integrated service it is not possible to break down the amount of funding spent on each element of the service.  However it is estimated that 40% of Community Groups funded under the EOCP provide out of school services.</P>

	<P>The EU Commission decision referred to by the Deputy related to restructuring aid for firms in difficulty granted by the French Government.  The EU Commission, inter alia, decided that the notified restructuring aid constituted aid incompatible with the Treaty and that the aid must be recovered with interest.  It is not the practice in Ireland to subsidise international shipping routes.  I am informed that a commercial examination of the Cork Swansea route has been carried out for the Port of Cork Company.  This indicated that, subject to procuring a suitable vessel, the service could be feasible on a year round basis.  As Minister for Transport, I feel it is important that the market offers a diverse range of maritime links into and out of the State.  This is necessary to facilitate trade and tourism.  I hope that a commercially viable service can be resumed as soon as possible.</P>

        <Quest> the reason a service (details supplied) failed to obtain a bus operating licence under the Road Transport Act 1932; if he is aware of other operators competing on that route; the criteria by which licences are awarded for such routes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, provides the statutory basis for regulating the provision of public bus services by private bus operators.  In accordance with the legislation, private bus operators apply to my Department for licences to operate scheduled bus passenger services within the State.  Section 11 of the Act establishes specific criteria for the determination of applications, which provide that</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The service is required in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Whether the service is sufficient in terms of frequency and duration to meet the requirements of the public</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Whether the applicant has the organisation and equipment necessary to carry out the service</P><Col N="614"/>
<P FLI="0" el="5">Failure to meet the test established by reference to those criteria will result in the refusal of an application.</P>
        <P>Applications for annual licences are generally dealt with on a first come, first served basis.  The presence of a prior application for a licence from another private operator, or a notification from Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann for services on a similar route, necessitates that the consideration of any subsequent application must be held in abeyance until the prior application/notification has been determined.  In the case of the application referred to by the Deputy, on the 20 February 2007, my Department received an application from the operator concerned, for a licence to operate bus passenger services between Dalkey and Dublin Airport.  At that time, my Department advised the applicant that the application was being held until such time as a decision on a prior application for services on a similar route from another private operator had been determined.  This prior application has been finalised and the licence has issued.  My Department understands from the licence holder that some services have now been introduced.</P>
        <P>In the case of the service referred to by the Deputy, on the 16 July 2007 my Department was made aware that the operator concerned had commenced the operation of an unlicensed bus passenger service between Dalkey and Dublin Airport.  My Department immediately contacted that Company and advised that failure to cease the operation of the service in respect of which a licence had not been issued under the Road Transport Act 1932, is an offence under section 7 of that Act.  As the unauthorised service continued to operate my Department advised the Company that the matter was being passed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its investigation.  This matter is currently the subject of an ongoing Garda investigation.</P>

        <Quest> the funding or financial support given by his Department to an agency, body, community, religious or other group or organisation, in the United States for each year since 2000 to date in 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 and 243 together. </P>
        <P>Apart from the funding provided to U.S. based international organisations, such as the United Nations, and emergency aid granted, for example, to the American Red Cross to support displaced communities in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Department has provided ongoing financial support to organisations engaged in the delivery of services to Irish emigrants in the United States since 1989 (see Table 1).  Until recently this funding has been concentrated solely on the support of Immigration Centres that provide advice and assistance to Irish citizens.  The centres and immigration lobby groups are located in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Maryland, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle and Washington DC. We have also provided funding for the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres, a coordination and umbrella body for the centres&rsquo; activities.</P><Col N="615"/>
        <P>Following the publication of the Task Force on Policy regarding Emigrants, my Ministerial predecessor, Brian Cowen T.D., announced the establishment of a dedicated Unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Irish Abroad Unit.  This Unit now administers the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme, which provides financial support to organisations in the voluntary sector engaged in the delivery of services to Irish emigrants, particularly to the more vulnerable and marginalised members of our community abroad.  Since the establishment of the Irish Abroad Unit, the Government has considerably increased the funding available to support emigrant services worldwide, with Government funding to organisations in the United States increasing from $356,000 in 2003 to $2,149,815 in 2007.  While the emphasis of this funding continues to be on supporting the welfare, information and immigration advisory services provided by the Immigration Centres, the progressive increases have allowed the Programme to expand and include a number of capital projects, as well as projects which foster a greater sense of identity and belonging within the Irish community, including culture, heritage and sports projects.</P>
        <P>The Government has also provided substantial financial support to the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, which augments the Government&rsquo;s sustained contact with the US Administration and both Houses of Congress and contributes to our broad based efforts to promote US immigration reform and thereby resolve the status of the undocumented Irish.  Following the dissolution of the Cultural Relations Committee in February 2005, the Consulates and the Embassy have received annual allocations for the promotion and advancement of Irish arts and culture. This programme is administered by the Department&rsquo;s Cultural Division.  Details of the amounts allocated to each of the Missions are provided in Table 2.  No discretionary funds have been allocated either to the Consulates or the Embassy for the support of non Irish emigrant groups.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 to 230, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am deeply concerned by the situation in Tibet, and deplore the loss of life there. In addressing events in Tibet, I have sought, both through my own statements as well as through my Department&rsquo;s ongoing contacts with the Chinese authorities, both in Dublin and Beijing, to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />urge all sides to exercise the maximum restraint, and to underline the importance Ireland attaches to the right of freedom of expression and peaceful protest;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />urge the Chinese authorities to allow greater access by the media and independent observers to Tibet in order to facilitate an assessment of what has been happening there;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />establish from the Chinese authorities what has happened to the protesters, including those who had surrendered to the authorities, as well as seeking assurances of their well-being and the release of imprisoned peaceful protesters;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />encourage dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama, which I believe remains the only sustainable way of   ensuring the preservation of Tibetan religious and cultural identity, as well as addressing Chinese concerns regarding its territorial integrity.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My meeting with the Chinese Ambassador on 16 April provided the most recent opportunity to address these issues.  In so far as my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government expressed his serious concern about the situation in Tibet and appealed for dialogue between the Chinese authorities and representatives of the Dalai Lama, he was reflecting the stance that has also been taken by the Government.  We discussed these points briefly when he raised with me on 11 April the fact that he would include a reference to Tibet in his address to the Green Party Conference the following day.  Finally, I would note that the Government&rsquo;s concerns regarding human rights in China are raised on a regular basis in bilateral contacts with the Government of China.  In these discussions, we continue to raise issues regarding the practice of religion, freedom of expression and the preservation of cultural identity in Tibet.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am aware of the plight of child headed households in Rwanda and find the courage and resilience of the children and young people described in The Irish Times article &ldquo;Orphans of genocide rear themselves in village of children&rdquo; deeply moving.  The challenges of access to education, health and employment are heavy burdens for all such young people.  Fourteen years after the genocide in Rwanda, when more than 800,000 innocent people lost their lives, the country is still coming to terms with the aftermath of that horror.</P>
        <P>Ireland continues to provide significant support to the people of Rwanda as they work to rebuild their country.  Since 2006 Ireland has provided humanitarian and development assistance of over &euro;7 million to the people of Rwanda.  This funding is channelled through non-governmental organisations such as Irish NGOs Tr&oacute;caire and Concern who are doing such good work on the ground.  We have also funded the work of the UN World Food Programme (WFP) as it seeks to provide emergency food to those most in need.  Our assistance to such work will continue.</P>

	<P>Non governmental organisations (NGOs) are important partners for Irish Aid in the delivery of the aid programme. NGOs in receipt of funding are closely monitored with a view to ensuring full accountability for all monies disbursed. Where issues of concern arise they are reported to senior management and appropriate action is taken. The immediate action is normally the suspension of further funding until the issue of concern has been investigated.  As suspension of funding is a precautionary procedure, and does not of itself imply wrongdoing by the organisation concerned, it would not be appropriate to divulge detailed information in specific cases, especially as the organisations in question could be unfairly damaged by such information being made public.</P>

	<P>Irish Aid has in place rigorous accounting and audit controls which are essential to ensuring a transparent, effective and high quality programme. Irish Aid programmes are regularly and intensively audited and evaluated by independent audit firms, by Irish Aid&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit and by the independent Audit Committee of the Department. Programmes are evaluated to ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended and in respect of outcomes and value for money.</P>
        <P>My Department currently employs 18 staff in headquarters for the purpose of audit and accounting of Irish Aid. An additional accountant has been recruited and will join the Division on 7 May 2008. A further 30 staff are employed locally by our missions to manage finance, audit and accounting practices in programme countries.  The Irish Aid Programme currently has the capacity to absorb the current level of funding. However, clearly, the question of effective spending and accountability will be key issues as we implement the significant growth in funding projected to 2012.  With this in mind my department is carrying out a major review of the management of the Irish Aid Programme in conjunction with the Department of Finance.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the INTRAC Value for Money Report on Irish Aid support provided from the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund to Tsunami Affected Countries. The conclusion of that report was that &ldquo;Irish Aid made a prompt and appropriate response, and, overall, managed its programme of support in an efficient and effective way. The programme of response has been competently monitored and no cases were found of any funds being wasted.&rdquo;  The Report made a series of 12 recommendations, one of which was &ldquo;Irish Aid should request external evaluations of all programmes to which it is contributing and make all grants of &euro;300,000 and above conditional on such an overall and external programme evaluation being undertaken and submitted.&rdquo; In its management response, Irish Aid &ldquo;concurred with the principle of this recommendation&rdquo; which it described as &ldquo;consistent with the commitments of Irish Aid to evaluation and financial accountability&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In practice, the vast majority of Irish Aid funding from the Emergency Fund is provided through UN Agencies like the World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF and the Red Cross. In 2007 such funding accounted for 92% of the Emergency Fund. All of these agencies conform with the principle of the recommendation in the INTRAC Report in that they have their own robust auditing and evaluation procedures in place for all their donors, including Irish Aid. It is therefore unnecessary, and indeed would involve wasteful duplication, and would be in breach of the principles of Good Humanitarian Donorship (GHD), for a single donor like Irish <Col N="622"/>Aid to commission separate additional audits in respect of each of its funding grants made to these agencies.</P>
        <P>The balance of Irish Aid funding from Emergency Fund is provided through our NGO partners. All emergency related funding proposals submitted by our NGO partners are comprehensively appraised. Under the terms of the contracts agreed with the NGO partners, each NGO is obliged to provide externally audited accounts in addition to regular financial statements on spending. Furthermore, regular progress reports are provided by the organisation. In accordance with the audit requirements for the funding of these projects and programmes, Irish Aid receives audited accounts from the NGOs concerned thus providing the necessary audit assurance that feeds into Irish Aid&rsquo;s overall accountability framework.</P>
        <P>In response to that specific recommendation to which the Deputy refers, all contracts governing Irish Aid&rsquo;s humanitarian funding to its NGO partners will include, regardless of value, clauses defining evaluation requirements and stating the right of Irish Aid to commission an independent evaluation of the project or programme. Specific evaluations will take into account the value and nature of the activities that were funded. These evaluation clauses are in addition to the very specific audit requirements that have always been a standard component of Irish Aid&rsquo;s funding agreements. In addition, an evaluation officer has been deployed within its own Emergency and Recovery Section tasked with the responsibility of devising a rolling programme of evaluations designed to assess the impact and the outcome of programmes, to ensure value for money, and to draw upon lessons learnt which can improve our humanitarian response in the future.</P>
        <P>Listed in an annex, are the number and value of programmes from the Emergency Fund in excess of &euro;300,000 awarded to our NGO partners in the years 2005-2007.  All Irish Aid funding, including projects, programmes, sectors and geographic location, is detailed comprehensively in the Irish Aid Annual Reports.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ireland signed up to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness of March 2005, which, inter alia, agreed to &ldquo;eliminate duplication of efforts and rationalise donor activities to make them as cost effective as possible.&rdquo; In line with this commitment, Irish Aid&rsquo;s programme funding agreements now provide authorisation for the commissioning of joint audit work with other donors in areas of developmental activity which are jointly funded. Where joint arrangements do not exist, such as, for example, where Irish Aid is the only funder of a particular activity, work can be commissioned solely by Irish Aid. It should be noted that in most of Irish Aid&rsquo;s major bilateral programmes, a significant proportion of programme expenditure is the subject of joint audit work.</P>
        <P>The issue of membership of the Harmonisation in Overseas Audit Practices group &mdash; a grouping of the external auditors (Supreme Audit Institutions) of the countries providing overseas aid &mdash; is a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office. Irish Aid, following communications with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, can confirm that Ireland has not yet become a member, but that the Office is in contact with the group and receives updates and communications on the group&rsquo;s work.</P>

	<P>Irish Aid delivers assistance to over 90 countries in the world but has a particularly deep relationship with nine countries termed Programme Countries, seven in Africa and two in Asia. These are Tanzania, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia, Malawi, Vietnam and East Timor. In two of these countries, Mozambique and Tanzania, Irish Aid provides direct budget support as part of a comprehensive programme of development assistance.  Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the developing world is based on partnership and equality. Budget support contributes to greater ownership of development planning by recipient countries, and helps to create the conditions in which they can lead their own development processes. It enables both Government and donors to support national development as a whole, rather than focusing on individual projects or specific sectors.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid attaches the highest priority to ensuring that taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent efficiently and effectively for the benefit of the poor. Decisions on the delivery of direct budget support take account of the performance of partner Governments in key areas such as good governance, respect for human rights, and commitment to addressing the needs of the poor. Where such support is provided, it is accompanied by stringent systems of oversight and accountability.  The fruits of this programmatic approach by Ireland, other donors and recipient countries are beginning to emerge. Africa is experiencing its most rapid period of growth in decades. Poverty levels are falling, not fast enough, but falling nevertheless. Ireland&rsquo;s Programme Countries are among those making real progress. In Mozambique for example the number of primary schools has increased from 2,800 in 1992 to approximately 9,000. Tanzania is making significant progress on child health and education. In Uganda the number of children at school has increased from 2 million to 7 million.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid continues to work in some of the poorest and most difficult operating environments in the world. Like other donors, including NGOs and development agencies, we must strike a balance between risk and making a real and lasting difference in people&rsquo;s lives. I believe that our approach, which combines a range of instruments and partners, including budget support, strikes the right balance and is bringing about positive results amongst the poor.</P>

        <P>These advertising costs include public information campaigns for World AIDS Day and Africa Day, recruitment to Irish Aid and volunteer positions, and the placement of tender notices and information relating to grant application procedures. Advertising costs increased in 2006 and 2007 as a result of significant campaigns around recruitment to the Rapid Response Corps, World AIDS Day and the opening of the Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre.</P>

	<P>A birth certificate is essential to obtain a passport. The Office of the Registrar General has responsibility for records relating to Births, <Col N="627"/>Marriages and Deaths in the State.  The person in question should first contact the Registrar General&rsquo;s Office which will explain the procedure for the late registration of a birth. Once the birth has been registered, the Passport Office will assist in issuing a passport.  The contact details for the Registrar General&rsquo;s Office are: General Register Office, Government Offices, Convent Road, Roscommon. Tel: 090 6632900, LoCall: 1890 252076.  If the person encounters any difficulties with the registration process, he should contact Mrs. Joan Fitzpatrick in the Passport Office in Cork, at 021 4944722, who will be happy to try and be of assistance.</P>

	<P>The Reform Treaty makes a number of minor changes to the Court of Justice of the European Union in relation to procedural aspects and its jurisdiction.  Article 1.20 draws together the key elements of the existing texts on the Court of Justice.  Changes in relation to the Court&rsquo;s procedures include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />establishment of a seven-person panel to offer opinions on the suitability of candidates for judgeships and advocates-generalships;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a shortening of the procedure for imposing fines on Member States;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />greater provision for the use of QMV by the Council in amending less fundamental aspects of the Court&rsquo;s Statute; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a requirement, based on respect for the right to liberty and for the right to a speedy trial, that the Court act with &ldquo;minimum delay&rdquo; in giving preliminary rulings at the request of Member States, where an individual is in custody.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Court will have full jurisdiction in regard to the Treaty&rsquo;s provisions on freedom, security and justice, though it may not review the proportionality or legality of operations carried out by Member States&rsquo; police or other law-enforcement services, or the exercise by the Member States of their responsibilities with regard to the maintenance of law and order and safeguarding internal security. For a transitional period of five years, however, this extended jurisdiction will not apply to existing measures taken in the field of judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation.  It is made clear by the Reform Treaty that the Court continues as a general rule not to have jurisdiction as regards the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Nor will the Court have jurisdiction on issues which remain the responsibility of Member States.</P>

	<P>The Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (2006-2013) recognises the importance for Ireland in building its international collaborative networks in science and highlights the importance of making investments in a way that produces the greatest benefit to Ireland.  Ireland is currently involved in various international programmes and initiatives including the European Seventh Frame<Col N="628"/>work Programme for Research (FP7), the European Space Agency, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, EUREKA, the network for market orientated research and development and COST, European co-operation in the field of scientific and technical research.</P>
        <P>In 2001 a detailed assessment of Irish participation in intergovernmental research organisations, which included CERN, was conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology on my Department&rsquo;s behalf.  While the resulting report to Forf&aacute;s recommended that Ireland should not join CERN at that point, I am cognisant of the need to keep under review developments and opportunities at international and European level and to ensure that our investments assist us to build a strong national research capacity that will attract and retain researchers.  At my request, the Advisory Science Council (ASC) is undertaking a study, on Ireland&rsquo;s International Engagement in Science, Technology and Innovation, which should be completed later this year.  This study will help to guide decision making on the international research organisations in which Ireland should seek closer involvement.   In this regard, it is important to appreciate that decisions about joining international research organisations must take into consideration the opportunity costs involved (membership fees may mean less funding available for research at home) and the capacity of the research community to derive and optimise benefits from such memberships.</P>

	<P>The total number of new jobs created in multinational client companies of IDA Ireland and Shannon Development in the period 1998 to 2007 is 137,864.  The annual breakdown of these figures is set out in tabular statements 1 and 2.  This information is taken from the Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey.  Information on jobs numbers is gathered on a confidential basis for statistical purposes only.  In the period 1998 to 2007 a total of 333 multinational companies set up operations in this country, with assistance from IDA and Shannon Development.  The names of those companies are set out on the tabular statement 3.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2008 there have been 5 announcements relating to new multinational, greenfield start-ups with a potential to create 595 new jobs with IDA support, while in the same period, 9 companies have announced expansions with a potential to create an additional 1,016 jobs.  The names of these companies, together with the location and estimated job numbers that have been announced, are set out in the tabular statements 4 and 5.  It should be noted, however, that jobs announced may take three to five years to come on stream.</P>

	<P>The issue raised by the Deputy relates to Sections 48 and 49 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  My Department launched a public consultation process in relation to the commencement of these provisions of the Act in the summer of 2007.  Although the deadline for receipt of submissions was the 7th September 2007, my Department continued to receive submissions until November, 2007.  A total of almost 50 submissions were received in response to the consultation process. The submissions gave rise to a number of complex matters, requiring careful consideration.  I intend to bring my consideration of these issues to the attention of my Government colleagues shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 and 249 together.</P>
        <P>On 3 April 2008, the European Court of Justice issued a judgement in a case between Mr Dirk R&uuml;ffert, a company liquidator, and Land Niedersachsen, a public authority in Germany.  The background to this case is that a public construction contract was awarded to a German company called Objekt und Bauregie, of which Mr Dirk R&uuml;ffert is the liquidator, by the public authority.  The German company undertook to abide by relevant collective agreements and to ensure that sub-contractors did likewise.  The company engaged a Polish sub-contractor called &lsquo;PKZ Pracownie Konserwacji Zabyt&oacute;w sp. zoo&rsquo; that was subsequently found to be in breach of a collective agreement relating to public sector construction contracts.  The works contract was terminated following a criminal investigation and legal proceedings commenced between the public authority and Mr R&uuml;ffert to determine whether the German company was required to pay a contractual penalty amounting to &euro;849,343 for breach of its undertaking concerning rates of pay.</P>
        <P>The Regional Court held that a contractual penalty of &euro;84,934 applied, but this was appealed to the Higher Regional Court, which referred certain issues to the European Court of Justice.  The European Court of Justice found that the rate of pay provided for in the collective agreement relating to public sector construction contracts was not fixed in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Posted Workers Directive.  The Posted Workers Directive requires a Member State to ensure that a worker posted to its territory from an undertaking in another Member State is guaranteed the terms and conditions of employment, in respect of certain matters, that employees are guaranteed under the law of that Member State.</P>
        <P>The judgement, which issued on 3 April last, is currently being considered by Member States.  It appears that the judgement is quite case-specific and hinged on the failure of the German authorities to give universal application status to the collective agreement, even though pro<Col N="639"/>cedures for doing so existed.  I am satisfied that the transposition of the Posted Workers Directive in Ireland &mdash; through the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001 &mdash; is robust in its protection of the employment rights, including minimum wage requirements, of posted workers in Ireland.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Joan Burton</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> his views on introducing changes to the Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry Pensions Assurance and Sick Pay) 1946 in order to make contributions voluntary or to replace fixed rate contributions with <i>pro rata</i> contributions on the basis of a percentage of wage earned; if he proposes an alternative mechanism for dealing with these issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>An Employment Agreement is an agreement made either between a trade union and an employer or employers organisation or at a meeting of a registered Joint Industrial Council, which relates to the pay or conditions of employment of any class, type or group of workers.  Employment Agreements may be presented to the Labour Court for registration. Where the Labour Court is satisfied that the agreement presented satisfies the statutory requirements, it registers the agreement.</P>
        <P>The Construction Industry (Pension Assurance and Sick Pay) Registered Employment Agreement (REA) requires employers in the construction sector to become and remain a party to a contributory pension scheme approved by the Revenue Commissioners and sets out the conditions upon which pension and mortality payments are payable and the associated minimum amounts and benefits.  The Construction Industry (Pension Assurance and Sick Pay) REA is an agreement reached between employers and trade unions representative of workers in the sector and I have no function in relation to the negotiation of, or changes to, this agreement or any other Registered Employment Agreement.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>If the named person believes that he has been unfairly dismissed he may present a claim of unfair dismissal to either a Rights Commissioner or to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. The Unfair Dismissals Acts apply, with certain exceptions, to employees over age 16 with at least 12 months&rsquo; continuous service.  A claim for unfair dismissal must be submitted within six months of the dismissal.</P>
        <P>The person concerned may also wish to consider whether the termination of his employment is covered by the Redundancy Payments Scheme under which all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant. In general a redundancy situation arises where an employee&rsquo;s job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which administers the Scheme, will then pay the employer a 60% rebate. Where the employer is unable or unwilling to pay the lump sum, the Department may be in a position to pay directly from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).</P>
        <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal may be contacted at Davitt House, 65A Adelaide Road, Dublin 2, telephone: (01) 631 2121 or 1890 220 222 Lo-Call service from outside (01) area.  Any person requiring the assistance of a Rights Commissioner may contact The Secretariat, Rights <Col N="640"/>Commissioners Service, The Labour Relations Commission, Tom Johnson House, Haddington Road, Dublin 4, telephone (01) 613 6700 or 1890 220 227 (callers outside 01 area).  Should the person require further information on employment rights generally he can contact the National Employment Rights Authority Lo-call information line at 1890 80 80 90.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Construction Industry (Pension Assurance and Sick Pay) Registered Employment Agreement (REA) requires employers in the construction sector to become and remain a party to a contributory pension scheme approved by the Revenue Commissioners and sets out the conditions upon which pension and mortality payments are payable and the associated minimum amounts and benefits.   The REA does not specify any  particular pension scheme to apply but rather sets out the general criteria within which any such scheme should operate.</P>
        <P>The Construction Workers Pension Scheme (generally referred to as CWPS) has been established on foot of the Registered Employment Agreement. While it is not a legal requirement for employers and employees in the construction industry to pay into this particular scheme, it is, as already mentioned, a legal requirement that employers provide for pension, mortality and sick benefits for those workers to whom the REA applies. The conditions upon which such pension, mortality and sick pay benefits are payable and the amounts thereof must not be less favourable than those which are set out in the REA.  Enforcement of the provisions of a Registered Employment Agreement may be effected by direct complaint to the Labour Court.  A trade union or an employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a Registered Employment Agreement.  If, after investigating a complaint, the Court is satisfied that an employer is in breach of a Registered Employment Agreement the Court may by order direct compliance with the agreement.  Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.</P>
        <P>I understand that under the Pensions Act 1990, the Pensions Board has power to investigate the state and conduct of Irish Pension schemes so as to ensure that all involved comply with their obligations.  This provides an additional layer of enforcement and protection.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to reform the system whereby apprentices are trained and in which they need to find employment with sponsoring firms; and if in view of the current downturn and the need to prioritise skills education, he will launch an apprenticeship training programme where his Department or the Department of Education and Science will act as sponsors of last resort. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I currently have no plans to reform the apprenticeship system or to alter the present situation where apprentices are employed by sponsoring firms. The key strength of the system is that it is a demand-driven educational and training programme. It is designed to develop the knowledge, skills and competencies of apprentices and to meet the needs of industry and the labour market.  F&Aacute;S has the statutory responsibility for the organisation and control of designated apprenticeship. It operates the Statutory Apprenticeship system in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science, employers and trade unions.  The National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee oversees the development of the standards based process and advises the Board of F&Aacute;S on all matters pertaining to apprenticeship. This committee is made up of representatives of the social partners, the educational sector and F&Aacute;S and has responsibility for ensuring that apprenticeship curricula are up-to-date and meet the needs of industry.</P><Col N="646"/>
        <P>The present structure of the apprenticeship system ensures that individuals, who compete the seven standard based modules, are qualified to meet the needs of industry and have operational experience, as a result of their employment by sponsoring companies. In general I see the present structure of the apprenticeship system being central to the maintenance of its high quality and relevance to industry.  There are no plans at present for either my Department or the Department of Education and Science to provide parallel apprenticeship training programmes or to take on the functions of sponsoring apprentices in the different designated categories.</P>

	<P>The nationwide audit of sports facilities has commenced and is being carried out in stages to help speed up the availability of information.  Phase One, which focuses on national and regional sports facilities, has now been completed within my Department.  Phase Two of the audit, which is a more complex undertaking to establish a record of existing sports facilities at local level and identifying the <Col N="647"/>need for future provision, will be undertaken during 2008 with the assistance of Local Authorities.  Guidelines have now been issued to Local Authorities to assist them in carrying out the audit.</P>
        <P>The audit is part of a wider exercise to put in place a more strategic approach to the provision of sports facilities in Ireland.  Work on the National Sports Facility Strategy is currently underway with the assistance of a firm of consultants involving both national and international experts in the area of sports facilities.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment/grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  It is intended to identify the facilities requirement for sport so that participation at reasonable cost is feasible for those who wish to engage in sport at either amateur or elite level.</P>

	<P>Since the National Museum of Ireland became an autonomous statutory body under the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997 on 3rd May 2005, the Board of the National Museum is statutorily responsible for operational matters concerning its collection and I, as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, do not have a statutory function in respect of those operational matters.  The National Museum is responsible for the care and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s portable heritage, which comprises a vast number and variety of artefacts. As a collecting institution with responsibility for their preservation and conservation as well as their display, it would not be possible for the Museum to place all of the National Collection on display at any given time. However, the Museum has a continuing policy of exhibition development at each of its sites to facilitate greater access to and interpretation of the National Collection.</P>
        <P>The National Museum of Ireland has an on-going practice of facilitating loans to county museums and other such bodies that meet the necessarily stringent requirements of security, safety and public access. This practice has resulted in a number of substantial loans being made to designated county and other museums, including the Kerry County Museum.</P>

	<P>The Early Child care Supplement (ECS) scheme is under the remit of the office of the Minister for Children (OMC); the administration of the scheme is undertaken by the Department of Social and Family Affairs on an agency basis for the OMC.  Under the relevant legislation the ECS payment is automatically made to the person who receives Child Benefit for the child.  Child Benefit section routinely contacts customers to ensure that they continue to meet the conditions for receipt of the benefit and are receiving their full entitlement.  Since late 2007, an automated process has been introduced that issues a residency certification letter to selected groups of customers on a regular periodic basis.</P>
        <P>The person referred to was randomly selected for inclusion in the February issue of the Residency certification letter.  This letter was issued to some 5000 customers and required them <Col N="649"/>to confirm their residency and their children&rsquo;s continued residency in Ireland. The completed form was required to be returned with 21 days. As no reply was received from the person concerned, Child Benefit and Early Child care Supplement payments were suspended.  A copy of the letter has been re-issued to the person concerned, and on its return payment, including any arrears due, will be re-instated assuming the conditions for Child Benefit/ECS continue to be met.</P>

        <Quest> the measures in place to ensure that his Department only pays rent supplement in respect of private rented properties and landlords which meet the requirements of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993 and the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. </Quest>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. There are currently over 61,000 tenants benefiting from assistance under the rental supplement scheme.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with the local authorities. The Community Welfare Service of the HSE is not qualified to undertake this work. However, accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards. Under legislative provisions introduced by my Department in 2006 and 2007, the HSE can decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority regarding non-compliance with housing standards. These provisions support the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government Action Programme which aims to promote further improvement in private rented accommodation standards, including a review of the regulations and more effective enforcement.</P>
        <P>Where a notification of non-compliance with standards is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant, the HSE normally discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant.  The objective is to ensure that substandard accommodation does not come within rent supplementation. The most recent information available from the HSE is that any notifications of substandard accommodation received from local authorities have resulted in rent supplement being terminated or the refusal of rent supplement where it was not already in payment.  The HSE has also provided data to local authorities in relation to all long-term recipients of rent supplement. Over 30,000 cases have been notified to date.  The HSE must be satisfied that accommodation funded under the rent supplement scheme is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant. Where the HSE becomes aware of accommodation or blocks of accommodation which appear to it to be sub-standard, it notifies the local authority and it may advise prospective tenants at that premises that rent supplement will not be paid in respect of those tenancies.</P>
        <P>Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  My Department supports the requirement that all tenancies, including those facilitated by rent supplement, should be registered with the PRTB and is committed to working closely with the PRTB in ensuring that all rent supplemented tenancies comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards.  To that end, my Department provides details of rent supplement payments to the PRTB to enable them identify tenancies that are not registered and to take any follow-up action necessary.  My Department is committed to supporting the Department of the Environment, Heritage <Col N="650"/>and Local Government and the Private Residential Tenancies Board in meeting their responsibilities in relation to housing standards and registration of tenancies respectively.</P>

The HSE advised at that time that no formal decision has been made on entitlement.  The person concerned had been informed that she was unlikely to qualify for rent supplement as her rent was substantially in excess of the rent limits prescribed for a person in her circumstances.   The person was advised that the community welfare officer would consider payment of rent supplement for a short period of time, subject to her sourcing alternative accommodation within the prescribed rent limits.  The Executive has now advised that according to its records, the person concerned has not made contact with the community welfare service to discuss this proposal. </P>

	<P>It is government policy to facilitate the greater use of electronic payment systems in the economy in the interest of developing a world class payment environment in Ireland.  In this context, the National Payments Implementation Program Advisory Group, under the aegis of the Department of An Taoiseach, monitors the growth in electronic payments, the reduction in cash transactions and any new payment mechanisms which come on the market.  My Department is represented on this group.</P>
        <P>The current range of payment options offered by my Department to customers&rsquo; includes payment via local post office, or certain credit unions that have been authorised by the banking and credit union regulators; bank or building society account, including post bank.  Customers opt for a particular payment method having regard to their own personal circumstances.  Currently some 54% of customers receive their payment electronically direct to their bank or financial institution, or by using a Social Services Card at their post office.  The remaining customers are paid by paper-based payment instruments &mdash; cheques, post drafts or personal payment order books.</P>
        <P>The Department is implementing a three-year strategy to move from paper-based payment instruments to electronic payments at financial institutions and to using a Social Services Card at post offices.  The programme is being implemented on a phased basis to coincide with book renewal and as personalised payable order books expire.  The objective of the Department&rsquo;s payment strategy is to ensure that cost effective arrangements are in place for making payments to social welfare customers using a range of payment options and that new payment facilities are made available to customers as they become available.  A range of measures are underway to inform customers of the change in payment methods.  Each customer is being informed by letter of the change in their payment arrangement.  A Social Services Card, along with a covering letter explaining how to use the card, is being issued to them.  An Post and the Irish Postmaster&rsquo;s Union (IPU) are committed to assisting customers in the use of cards for collecting their payment.</P>
        <P>Groups representing a broad range of customers, including the elderly and the disabled, have already been consulted and have indicated that they will support the move to using cards at post offices.  Posters are being displayed in all post offices, citizens information centres and throughout my Departments local office network.

	<P>The principal child-centred income support is child benefit (CB). Others include the increase for a qualified child (IQC), paid in addition to social welfare payments and family income supplement, paid to low-income employees with children. In addition, the early child care supplement also makes a significant contribution to recipient families.</P>
        <P>For a number of years, government policy has been to invest additional resources in child benefit. This policy focus was driven, in part, by the recognition that the loss of IQC&rsquo;s by social welfare recipients on taking up employment could act as a disincentive to availing of work opportunities. In terms of tackling work disincentives, the shift towards child benefit has been <Col N="652"/>significant. For example, in 1994 child benefit represented 29% of the total child income support payment for a four child family and is now 64%. In other words, a family will now only lose 36% of their child income support when a welfare recipient loses entitlement to a primary social welfare payment.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of an earlier Social Partnership agreement the National Economic and Social Council was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement with IQC with a view to creating a single second tier child income support. The commitment to examining such a change was subsequently embodied in the current social partnership agreement, Towards 2016. Dr John Sweeney was commissioned by NESC to examine the issues and develop proposals for a second tier child income support scheme. His research paper on this issue was received towards the end of 2007.</P>
        <P>The broad objectives of the provision of child income supports are to bring about an improvement in the relative overall position of families with children compared with single persons or childless couples and to alleviate child poverty. In considering the future direction of child income support policy, it is important to keep in mind these multiple aims and to maintain the correct balance between child benefit and more selective measures. Dr Sweeney&rsquo;s research paper, which is an important contribution to the debate, is being examined at present.  The Government discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of child care; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.</P>
        <P>Under the proposals, the contingency of lone parenthood would no longer exist. Instead, a new payment would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner), with young children, on low income. This new payment is currently being developed in my Department, taking into account the various issues raised in the consultation process.  As I have stated before, any proposed new payment scheme can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place on the ground by other Departments and Agencies. This is why the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion has been tasked with bringing forward a plan on the key issues of child care, education, training and activation measures. The testing phase of the non-income measures contained in the discussion paper has ended and the outcome of the process is currently being considered in my Department. This will inform the further development of the proposals. I have asked that a number of issues be examined and I hope to bring the matter to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion in the coming months.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement, which is administered on my behalf by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels per county that enable different eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State. The objective of rent limits is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.  Rent limits have been reviewed on four occasions since 2002.</P><Col N="653"/>
        <P>Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels. This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes, including people in low wage employment.</P>
        <P>In January 2007 a review was completed of the maximum levels of rent which a person may incur and still be eligible to receive rent supplement. The purpose of the review was to inform the process of setting new limits, applicable from January 2007 until 30 June 2008. The review included consultation with the HSE, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Central Statistics Office, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and voluntary agencies working in this area.  This process ensures that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country. Arising from the review, rent limits were adjusted upwards, from January 2007, for a number of household types in 14 counties, including Kildare and Wicklow.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding existing limits, the HSE may exceed these rent limits in certain circumstances e.g. where there is special housing need related to exceptional circumstances. The discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.  I have arranged to have the current rent limits reviewed this year for all counties with a view to implementing any revision found to be necessary, from 1 July 2008. As in 2007, a consultative approach is being used to conduct this review.</P>

	<P>The Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist <Col N="654"/>eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Under the legislative provisions governing the scheme, any person seeking a rent supplement must first satisfy the HSE that are in need of accommodation and unable to provide for it from his or her own resources. The HSE has advised that rent supplement was refused in this case as person concerned failed to demonstrate a genuine housing need. The person concerned was advised of the decision in writing and informed of her right of appeal. No appeal has been received to date.</P>

	<P>The Department received notification from the surviving pensioner on 2nd April 2008, via her Solicitor, stating that there had been a change in her circumstances and notifying the Department that she no longer wished to claim or receive State Pension (Non Contributory).  Following receipt of this notification her entitlement to Pension has been revoked and in the circumstances it has not been necessary for a Social Welfare Inspector to visit her in relation to this matter.  The Department has also received payment on 2nd April 2008 in respect of the overpayment owed by the estate of the pensioner&rsquo;s deceased spouse.   A letter has now issued to the Solicitor acting for the estate acknowledging this payment and confirming that the estate has discharged its liability in this matter.</P>

	<P>My Department uses a mix of advertising media including national and provincial newspapers, radio and television, information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots to ensure that people are aware of their social welfare entitlements and are notified about improvements and changes affecting their payments and services.  The amount spent on advertising in any one year is determined by the number of specific advertising campaigns which are undertaken.  The total amount spent by my Department on advertising in 2003 was &euro;287,000.  Most of the advertising expenditure in 2003 arose in connection with general advertising regarding holiday arrangements, staff vacancies and so on at local or branch offices, and the Budget information campaign.</P>
        <P>Advertising expenditure in 2004 was &euro;475,000.  Two information campaigns were undertaken.  The first campaign promoted the Carer&rsquo;s Benefit scheme and the second campaign alerted people coming up to pension age that they should apply for their pension at least three months before they reach pension age.  The total amount spent on advertising in 2005 was over &euro;300,000.  In this year a major information campaign was undertaken on the Respite Care Grant scheme.  In 2006 a total of &euro;997,000 was spent on advertising.  The principle element of the expenditure incurred related to the Family Income Supplement and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Respite Care Grant entitlements awareness campaigns.</P><Col N="655"/>
        <P>In 2007 the total cost of advertising was &euro;1,413,000.  The main advertising campaigns related to the introduction of the All Ireland Free Travel scheme, the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance scheme and the new Half-Rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  In 2008 the cost of advertising to date has been &euro;330,000.  Advertisements have been placed in relation to staff vacancies and inviting submissions and input from the public in relation to the Green Paper on Pensions, on the development of a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy and on the development of my Department&rsquo;s Customer Action Plan and Customer Charter.</P>
        <P>The costs associated with each year are outlined in the table.  There is a Government contract for all newspaper advertising and any production costs are included in the figures given.  Broadcast media is tendered for separately and any production costs in relation to TV and radio are also included in the figures given.  Advertising is a key part of my Department&rsquo;s information strategy to ensure that people are aware of and claim their social welfare entitlements.</P>

        <P>Following receipt of information from the Office of Public Works, it has been confirmed that there are currently 1,870 car parking spaces available to staff of my Department, of which roughly 50% are located in decentralised offices such as Sligo, Letterkenny, Longford, Carrick on Shannon, Dundalk and Waterford. The balance are located in 69 local and regional offices throughout the country.  In most cases, the cost of the facility is included in the annual rent of the premises as paid by the Office of Public Works. However, the specific cost of 432 car parking spaces can be established in the case of 14 Departmental offices, at an annual cost of &euro;451,817 per annum.</P>

        <Quest> the checks his Department carries out to verify the State pension claims of the 37,000 non-resident pensioners; the mechanism to periodically check to ensure that such pensions are not continuing to be paid where a non-resident pensioner may be deceased; and if he will make a statement on the adequacy of such controls. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are currently 246,000 customers in receipt of a State Pension (Contributory).  Of these, some 37, 000 (15%) reside outside the State in some 63 countries.  It is my Department&rsquo;s experience that the death of a State Pension (Contributory) recipient residing abroad is generally notified to the pension section, without delay, either by a spouse, a surviving relative or by a financial institution.  Notifications of customer deaths are received on a daily basis through the customer contact centre, in writing and via e-mail.  Pension payments are stopped on receipt of these notifications and appropriate action initiated.</P>
        <P>My Department has put arrangements in place with a number of foreign institutions to ensure that we are notified when a recipient of state pension (contributory) resident outside the state dies.  In this regard, the Department works in close co-operation with the Department of Social Development in Northern Ireland and the Department of Work and Pensions in the United Kingdom and arrangements are underpinned by a Memorandum of Understanding between these organisations.  Under this agreement, the Ireland and UK authorities explore ways in which data can be exchanged between administrations for control purposes, subject to the provisions of domestic and data protection legislation.  In addition, at the start of each year a mailshot issues to all state pension (contributory) customers resident abroad notifying them of their new pension rate and reminding them to let the Department know of any changes to their circumstances that would affect their entitlements.  Any letters retuned undelivered receive urgent attention.  This process acts as an additional control measure.</P>
        <P>As part of the Department&rsquo;s ongoing control strategy, periodic reviews are undertaken in order to determine customers&rsquo; continuing eligibility for pension.  In this regard the Department has initiated a customer certification process for state pension (contributory) customers resident in Ireland and abroad.  Letters issue to customers for completion and return of a certificate within a specified time.  Follow-up action is taken where no reply is received from the customer or where the letter is returned undelivered.  To this end, some 1,000 letters have issued to State Pension (Contributory) customers.  Of these, 300 were issued to pension recipients resident outside of the State.  It is planned to issue a further 7,000 letters to State Pension (Contributory) <Col N="657"/>customers resident abroad by the end of 2008.  Follow-up action will be taken where no reply is received from the customer or where the letter is returned undelivered.</P>
        <P>A further part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing control strategy is in the form of a control arrangement which has been established with the Australian Centrelink authorities whereby my Department receives a monthly electronic file of deaths where an Irish State pension is in payment.  My Department is represented at a Working Group set up by the European Commission, which is examining EU-wide controls and data-sharing arrangements with the aim of tackling fraud and error across EU states.  My Department is also a member of the Six Nations Group involving Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States of America, which addresses and agrees common approaches on control issues and the sharing of information.</P>
        <P>I am committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them.  I am satisfied that measures are in place to ensure that payments to customers resident outside the State are stopped when they are deceased.  The Department&rsquo;s control programme is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.</P>

	<P>I expect to launch the next National Drugs Strategy &mdash; to cover the period 2009-2016 &mdash; by the end of the year.  In this context, I have established a Steering Group to develop proposals and to make recommendations to me on the new Strategy.  The Steering Group, which is chaired by my Department and which held its first meeting in early January, is undertaking a comprehensive consultation process, starting tonight with a public meeting in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  This is one of a series of 15 public meetings that will be held throughout the country over the coming weeks.  Other elements of the extensive consultation process, in which I intend to be directly involved, include:- meetings with the relevant Government Department and Agencies &mdash; it is expected that these meetings will be completed by mid to late June;- meetings with key sectoral representatives and organisations, including the community &amp; voluntary sec<Col N="659"/>tors; and &mdash; a series of meetings with appropriate focus groups, including, for example, problem drug users, young people at risk and immigrant groups.In addition, my Department is continuing to accept written submissions on the new Strategy, in response to a call for submissions, which was advertised in the newspapers on 26th February last.  I am confident that the consultation process will significantly inform the work of the Steering Group as it develops proposals for the new Strategy in the second half of the year.</P>

	<P>Since its establishment in June 2002, my Department has carried out one advertising campaign aimed at raising awareness among Irish speaking communities of the importance of the Irish language and of ensuring its transmission to future generations. The campaign was conducted by consultants, who were appointed following a procurement process. Phase I of the campaign, entitled &ldquo;&Aacute;r dTeanga N&aacute;d&uacute;rtha F&eacute;in&rdquo;, took place in 2004/2005 at a total cost of &euro;238,367, while Phase II, entitled &ldquo;An Ghl&uacute;in Dheireanach&rdquo;, took place in 2006/2007 at a cost of &euro;421,279. The main <Col N="660"/>focus of the campaign was conveyed by way of advertisements carried in various broadcast media. A more detailed breakdown of the costs is not immediately to hand but if the Deputy requires further information in relation to the matter, I will be glad to have additional enquiries made.  For the sake of completeness, I should add that my Department has paid a total contribution of &euro;126,655 since 2006 towards an international tourism marketing campaign promoting the offshore islands of Ireland that was carried out by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</P>

	<P>Funding for coastal protection projects is available under my Department&rsquo;s Coastal Protection Programme.  The budget for the programme for 2008 is &euro;3.037 million.  In February 2008, my Department invited proposals from Local Authorities for inclusion in the 2008 Coastal Protection Programme. A single application was received from Fingal County Council in respect of the North County Dublin area. This application represented a request for funding at the dunes at Burrow Road, Sutton, Co. Dublin.  The 2008 Coast Protection Programme is currently being finalised and the above application will be given due consideration based on Exchequer funding and overall national priorities going forward.  A review of coastal protection requirements with a view to adopting a more long-term strategic and structured approach is currently in progress. </P>

	<P>My Department is currently responsible for the administration of the Foreshore Act 1933, including the issue of leases and licences for Offshore Windfarms.  The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 in respect all energy developments (including oil, gas, wave, wind and tidal energy) on the foreshore would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.  In the interim, all foreshore functions under the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2005 rest with my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department will carry forward responsibility for all other foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933, including in respect of all aquaculture developments and piers and harbours, other than in respect of port companies and harbour authorities governed by the Harbours Acts 1946, 1996 and 2000 and any other harbour or harbour related developments intended for commercial trade.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will clearly assume a critical role in relation to the future foreshore management of offshore wind development.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in that respect.</P>

In 2007 the person named applied to transfer the 9.14 entitlements by way of lease with land for a period of one year.  However the farmer to whom they were transferred by lease only used 1.36 of these entitlements under the 2007 Scheme year giving a 14.22 percent usage for 2007.  As the remaining 7.78 entitlements were unused for the three years 2005, 2006 and 2007, they will revert to the National Reserve. </P>
        <P>The person named will retain 1.36 standard entitlements.  As he does not have 80% usage in any one previous Scheme year, he is not permitted to transfer these entitlements without land.  He may however sell or gift the 1.36 entitlements with land or continue to lease the 1.36 entitlements with land.  There is no provision to allocate entitlements from the National Reserve in these circumstances.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In relation to the agriculture negotiations, the proposals currently under discussion are those tabled by the Chairperson of the WTO Agriculture Committee in his latest draft modalities paper in February 2008.  This 59 page paper identifies the outstanding issues in the agriculture negotiations and sets out all of the current proposals under discussion in the three Agriculture negotiating pillars of Domestic Supports, Export Competition and Market Access.  It includes a significant amount of text in square brackets to indicate where agreement is still outstanding.  The main elements of the proposals of direct relevance to Ireland are as follows:</P><Col N="664"/>
        <P>On domestic support, the proposal is to establish three bands for categorising overall trade-distorting domestic support levels and to reduce support levels in the top band by 75 to 85%, in the second band by 66 to 73% and in the third band by 50 to 60%.  An implementation period of five years is envisaged with a first instalment reduction of one-third on day one.  Additional commitments are sought in respect of product specific domestic support and payments categorised as &ldquo;blue box&rdquo;.  In addition, it is proposed to amend the definition of the Green Box in relation to decoupled and investment subsidies.</P>
        <P>The EU undertook major reform of the CAP in 2003, moving away from trade distorting domestic support towards decoupled payments.  In these circumstances, the range of reductions under discussion is unlikely to have any serious implications for EU domestic support programmes, although, if agreed, could reduce the margin for manoeuvre in the event of a crisis in the market.  The changes mooted to the definition of the Green Box are more serious and I would be concerned that they could have implications for the Single Farm Payment, particularly in respect of changes in payment models and new entrants.</P>
        <P>On market access, the proposal is to establish four bands for categorising import tariffs and to reduce tariff levels in the top band by 66 to 73%, in the second band by 62 to 65%, in the third band by 55 to 60% and in the fourth band by 48 to 52%.  An additional commitment is envisaged whereby a minimum average cut in tariffs is proposed.  The paper moots the possibility of the application of smaller tariff reductions to between 4 to 8% products that may be declared as sensitive by Members and contains a series of proposals for the treatment of such products.  It proposes that the deviations that may be made to the tariff cuts for such products may range from one-third, to one-half to two-thirds of the full tariff cut.  In such cases, to compensate for claiming sensitive product status, is suggested that an additional import quota must be established.  The paper also contains a series of options for addressing tariff simplification, tariff escalation, tariff quota administration and other related issues.</P>
        <P>The market access area is one where I have deep concerns.  Beef and most milk products are categorised in the top band and would therefore be subject to the deepest tariff cuts.  In this regard the proposals on sensitive products are critical.  It is essential that such status would deliver meaningful protection for the key Irish and EU production sectors.  As regards export competition, the paper proposes that direct export subsidies be eliminated by 2013 and contains a series of texts to introduce disciplines into other forms of export subsidies such as export credits, food aid and the monopoly powers of State Trading Enterprises.  My view is that there must be parallelism in the dismantling of all forms of export competition and that the phasing out process must provide all flexibilities required.</P>
        <P>This paper is the subject of intensive negotiations in Geneva at present.  The EU Commission represents the twenty-seven EU Member States in these negotiations.  Discussions are continuing with a view to the Chair being in a position to produce a revised paper by the end of April.  This revised paper could form the basis for an agriculture modalities paper which would be considered by WTO Ministers at a Ministerial meeting at some time in May 2008.  As I have stated and indeed informed the House on many occasions recently, I am very concerned about some of the proposals circulating in Geneva.  I am particularly concerned about the methodology for applying reduction commitments for export subsidies, the criteria for defining non-trade distorting domestic supports, the so called WTO Green Box payments and the market access proposals in relation to tariff reductions and the treatment of sensitive products.</P>
        <P>I have concerns also about non-trade issues insofar as they affect trade in agriculture products and the need to ensure that there is equivalence in standards of production within the EU and on product being imported.  On a general level, I am concerned that the issue of food security <Col N="665"/>&mdash; which is high on the world agenda &mdash; is taken into account.  I have and will continue to raise these concerns with the Commission to ensure that they secure an outcome that will not place a disproportionate burden on EU or Irish agriculture.  I will also continue to pursue an outcome which does not undermine the 2003 reforms of the CAP and ensures that Irish and EU agriculture can compete on world markets.</P>

In general, the person in question can assign to the purchaser of his lands so much of his or her milk quota as attaches to those lands by reference to the provisions of Regulation 4. If the lands are being sold other than to a family member as defined in Regulation 6, an application will have to be made under Regulation 7 to my Department for a certificate of entitlement to transfer the milk quota; and where the volume of milk quota in question exceeds, on average, 5,000 litres per acre, the applicant must provide a statutory declaration concerning his or her dairying enterprise. Other than that, there is no maximum or minimum amount laid down.</P>

	<P>The EU Commission has proposed a Thematic Strategy for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides which is currently under negotiation in the EU.  The Strategy includes a number of initiatives to reduce the impact of pesticides including a revised and extended Regulatory system for plant protection products.  A proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council is also being discussed which concerns the placing of plant protection products on the market. This proposal currently includes a provision for &lsquo;hazard-based cut-off criteria&rsquo; as a mechanism for making decisions relating to the approval of fungicides, herbicides and insecticides.  If unchanged, this provision could result in a significant reduction in the number of substances available for plant protection use in Europe.  My Department is continuing to press for a risk-based approach for the authorisation of these products which is the current system followed in the EU.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 305 and 306 together.</P>
        <P>My Department does not operate a debt relief scheme for schools and has no plans to introduce one in 2008. However a small number of schools have sought assistance as an exceptional matter to deal with serious financial difficulties.  Between 2002 and 2006, additional financial assistance for this purpose was provided to a total of 97 schools including schools in the Archdiocese of Dublin, mainly serving disadvantaged areas.   It should be noted that the <Col N="668"/>responsibility for sound financial management of schools&rsquo; affairs rests with school authorities and these were exceptional payments.</P>
        <P>Funding to schools to cover their day-to-day running costs has increased substantially in recent years. With increases in capitation and ancillary services funding, primary schools are now getting &euro;105 more per pupil per year than they were in 2002. The capitation grant has been increased to &euro;178.58 per child, and the ancillary services grant has risen to &euro;151.50 per child, bringing the total value of both grants to &euro;330 per pupil. This amounts to almost &euro;100,000 a year for a 300-pupil school.  There have also been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2008, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant was increased by &euro;15 per pupil and now amounts to &euro;331 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of &euro;15 per pupil in 2008 in the support services grant bringing that grant to &euro;204 per pupil.</P>
        <P>The cumulative increase of &euro;30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to &euro;535 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the <i>per capita</i> funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;300,000.  Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector along with those in the VEC sector are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the <i>per capita</i> grant. All schools are eligible for recurrent <i>per capita</i> grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.  Schools have, therefore, benefited from major increases in funding in recent years.  The Deputy will be aware that as well as general increases in capitation funding, extra financial supports are being provided to schools under the DEIS action plan for educational inclusion. In the current school year, DEIS related grants totalling almost &euro;19 million were paid to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The comparable amount paid for 2006/2007 was almost 17 million.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to prioritise the needs of schools serving disadvantaged communities going forward. The emphasis on tackling educational disadvantage in recent years is absolutely unprecedented. In 2008, we are investing over &euro;800 million in measures aimed at tackling disadvantage at all levels. This represents an increase of nearly &euro;70 million on the 2007 figure and an almost 74% increase on the &euro;460 million provided in 2003.  As well as continuing to prioritise disadvantaged schools, we are also determined to ensure that both primary and post-primary schools benefit from increased funding over the next five years. The Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to double the standard capitation grant for primary schools. Grants to schools for the employment of secretaries and caretakers will also be increased significantly.  In summary, therefore, we have substantially increased funding for schools and will prioritise further improvements in the years ahead.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 308, 310 and 339 together.</P>
        <P>The School Completion Programme, implemented in 2002, incorporates the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and assimilates the 8 to 15 Early School Leaver Initiative (ESLI) and Stay-in School Retention Initiative at Second Level (SSRI).   Evidence generated from the pilot phases of the School Completion Programme showed that the most effective way of addressing educational disadvantage is through an integrated services approach based on the development of local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. This prompted my Department to significantly expand the programme based on the project model in 2002 and again in 2006 under DEIS, the Action Plan for education inclusion.</P>
        <P>Details of funding allocated to the School Completion Programme over the past 5 years is as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2004 &mdash; &euro;23.473m</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2005 &mdash; &euro;24.060m</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2006 &mdash; &euro;24.662m</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2007 &mdash; &euro;28.888m</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2008 &mdash; &euro;31.160m</P>
<P FLI="0">The objective of the School Completion Programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education and aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process, entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.  It is based on the project model with an integrated approach involving primary and post primary schools, parents and relevant statutory, voluntary and community agencies. The programme is funded on a multi-annual basis under the National Development Plan (NDP) and up to 2007 with assistance from the European Social Fund (ESF)</P>
        <P>82 projects were selected to participate in the School Completion Programme in 2002. This number has increased, under DEIS, to 124 projects spanning 26 counties, comprising 224 post-primary schools and 468 primary schools and targeting approx. 36,000 young people.  A local <Col N="670"/>management committee, comprising of representatives of schools and other relevant agencies, manage each project.  Projects are required to engage in a consultative and planning process with the school staff, with parents and with local representatives of relevant statutory, voluntary and community agencies in the development of annual retention plans. What makes the School Completion Programme unique is its &lsquo;bottom up&rsquo; approach, which allows the local management committees to put together plans and supports that target the needs of local young people at risk of early school leaving. Each project employs a local Co-ordinator to run the project at local level.</P>
        <P>The level of funding allocated to projects is dependant on the submission of their annual Retention plan and taking into account the level of disadvantage in the schools involved in each project, the target group selected for intensive supports, the salaries of personnel employed and the overall level of funding available to the programme.  Current annual funding to projects range from approx. &euro;80,000 to over &euro;400,000 in respect of a full year&rsquo;s involvement in the Programme.   A National Co-ordination Team that comprises a National Co-ordinator and four Regional Co-ordinators support the School Completion Programme.  It is the task of the National Co-ordination Team to advise on and monitor the integrated area-based Retention Plans that support the young person at-risk at local level.  A Programme Research and Development Officer provides research and administrative support for the development, delivery and evaluation of the School Completion Programme.</P>
        <P>While data in relation to SCP target group is not readily available, the latest data published by my Department on retention rates in second-level schools relate to the cohort of entrants to the first year of junior cycle in 1997, 1998 and 1999. The published data for the 1999 cohort indicates that the national adjusted retention rate to completion of the Junior Certificate examination is 94.6% and the national adjusted retention rate to completion of the Leaving Certificate examination is 83.7%, an increase of 2.6% over 1996 cohort.</P>
        <P>This Government has pursued a dual strategy of both encouraging more young people to finish school and ensuring much greater second chance and further education opportunities for those who left school early. This kind of strategy ensures that young people are empowered to achieve their full potential, be that by sitting the Leaving Cert or by pursuing qualifications through other pathways such as Youthreach or FAS apprenticeships which may be more appropriate to their individual interests.  CSO data show that the educational profile of 20-24 year olds in Ireland has improved steadily over the last five years, as increasing opportunities have been made available in the further education and training sector. By 2006, 85.7% of 20-24 year olds had attained upper second-level education or equivalent, up from 84% in 2002 and putting Ireland ahead of the EU average of 77.8%.</P>

	<P>In the region of &euro;730 million will be spent by my Department this year on tackling educational disadvantage at all levels &mdash; from pre-school to further and higher education.  This represents an increase of over 60% and is testament to the Government&rsquo;s determination to prioritise social inclusion and ensure that all our children and young people get the supports they need to do well at school.  Social inclusion measures across all Government departments have also been prioritised under the <Col N="673"/>Towards 2016 agreement, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-16 and the National Development Plan. </P>
        <P>In the current school year, grants totalling almost &euro;19 million were paid to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds under DEIS (the Action plan for Educational Inclusion).  These financial supports allocated to each of the schools selected under DEIS provides for the inclusion of after school and holiday time support &mdash; for literacy and numeracy development as well as homework support, social and personal development and arts activities.  Preventative measures are also in place such as the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL), with &euro;31.160m allocated to the School Completion Programme for 2008. Under the School Completion Programme children at risk of early school leaving are targeted for a variety of extra supports, educational and non-educational, during and outside of school time &mdash; all aimed at encouraging them to stay in school.  The Home School Community Liaison Scheme helps to get parents involved in their children&rsquo;s education, which as we all know is a crucial component of convincing young people of the value of education.</P>
        <P>After-school activities are delivered as part of the School Completion Programme and homework clubs in particular are a widely implemented support to provide students with a structured environment to complete homework.  After-School Supports provided under the School Completion Programme focus on the personal and social development of young people, aiming to enrich their overall educational experience by providing fun activities that tap into the many talents of young people. Programmes that focus on activities like Drama, Music, Art, Craftwork and Sport enable children to develop a range of creative and sporting skills.   These activities help to boost self-esteem, have positive consequences for the classroom and are particularly important for academically weaker students.  The provision of Out-of-School supports is also one of the four central supports of the School Completion Programme.</P>
        <P>In addition &euro;1.7m has been allocated under Dormant Accounts for a new scheme to enable DEIS Band 1 Schools in Limerick City to open after school hours (2008 Programme).  This scheme has been developed as part of the Department&rsquo;s response to the education related recommendations contained in John Fitzgerald report, &lsquo;Addressing issues of Social Exclusion in Moyross and other disadvantaged areas of Limerick City: Report to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion.  The recommendations of the Fitzgerald report were accepted in full by Cabinet.</P>
        <P>The scheme aims to support up to 22 DEIS Band 1 schools in Limerick City to enable them to make the school premises and its facilities available to children and the wider community after school hours at the weekend and during school holidays.  The school premises would be available for a wide range of activities, including homework clubs, drama, art &amp; craft, adult literacy, and sports etc.  The Government is conscious that tackling social exclusion requires a whole of Government response and that many Departments have roles to play in addressing disadvantage. The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, supported by the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion and the Office for Social Inclusion provides the necessary coordination to ensure the development, coordination and drive for Social Inclusion Policy developments and Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under Towards 2016 and the National Action Plan on Social Inclusion 2007 -2016.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.  Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school indicate that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 49 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year is a Principal and 2 mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 47 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which will issue to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will be a Principal and 1 mainstream class teacher.  Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing <Col N="675"/>school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The first meeting of the Appeal Board is scheduled to take place on the 20 May, 2008. Further meetings will be held in June and October, 2008. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 9 May, 20 June and 10 October respectively. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.</P>

	<P>The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in rapidly developing areas as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  On the 1st February last I announced the first phase of projects that will commence construction during 2008 and 2009. My announcement included details of the 18 large scale building projects approved for construction and a further 30 primary school projects in rapidly developing areas.  Details of the projects approved can be viewed under the Press Release section of my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.  This is the first phase of projects that will commence construction during 2008 and 2009. It is my intention to make a further announcement shortly to allow a further batch of schools to progress and to update progress on the new schools planned for September 2008 delivery in developing areas.</P>

	<P>Teacher allocations to post-primary schools are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment. Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils&rsquo; needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation. </P>
        <P>I believe that the arts have an important role to play in the education of the individual. Music, the visual arts and drama provide for sensory, emotional, intellectual and creative enrichment and contribute to the young person&rsquo;s holistic development and self esteem. Arts education (visual arts, music and drama) is one of the seven curriculum areas that comprise <Col N="676"/>the primary curriculum, which was revised in 1999. At second level there are approved syllabuses for Junior Certificate in Music and Art, Craft and Design. In the senior cycle there are syllabuses in Music and Art. Modules in the Arts are also available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied and in the Transition Year programme. In the delivery of these programmes, schools are encouraged to interact with practising artists in their own classrooms and in out of school settings.</P>
        <P>In addition to supporting Music in the curriculum, an additional allocation of the equivalent of 93 whole time teaching posts are allocated to a range of VECs to support Music education. This takes the form of individual tuition in instrumental and vocal music education, and provision of supports for choirs, orchestras and ensembles. Through this some 68,000 hours of music tuition are provided annually.</P>

        <Quest> the progress made towards removing the obstacles with regard to insurance which currently prevents the majority of school halls being utilised for sports and community uses when not required by the school; her views on whether this could bring much needed revenues to schools in addition to providing community facilities; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary responsibility of my Department in this area is the provision of school facilities for the effective delivery of the curriculum.  In addition, school authorities have a considerable degree of autonomy in relation to how their premises are managed and utilised at local level.  However, I do recognise that there is a lack of recreational facilities for community use in certain areas which could be met if school premises were made available to the wider community. To encourage schools in this respect, my Department issued a circular to all school authorities in late 2005 urging trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available where possible for community education and recreation purposes. Decisions in relation to the use of school facilities remain entirely at the discretion of the school authorities, subject to the condition that the needs of the students attending the school are prioritised in the first instance.</P>
        <P>My Department has also progressed a number of school building projects within the Fingal and Adamstown areas of Dublin with local Authority/Developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing. I believe this model can be used to advantage across the country in future particularly in the area of shared community facilities.  My Department&rsquo;s position generally is that the availability of such facilities should be self-funding i.e. adequate to cover the heat/light/caretaking arrangements as well as making some contribution to the repair of wear and tear on premises caused by increased use. Of utmost importance, schools should ensure that insurance and security are covered as it is unlikely that a school&rsquo;s insurance policy would cover non-school activities or that a caretaker would be routinely available to open/lock up premises.</P>

	<P>Substantial progress has been made in the provision of textbooks and resources specifically for use in Gaeltacht and other all-Irish schools, particularly since Sc&eacute;im na nDearth&oacute;ir&iacute; was established in 2001, and An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta was set up in 2002.  An Chomhairle was established to co-ordinate the provision of textbooks and aids to support Irish, to advise on policies relating to Irish in schools generally and in all-Irish and Gaeltacht schools, to provide support services through the medium of Irish and to undertake research in this area.</P>
        <P>An Chomhairle works closely with An G&uacute;m, Sc&eacute;im na nDearth&oacute;ir&iacute; and other agencies to address the deficit in Irish medium resources and materials.  It has published an extensive resource directory on its website (www.cogg.ie) on materials and resources now available to support the teaching of Irish in the curriculum, and the teaching of other subjects through Irish, across primary and post primary schools.  A complete list of Teaching Aids and Resources has also been sent to Gaeltacht schools and Gaelscoileanna.  A full range of teaching resources (1 per subject) is now available for primary Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools.  Some &euro;1m per annum is being invested under the Sc&eacute;im in a new set of materials for primary schools, known as S&eacute;ide&aacute;n S&iacute;.  The packs include a teacher&rsquo;s handbook, books, posters, picture cards, compact discs, puppets and card games and are currently available for all classes up to third class.  This investment will continue until a complete set of resources for the 8 year cycle is available.</P>
        <P>At post primary level there are resources available for Maths, History, Geography, Science, CSPE, Technical Graphics and French at junior cycle.  At senior cycle textbooks are available for Maths, History and Home Economics.  In 2007, my Department allocated an additional &euro;300,000 to An Chomhairle for materials and resources development to support teaching and learning through the medium of Irish, bringing their budget in 2007 to &euro;1.245 million. This level of funding has been maintained in 2008.</P>

	<P>The July Education Programme is available to all special schools and mainstream primary schools with special classes catering for children with autism who choose to extend their education services through the month of July. My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability. Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.  The Deputy will appreciate, that as the July home based provision takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned. My Department&rsquo;s qualification preference is for a fully qualified teacher.  Where parents cannot recruit a fully qualified teacher, then some alternative qualifications are acceptable including certain Montessori qualifications. Details in this regard are published on my Department&rsquo;s web site.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.  Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 49 pupils. In accordance with the staffing <Col N="681"/>schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year is a Principal and 2 mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 47 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which will issue to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will be a Principal and 1 mainstream class teacher.  Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The first meeting of the Appeal Board is scheduled to take place on 20 May 2008. Further meetings will be held in June and October 2008. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 9 May, 20 June and 10 October respectively. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.</P>

        <Quest> the reason an institution (details supplied) in Dublin 6 was not included in the schedule of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 despite the institution being subject to a regulatory or inspection function, a fact recognised by the Department of Health and Children; and if she will include the institution in a revised Schedule. </Quest>
        <QRef>[15271/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board was established under Statute in 2002 and is governed by the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002.  The Board was established to make fair and reasonable payments to persons who, as children, were abused while residents in Industrial Schools, Reformatories and other institutions subject to State regulation or inspection and who were placed in such institutions by the State. The Board is independent in the performance of its functions.  When the Act was initially established, the Schedule to the Act contained a total of 128 institutions.   In compiling the list, the Department of Education &amp; Science had cause to make enquiries from the Department of Health &amp; Children, under whose jurisdiction some of the institutions operated, as to whether certain institutions could be considered for inclusion having regard to the criteria for eligibility.  </P>
        <P>Since the enactment of the legislation, my Department received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of other institutions which may warrant consideration for inclusion.  Following consideration of the matter, I signed an Order on 9th November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule.   A further Order was made on 1st July 2005 adding 3 institutions to the Schedule.  The question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered by my Department and it is not proposed to add any further institutions to the Schedule.   The intention was that all institutions which were brought to the attention of my Department would be considered and a decision made as to their eligibility for inclusion prior to the closing date for receipt of applications to the Board which was the 15th December 2005.</P>
        <P>In making its initial enquiries in relation to the institution in question, my Department consulted with the Department of Health &amp; Children to establish if it could be considered for inclusion on the Schedule to the Act.  The response to my Department was that, following a review of papers available in the Department of Health &amp; Children, they were unable to locate any documentation which would indicate that a public body had an inspection or regulatory function in relation to the institution.  At that time, the Department of Health &amp; Children was not in a position to recommend its inclusion in the Schedule.  Given that we were not in a position to confirm whether there was a state inspection or regulatory role, the institution could not be considered to be eligible for inclusion.  No further enquiries were made at that time as to whether this institution would have been eligible under any other criteria.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health advised this Department in May 2007 that certain papers had come to light which indicated a state regulatory and inspection role and that this Department may now wish to consider its inclusion on the Schedule to the Redress Act.  However, further enquiries made by this Department with the Department of Health &amp; Children, revealed that one of the papers in relation to the institution which prompted them to recognise a regulatory or inspection function was the report of an inspection conducted under the Registration of Maternity Homes Act, 1934.  The expression &ldquo;maternity home&ldquo; means any premises which are, either wholly or partly, used or intended to be used for the reception of pregnant women or women immediately after childbirth&rdquo;.  There are several references on the papers held by the <Col N="683"/>Department of Health &amp; Children describing this institution as a Mother and Baby Home.  It would seem that persons in this facility attended on a voluntary basis as opposed to having been placed there by the State.</P>
        <P>Section 4 (1) of the Act states that the Minister for Education &amp; Science, may, by Order, provide for the insertion of any industrial school, reformatory, orphanage, children&rsquo;s home, special school which was established for the purpose of providing education services to children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or illness.  It is clear from the information available to this Department that the institution to which the Deputy refers operated as a Mother and Baby Home and is therefore not eligible to be considered for inclusion on the Schedule to the Redress Act on the basis that it does not satisfy the criteria as set out in the aforementioned Section.  I should of course point out that ineligibility to be considered for redress under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002, does not affect a person&rsquo;s statutory right to pursue other legal avenues which may be open to them.</P>

	<P>While comprehensive information is held on individual school files, my Department does not yet have these details available in a format that provides readily accessible cumulative information on the overall position regarding temporary accommodation.  However, this issue is being addressed as a matter of urgency and work on compiling a comprehensive database of such information is well advanced.  This work is part of a general review of rental policy being undertaken. Information is being collated on approximately 900 schools which have received approval from the Department for temporary accommodation, including but not limited to prefabs. This will be used to produce a database of information which will be maintained on an ongoing basis and will inform my Department&rsquo;s future decision-making in this area. I anticipate this work will be completed shortly.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002.  In considering the need to provide extra resource and other teachers to schools in recent years, the Government could have decided to make children wait until permanent accommodation could be provided.  However, we prioritised putting the extra teachers into schools as soon as possible.  Against this background, my Department has nonetheless managed to keep expenditure on temporary accommodation low. When the rental and purchase of temporary accommodation is taken together, it still only comes to 6.2% of overall investment in school buildings last year.</P>

	<P Just="Left">While figures on the number of teen parents in second level are not readily available, the most recent CSO figures indicate 2362 teen births in 2006. Of these, 1254 were to mothers aged 18 years or younger.  For young <Col N="684"/>parents of school-going age, the most pressing issues are considered to be a sensitive response to their needs, appropriate counselling/mentoring and medical assistance, minimal disruption of tuition, and appropriate access to childcare.  Individual circumstances will differ and accordingly, school management practice will vary from case to case. Generally, when it comes to the attention of the school that a pupil is pregnant, the school authorities check to ensure that the girl is receiving appropriate medical assistance and counselling advice. Schools endeavour to be sensitive and understanding to the girl&rsquo;s needs while trying to ensure that her education is not neglected.</P>
        <P>Home tuition is provided to pregnant schoolgirls who are absent from school during the later stages of pregnancy or immediately following the birth of a baby when attendance may be impractical. In 2006/07, home tuition was approved for 69 pregnant girls attending post primary schools, while in 2007/08 school year to date, home tuition has been approved for 59 pregnant girls attending post primary schools.</P>
        <P>Funding has been committed in 2008 for the education element of 8 Teenage Parenting Support projects as a specific gender element of the School Completion Programme under DEIS in preventing early school leaving among teenage mothers. Approximately, 1000 young parents are targeted by the Teen Parenting Support Programme (TPSP). In 2006, there were 412 new referrals to TPSP, of which 23% (95) were in second level at the time of referral. The programme also supported 13 young fathers in 2006. Links have been established between local School Completion projects in these areas, assisted by the SCP National Coordination Team and the Teenage Parenting Support Initiative Coordinators. The aim of these projects is to enable young women who are pregnant and young mothers to stay in second level education and to progress on to third level education or training. The Project does this by providing individual support, information and grinds where necessary. Young people participating in Teen Parenting Support Programmes are targeted in-school, out-of-school and in higher/further education, giving them the opportunity to reach their full potential through continued participation in education and training. This will improve their life opportunities and reduce the likelihood of the young family experiencing poverty and social exclusion and being long-term dependants on state support.</P>
        <P>Greater affordability of childcare, linked to the creation of additional childcare places, has been a key principle in both the previous and current National Development Plans. This Government has provided unprecedented levels of funding for childcare in recent years. &euro;499.3 million was allocated to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) 2000-2006 and some 41,000 places will have been created by the time the programme finishes. Going forward, childcare provision will continue to attract substantial investment under the new National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010. &euro;575m has been allocated to the new programme, which will be administered by the Office of the Minister for Children and aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality childcare services by supporting the creation of an additional 50,000 places. This Government also introduced the Early Childhood Supplement of &euro;1000 per child under six to help parents with childcare costs.</P>
        <P>The Government discussion paper, &ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents,&rdquo; put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.</P>
        <P>A working group, comprised of officials from across a range of Government Departments, on which my Department is represented, is currently working on an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations. Work on the development of this implementation plan is progressing. Issues including access to childcare support, education, training and acti<Col N="685"/>vation measures continue to be discussed with the relevant Departments and Agencies.  In this regard, my Department is at present co-operating with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Office of the Minister for Children and F&Aacute;S in testing the non-income activation proposals in Coolock in Dublin and in Kilkenny.</P>

	<P>The cumulative value of advertising placed by my Department in each of the five years to date was as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2008 &mdash; &euro;157,000 (to end March)</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2007 &mdash; &euro;816,000</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2004 &mdash; &euro;790,000</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department advertises for a wide range of educational related schemes and programmes. The advertising encompasses, for example, expenditure on the following significant categories: Invitations to tender for school building projects, staff appointments in the education sector, invitations to attend local hearings, invitations to forward submissions on education related schemes/projects.  A detailed breakdown of the type of advertising placed is not readily available.  If the Deputy has a particular advertising campaign in mind I would be happy to have my officials obtain the relevant details and communicate them to the Deputy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The States advertising is subject to a tender process through the Government's Supplies Agency. My Department understands that the current State advertising contract stipulates that the costs of the advertisements are inclusive of all production costs associated with the insertion of the advertisements into the print media.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 343 and 344 together.</P>
        <P>My Department spent &euro;4.3m on the purchase and &euro;35.5m on the rental of temporary accommodation in 2007.  The Deputy will be aware that demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002. In considering the need to provide extra resource and other teachers to schools in recent years, the Government could have decided to make children wait until permanent accommodation could be provided. However, we prioritised putting the extra teachers into schools as soon as possible. Against this background, my Department has nonetheless managed to keep expenditure on temporary accommodation low.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the amount spent on rental and purchased accommodation in 2007 was only 6.2% of the total investment in school buildings in 2007. This compares with 10.8% in 2003. It should also be noted that temporary accommodation is not limited to prefabs and can also involve the rental of high quality buildings.</P>

	<P>A tender report for the school building project referred to by the Deputy has been received in my Department.   As part of the Programme for Government, a Developing Areas Unit was set up recently in my Department to focus on the school accommodation needs of rapidly developing areas, including Naas.  The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  In this context, the status of all schools in Naas is being assessed as part of an overall delivery plan, which is currently being formulated within the Developing Areas Unit.  As is the case with all large capital projects currently on hand within the Unit, their progression will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. </P>

	<P>In dealing with allegations of verbal and physical abuse of students by teachers the most important consideration to be taken into account is the protection of children. Their safety and well-being must be the priority. Allegations of abuse may raise child protection issues or if they are of a less serious nature may fall to be dealt with at a local level by the school authorities.  Any allegation which raises child protection concerns must be dealt with in accordance with the national child protection guideline &ldquo;Children First&rdquo;. My Department has produced guidelines for both Primary and Post-Primary schools for dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse by school employees and other persons. The guidelines provide detailed information for schools in relation to the handling of allegations, both from the perspective of the student and the employee.</P>
        <P>Where an allegation, of a less serious nature, is dealt with at local level by the school authorities and a parent is dissatisfied with the way it has been dealt with, they may make a written complaint to my Department which will review the procedures and practices adopted by the school when dealing with the allegation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no plans to alter the legal status of members of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF).   There is a very comprehensive range of national and EU legislation dealing with employment rights and protection of employees.  However, members of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) are not &lsquo;employees&rsquo; or &lsquo;workers&rsquo; in the generally accepted meaning of those terms.  The Defence Acts, 1954 to 2006 prescribe that the Defence Forces shall consist of a Permanent Defence Force and a Reserve Defence Force.  Members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) are engaged in the service of the State on a full-time basis and are in receipt of pay and allowances accordingly.  The RDF is a part-time, volunteer organisation.  Members are free to determine their own level of participation in Reserve activities and may resign from the Reserve at any time.  Their service is provided entirely on a voluntary basis with no compulsion to attend.</P>
        <P>Members of the Reserve undergo both paid and unpaid training.  In addition there is provision for a gratuity to be paid to those members who meet certain attendance criteria.  Prior to 1 January 2008 members of the Reserve were themselves responsible for dealing with any tax issues.  Since that date they have been taxed at source (under PAYE) following an approach from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Payments to members for periods of full-time training, etc. not exceeding 21 consecutive days are not liable to Social Insurance Contributions as such. However, where weekly payments exceed a specified threshold (currently &euro;500 a week), the Health Contribution of 2% is payable and is deducted as PRSI Class K. Where weekly payment does not exceed the threshold, there is no Health Contribution liability and this is recorded as PRSI Class M.  PRSI Class H (the rate applicable to NCOs and enlisted personnel of the Permanent Defence Force) is applied to members who attend for periods of full-time training, etc. in excess of 21 consecutive days.</P>

	<P>There are no plans to deploy members of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) to Chad or to any other current overseas mission.  However, policies to support the preparation and selection of suitably qualified personnel for overseas duties are being developed.   It is hoped that a small number of Reservists may be available to serve overseas by the end of next year (2009).   This is likely to be in specialised areas such as medical, transport, engineering and communications and information services.  This will also be subject to personnel having suitable qualifications, their personal availability and appropriate training.</P>

	<P>The only advertising campaign of the kind referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question carried out by my Department during the past five years is the public information and awareness campaign on emergency planning which was launched by the Taoiseach on Monday, 14 April last.  The campaign involves the distribution of an information handbook to every household in the country, together with an advertising campaign to let people know that the handbook is on the way and to encourage everyone to read it.  Advertisements were placed in the print media, on radio and on outdoor billboards.  While the full costs associated with the preparation and implementation of the campaign are not yet available, they are estimated to be approximately &euro;2m.  This figure includes the cost of design, printing and distribution of 1.8 million handbooks and the associated media advertising costs and other support costs.  It also includes the cost of designing the website www.emergencyplanning.ie.</P>

	<P>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service receives a considerable and diverse range of applications for permission to remain in the State including applications for long term residency.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the processing time for dealing with such applications can vary depending on the type of application involved and the particular circumstances of the individual concerned.  In all instances, processing arrangements are kept under ongoing review and steps are taken to ensure that applications are dealt with as quickly as possible having regard to overall resources across the full range of services provided by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.</P>
        <P>I understand that applications received in August 2006 are currently being dealt with.  The procedures for processing long term residency applications have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the long term residency  process.  I have recently deployed additional staff to the Immigration Division of my Department for the purpose of processing long term residency applications and I am satisfied that these additional resources will make an impact in processing the backlog on hand and dealing with the ongoing increase in the number of applications being received.</P>

A total of &euro;828,000 was spent on staff training for the Department in 2007 and hundreds of individuals benefited from this activity.  Leadership training is a component in virtually all courses delivered for my officials so it is not practicable to isolate the data sought by the Deputy in terms of individual beneficiaries.</P>

	<P>Any comparison with transfers generally in the Public Service must take into account the fact that the duties of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are unique and wide ranging.  This is evident in the requirement for Garda recruits to undergo a two year intensive training programme.  These unique duties and training requirements militate against the introduction of a similar incremental credit scheme as is in place for other areas of the Public Service.</P>

	<P>The person concerned, accompanied by his two children, arrived in the State on 4 April 2006 and applied for asylum.  His asylum application was refused following the consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 31 March 2008, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect him and his two children.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of deportation orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he and his two children should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  While no response has been received to date, the Deputy might note that the 15 working day period has not yet elapsed.

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Questions No. 128 of Thursday, 8 February 2007 and No. 213 of Thursday, 29 June 2006 and the written Replies to those Questions.  The person concerned arrived in the State on 28 November 2001 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 23 April 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, by letter dated 17 May 2007, the person concerned, through his legal representative, submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). <Col N="697"/>However, this application was not accepted as it was not signed by the person concerned. As a result, the application was returned to the legal representative of the person concerned, by letter dated 30 May 2007. This communication informed the legal representative that, before this application could be considered, it must be returned, fully completed, within a period of ten working days from the date of that letter. The completed application for Subsidiary Protection in the State was not returned to my Department by the due date and, as such, no further consideration has been, or will be, given to that application.</P>
        <P>The case file of the person concerned now falls to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). The Deputy can be assured that all representations submitted by or on behalf of the person concerned will be fully considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 376 and 377 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, I recently approved the 2008 Garda Annual Policing Plan and laid it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It sets out the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals to realign the boundaries of Garda Divisions around the country to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  Included in this is a plan to establish a new Garda Division in Kildare. The planned changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.  A detailed programme of work is currently being developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement these planned changes for various Garda Divisions.  This programme of work will also examine the geographical areas of district and sub-district stations arising from the regional and divisional boundary realignments set out in the plan and will set out a timetable for the establishment of the new divisions.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that resource allocation is currently under review and no final decision has been made on the matter.  I am further informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of 31 March 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the personnel strength of the Carlow/Kildare Garda Division was 408.  The personnel strength of Athy Garda Station on the same date was 19.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual divisions and stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.</P>
        <P>Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. The allocation of Garda personnel is determined by a number of factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Division.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account.  In that regard, the needs of Garda Stations throughout County Kildare will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Stations and Divisions throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to let the Deputy know that earlier this year the Government accepted my proposal that it should take over the Spent Convictions Bill 2007, introduced into the D&aacute;il in October 2007 as a Private Members&rsquo; Bill by Deputy Barry Andrews, and adopt it as a Government Bill. It is my intention to bring the necessary motion to the House at the appropriate time to give effect to the Government&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>The Bill reflects the recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report on spent convictions which was published in July 2007. The report recognises that securing employment can be a very effective way of achieving the rehabilitation of convicted persons and it seeks to facilitate that objective by the introduction of a procedure whereby certain convictions may be regarded as &lsquo;spent&rsquo;. As a result, the report recommends the establishment of a procedure that will allow for the non-disclosure of certain convictions where certain conditions are met, i.e. the convictions may, in those circumstances, be regarded as &lsquo;spent&rsquo;. The procedure proposed by the Commission and reflected in the Bill does not, however, entail a deletion of the conviction from the Garda records.</P>
        <P>The report recommends that:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The following categories of offences should be excluded completely from any proposed legislation on spent convictions: (i) any offence triable by the Central Criminal Court; (ii) any offence under the Sexual Offenders Act 2001; (iii) any offence where a sentence of at least 6 months (including suspended sentences) has been imposed by a court.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A conviction may be regard as &lsquo;spent&rsquo; 7 years from the date of conviction where a custodial sentence of less than 6 months was imposed and where the person has not re-offended in the meantime, or after 5 years in the case of a non-custodial sentence.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />All convictions, including spent convictions, must be disclosed at a sentencing hearing for any subsequent offence and in some non-criminal procedures (e.g. adoption proceedings, vetting procedures involving access to children).</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The procedure should operate on an automatic basis. This means that convictions become &lsquo;spent&rsquo; automatically after the requirements of the scheme have been met, i.e. a person will not have to make an application to qualify for &lsquo;conviction free status&rsquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The report also makes specific recommendations regarding the issue of vetting and disclosure of criminal history for certain purposes.  The Commission recommends that the current Garda vetting system be put on a statutory footing.  The report also recommends that certain sensitive posts would require full disclosure of all convictions, including spent convictions.  It lists the following posts:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Any post involving care of children or vulnerable adults,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Any health care post,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Judges, barristers, solicitors, court clerks, court registrars and employees of the Courts Service,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Members of the Defence Forces, Prison Officers, members of the Probation Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Accountants,</P><Col N="701"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Director, controller or manager of a financial institution or of any financial service provider which is regulated by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Pending the enactment of the Bill, there is no general provision in Irish law allowing for the deletion or otherwise of criminal convictions from the Garda criminal records.  However, section 258 of the Children Act 2001 (which came into effect on 1 May 2002) provides a limited but significant procedure in respect of most offences committed by persons under 18, once certain conditions have been met.  As a result, the effects of a conviction are limited where the relevant conditions have been met. The person in question is regarded for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed, been charged with, prosecuted for, found guilty or dealt with for an offence. Any individual who comes within the terms of section 258 is not required to disclose the criminal conviction under any circumstances even if asked to do so. The section is fully retrospective so that it applies whether the offence occurred before or after the coming into force of the section. It is envisaged that the Spent Convictions Bill would operate in broadly similar terms to section 258 in the case of adult offenders.</P>

        <Quest> his views on statistics made available in April 2008 by the chief superintendent in the Dublin metropolitan region west division which demonstrate a marked increase in the number of public order incidents, which are up 22% overall, up 50% in Lucan, 20% in Clondalkin, 22% in Ballyfermot and 23% in Ronanstown; and the new initiatives he will undertake in order to reverse this trend. </Quest>
        <QRef>[15278/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the nature of public order offences that in the majority of cases they are recorded and detected only because of the vigilance of Garda&iacute;.  The increase in the number of public disorder and anti-social behaviour type offences recorded is predominantly due to more pro-active policing and the Commissioner&rsquo;s enforcement policy in respect of such offences.  In the DMR West Division it is also due to interaction with local community groups which have requested additional public order policing.  </P>
        <P>In particular, it is due to pro-active policing of public parks and specifically targeting designated public disorder &lsquo;hot-spots&rsquo; in a concerted effort to tackle the concerns expressed by residents.  Extra foot, bicycle and mobile patrols have been directed by local Garda management in these areas, and additional &lsquo;hot-spots&rsquo; have been identified.  Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 it is open to me to set policing priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. One of the priorities I have set for 2008 is to combat, particularly in cooperation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder.  I specified that there should be particular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour (including under age drinking) and socially disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P>I also set up an Advisory Group which has reported to me on this issue and made recommendations.  I am bringing forward legislation with the aim of controlling access to alcohol and consumption of alcohol, particularly from the off licence trade, by young people and others, as well as other measures to deal with disorderly behaviour due to drinking.  Details will be announced in the very near future.  With the help of all parties in the House, we should have this legislation enacted before the summer.</P>
        <P>Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order. In addition, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) <Col N="702"/>Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.  Operation Encounter was commenced by the Garda Commissioner in February 2002 to target public order and anti-social behaviour against the community and local businesses. The Operation specifically targets offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1996 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, which include the sale and consumption of alcohol by underage persons. Almost 465,000 offences have been detected since the commencement of Operation Encounter.</P>
        <P>Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour. Under the agreed Programme for Government 2007-2013, I have pledged to increase the number of projects in operation nationwide from the current total of 100 to 168.  There are currently five Garda Youth Diversion Projects in operation in the areas referred to by the Deputy, one in Clondalkin, two in Ballyfermot and two in Ronanstown.  An application to establish a Garda Youth Diversion Project in other areas would be considered in the context of the proposed expansion of the scheme.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the total personnel strength of Lucan, Clondalkin, Ballyfermot and Ronanstown Garda stations  at 31 March, 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is 362.   This represents an increase of  4% since 31 March, 2007.  An unprecedented increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continuing in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, with an intake of approximately 1,100 recruits per annum. In addition, there is a significant expansion under way in the number of civilian staff being made available to the Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area.  The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and senior Garda officers, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area.  There are currently 29 committees in operation in a pilot phase, the purpose of which is to gain experience before rolling the committees out to all local authority areas in the State.  As part of the pilot phase, a committees has been established in the local authority area of South Dublin.  In general the outcome to date has been positive, and the committees are meeting definite local needs.  Following consultation with my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs,  I intend to issue revised guidelines to enable the roll out of the committees to take place shortly.  The statistics quoted by the Deputy were provided to the South Dublin County Council Joint Policing Committee by the Garda representative at a recent meeting.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s question has also been submitted to my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, whose Department does of course have lead responsibility for these matters.  Nevertheless, and arising from my Department&rsquo;s specific involvement in the field of Youth Diversion and Young Person&rsquo;s Probation Services, there are a number of projects funded by us which come within the scope of the Deputy&rsquo;s query as follows.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Garda Youth Diversion Projects</i></P>
        <P>Garda Youth Diversion Projects are multi-agency, community based, crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young offenders and those at risk of offending from criminal and/or anti-social behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long term employability prospects.  Garda Youth Diversion Projects are funded by the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) and operated in conjunction with the Garda Community Relations Section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Projects are established after a positive assessment of an application by the Garda Commissioner. An application is assessed in terms of local demographics, crime statistics, and other socioeconomic factors and will also take into account the level of services already provided for young people in the area. The projects are managed locally by independent management companies.</P>
        <P>Garda Youth Diversion Projects offer opportunities for education, employment training, sport, art, music and other activities. Many operate outside of school hours. In areas with a high proportion of early school-leavers, activities may also be planned during the daytime.  There are currently 100 projects operating throughout the country. The Government has <Col N="706"/>pledged to ensure there are a total of 168 projects in operation by the end of the current Programme for Government.  Overall funding for the Projects is set at &euro;11.909 million for 2008.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Young Person&rsquo;s Probation (YPP) &mdash; out of School</i></P>
        <P>The Irish Youth Justice Service, through the Young Person&rsquo;s Probation Division of the Probation Service, funds four projects that provide either &lsquo;out of school&rsquo; services to young people in need, &lsquo;after school&rsquo; services or both services. The funding to these projects is for general programme provision.  The projects do not accept children who should be in the school system unless they are referred by the National Educational Welfare Board.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Cox&rsquo;s Demesne, Dundalk, provide support to children on a sessional basis who are released from school for specific periods during the day. The project also provides an after school service for a younger cohort of children. </P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Candle Community Trust provide after school services. </P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Adventure Sports Project provide after school services.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />C&eacute;im ar C&eacute;im provide after school services and educational services to out of school children referred by the Educational Welfare Board. </P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">It is not possible to separately identify the funding for out of schools services provided by these projects but total funding to these projects in 2008 amounts to &euro;838,200.  In addition, Waterford Youth Training Education Centre (W.Y.T.E.C.) provides out of school service to a small number of students (2 out of 70).  Total funding from my Department through the Probation Service to the W.Y.T.E.C. for the range of programmes it delivers to clients of the Probation Service in the current year is &euro;150,000.</P>

	<P>As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, my role in relation to the planning system is mainly to provide, and keep up to date, the legislative and policy guidance framework. The day-to-day operation of the planning system is a matter for the planning authorities.  The legislative framework comprises the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006 which represents a comprehensive consolidation and updating of the planning code.  As regards <Col N="707"/>policy guidance, my Department has issued a large number of planning guidelines under section 28 of the Planning Act which planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are obliged to have regard to in the exercise of their planning functions.  These include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Development Plan Guidelines (June 2007);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Development Management Guidelines (June 2007);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments (September 2007). </P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">Draft Guidelines for planning authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas issued in February 2008. I also issued updated guidance in February on Taking in Charge of Residential Developments/Management Arrangements (Circular Letter PD 1/08).  My Department is currently drafting planning guidelines relating to flood risk management in planning in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, and on planning, land use and national roads with the Department of Transport and the National Roads Authority.  I expect to publish these draft guidelines for public consultation later this summer. </P>
        <P>In addition to the above, work is underway in my Department with the aim of:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />securing better integration between housing development and the provision of infrastructure and services such as schools, public transport, open spaces, play areas and other community facilities under the Developing Areas Initiative;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reviewing the decision-making process by local authorities in the zoning of land to ensure maximum transparency in this process; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />ensuring greater integration between the National Spatial Strategy, Regional Planning Guidelines, development plans and local area planning.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department has expressed views to local authorities on elements of their Development Plans and I have intervened in the Development Plan process where necessary in the interests of ensuring good planning and sustainable development and compliance with the National Spatial Strategy.  The performance of the planning system is kept under ongoing review by way of statistics collected by my Department and a range of performance indicators which form part of the annual report on Service Indicators in Local Authorities.  Copies of these are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.environ.ie.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 395 and 396 together.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of planning control is a matter for individual planning authorities, who have substantial enforcement powers under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006.  Under planning legislation, the planning authority can take action if a development does not have the required permission, or where the terms of permission have not been met.  The Plan<Col N="708"/>ning and Development Act 2000 gave substantial additional powers to planning authorities in the area of enforcement.  For example, the Act provided for the first time that the making of an application for retention permission could no longer be used as a defence against a prosecution for unauthorised development.  Under the Act a planning authority may issue an enforcement notice in respect of an unauthorised development, requiring such steps as the authority considers necessary to be taken within a specified period.  In the event of non-compliance, the planning authority may itself take the specified steps and recover the expense incurred in doing so.  A planning authority may also seek a court order requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.</P>
        <P>These enforcement powers were further strengthened in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, which allowed planning authorities to refuse to grant planning permission, without recourse to the High Court, to any developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission; if the applicant wishes to have this decision overturned, he/she will have to apply to the High Court.  An application for retention planning permission is decided on the same criteria as a normal application for planning permission, that is, a planning authority must consider the application in the context of the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies/guidelines.  Like other decisions on planning applications by planning authorities, decisions on applications for retention permission may be appealed to an Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>While I am satisfied that planning authorities have substantial powers of enforcement, I am aware of concerns about the effectiveness of enforcement and I will continue to keep the operation of Part VIII under scrutiny to ensure its effective implementation.</P>

        <P>The Irish Government has consistently made clear that such shipments are unwelcome, and seeks and obtains assurances from shipping States that such shipments will not enter Irish territorial waters and that they comply with the stringent system of regulation established in line with internationally agreed standards and practices. It is a matter for the Coast Guard Service to determine and carry out any monitoring or other requirements in respect of these shipments.

	<P>It is a function of each local authority to manage the administration of its affordable housing schemes, including consideration of any issues that may arise in relation to legal powers.  My Department was aware of the approach being considered by the City Council which has, I understand, been discussed by the elected members on a number of occasions.</P>
        <P>I further understand that, following a meeting of the Council last night, while a temporary suspension of the application process has been put in place, applications for affordable housing will continue to be accepted and will be included on their list with effect from 1 October 2008.  This will facilitate a more reliable and efficient system, which will be of greater benefit to affordable housing applicants in the longer term.</P>

	<P>The making and amending of rent schemes is the responsibility of local authorities as an integral part of their housing management functions, subject to broad principles laid down by my Department in Circular letter HRT 3/2002 of 6 March 2002.  Decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income, including the living alone allowance and the fuel allowance, for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority.  I have no plans at this time to issue a directive to local authorities in the matter. However, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s statement on housing policy &mdash; Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, I will continue to keep existing rent determination systems under review to ensure that they remain equitable.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s long-established policy on housing is to enable every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment and, as far as possible, at the tenure of its choice.  Our approach to achieving this policy objective is that those who can afford to do so should provide for their own housing, with the aid of certain fiscal incentives or subsidies and that those unable to access housing in this way should have access to social housing or income support to rent private housing.</P>
        <P>The housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013 and Towards 2016 support this strategy and have been effective in delivering increased outputs. The NDP provides the resources &mdash; some &euro;18 billion in total &mdash; which will support increased social and affordable housing output including the provision of 60,000 new social homes and 40,000 affordable units.  While many of the 40,000 households benefiting from affordable measures may avail of mortgages from private financial institutions, substantial resources are being made available through the Housing Finance Agency to fund local authority loan finance for low income households to ensure that access to finance is not an obstacle to home ownership for this group. Income limits apply to these loans to ensure effective targeting of resources and the maximum loan available is &euro;185,000. These income and loan limits are currently under review.</P>

	<P>Detailed information on the number of houses built by housing authorities is available in my Department&rsquo;s Annual and Quarterly Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.environ.ie and in the Oireachtas Library.  The 2005 assessment of need for social housing indicated that there were 43,684 households on local authority housing waiting lists.  More comprehensive data in relation to the 2005 assessment is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Record levels of funding for social and affordable housing are being provided in 2008 with over &euro;2.5 billion available for housing programmes generally.  The total Exchequer provision for social housing in 2008 is some &euro;1.57 billion &mdash; an increase of approximately 13% on the 2007 outturn. This funding will allow for the commencement of a significant number of new social housing units, further progress under regeneration programmes, and the completion of a large number of units under both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes.</P>
        <P>Good progress is being made on the delivery of social housing programmes with some 9,000 new social housing starts achieved in 2007.

The resources being made available for social housing under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 will allow for the needs of some 60,000 households to be met over the full period of the Plan.  Local authorities are currently carrying out the 2008 needs assessment, the results of which will be published in due course.</P>

	<P>Chapter 6 of my Department&rsquo;s Draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas deals specifically with small towns and villages with a population of between 400 and 5,000 people. The guidelines state that there should be no significant development in small towns and villages in the absence of an adopted local area plan. The guidelines also state that local authorities should facilitate individual residential development proposals which would increase the housing stock of the town or village by a maximum of 10% to 15% over the period of a development plan or local area plan: they do not propose to limit development in small towns and villages to 10 to 15 houses per annum.   For example, in the case of a town of 5,000 people with an approximate housing stock of 2,000 housing units, the guidelines recommend that the maximum size of any individual new housing scheme proposal should not exceed 300 dwellings over the plan period.</P><Col N="718"/>
        <P>The draft guidelines also state that the provision of infrastructure, such as water and waste water services, should be a key consideration for local authorities when considering proposals for new residential developments.  The draft guidelines issued for public consultation on 10 February 2008 and the consultation period closes on 6 May 2008.

	<P>All housing authorities have transferred cases from Rent Supplement to the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) since the commencement of transfers in September 2005. To date, over 11,400 households with long-term housing need have been accommodated in either voluntary, or other social housing options or in private rented accommodation, with the latter meeting the needs of some 3,246 of these households, details of which are set out in the table.</P>
        <P>RAS is at the mid-point in its initial implementation period and the experience to-date is that the level of rents payable under RAS is determined by negotiations between the landlord and the local authority, taking account of rent supplement levels and local market conditions. In negotiating with landlords to bring properties into RAS, local authorities obtain reductions on existing rents where possible. Since the commencement of transfers in September 2005 the pace of delivery has steadily increased and the level of expenditure increased accordingly from &euro;0.723m in 2005, to &euro;6.2m in 2006 and &euro;27.384 m in 2007.  &euro;51m is being provided to local authorities for the current year for the scheme.  Expenditure on the Rent Supplement scheme is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently carrying out a Value for Money and Policy Review of the Rental Accommodation Scheme which is due for completion in May 2008. A specific aim of the review is to evaluate the operation of RAS in the light of the objectives set for it, including the financial arrangements under which the scheme operates, and set these against alternative social housing options and the rent for properties compared with the Department of Social and Family Affairs rent caps.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s approach in relation to radon measurement and remediation is similar to that of the majority of EU Member States. Our efforts, together with those of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are concentrated on increasing public awareness of the health risks posed by radon exposure in the home and workplace, and on advising householders and others to address the risk by having measurements taken and most importantly, by remediating their premises where necessary. </P>
        <P>Accordingly, there is no financial assistance provided for radon testing. A householder can have a radon measurement carried out by a radon measurement service provider. The RPII is among the providers. A radon measurement kit may cost as little as &euro;40. Information on radon, including a map of high risk radon areas, is available from the RPII website at www.rpii.ie.  Householders, especially those in high radon areas, are encouraged to take radon measurements and to remediate where advised.</P>

	<P>Statutory responsibility for the monitoring, management, protection and improvement of water quality, including groundwater, is assigned to local authorities, acting under the general supervision of the EPA, and to the EPA in the context of its licensing functions.  Pollution at former mining sites is addressed in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, which provides, inter alia, that a local authority may be appointed by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as agent of the Minister to prepare a mine rehabilitation plan, revise a mine rehabilitation plan, and/or carry out a mine rehabilitation plan.</P>

	<P>In my recent contribution to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s lecture series on climate change, I said &mdash; in a reference to the new Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security &mdash; that the &ldquo;Committee will be extremely important in forging the vital cross-party consensus, not just on targets but also on measures required to tackle climate change.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In my own presentation to the Committee on 27 February, I referred specifically to the Technical Advisory Steering Group which has been established to provide analysis to the Government on implications for Ireland of the European Commission&rsquo;s proposed greenhouse gas targets for 2020.  I indicated that, once this group had completed its work, I would bring proposals to the Committee.  I explained that I wished to make progress on this particular aspect of work, and I expressed the hope that we could discuss the matter in more detail as soon as the Committee&rsquo;s agenda permitted.  I concluded by expressing the belief that &ldquo;all Parties are genuine in their stated commitment to tackling climate change.  If that is indeed the case, we should rise above adversarial politics and show united leadership to the Irish people.  We can focus on working out our long-term targets and objectives and this committee has a vital role to play in that regard.&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The Ballyvaughan, Corofin and Doolin Sewerage Scheme is included in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 as a scheme to start construction in 2008.   I approved funding of up to &euro;6.025m for the scheme in August 2007 following my Department&rsquo;s examination of Clare County Council&rsquo;s Water Services Pricing Policy and Economic Review Reports.  I understand that the Council is currently reviewing its proposals for Doolin and is awaiting a Foreshore Licence for Ballyvaughan.  In the meantime, the Council is advancing the Corofin element of the scheme independently and has submitted Contract Documents for the treatment plant to my Department.  These are being examined as quickly as possible.   I understand that the Council itself is considering tenders for the collection system. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>In the course of the discussion on Question No. 16 of 27 February 2008, reference was made to levels of inspections and the percentage increases in inspections year on year.  As some confusion arose, particularly in ascribing data to specific years, I would like to take the opportunity to set out the position clearly.  Some 9,835 inspections of private rented accommodation were reported by local authorities in 2006, representing an increase of 44% on the corresponding figure for 2005.  While complete data for 2007 are not yet available, I indicated previously that I expected the final position to show an increase of at least 33%.  I now expect that the finalised data for 2007 will show an even bigger increase, possibly of the order of 40%.</P>
        <P>Fuller details of the number of inspections carried out in each year up to 2006 are published in my Department&rsquo;s Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins.  Similar information will be provided in the 2007 Bulletin, once finalised.  I have no doubt that the significantly increased funding being made available to local authorities for inspection activity, and the manner in which I <Col N="724"/>am increasingly linking funding allocations to actual inspections carried out, are contributing significantly to the improved performance.  I hope to be in a position to further increase the level of funding for activity in this area when making 2008 allocations later this year.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A lease is defined in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 as an instrument in writing, whether or not under seal, containing a contract of tenancy in respect of a dwelling and, therefore, comes within the jurisdiction of the Act. Tenancy registration is a matter for the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), which is an independent statutory body established under the Act.  Section 134 of the 2004 Act requires the landlord of a dwelling to apply to the PRTB to register each tenancy. Section 144 of the Act also provides powers of direction in respect of a tenancy that in the opinion of the Board ought to be registered. In addition a person found guilty of an offence under the Act, such as the provision of false and misleading information, is, on summary conviction, liable to a fine of up to &euro;3,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 and 439 together.</P>
        <P>As mentioned in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 638 of 27 November 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency is currently considering submissions received during the public consultation phase of the preparation of a comprehensive Code of Practice on Waste Water Treatment Systems.  The EPA intends to publish the document as a Code of Practice under section 76 of the EPA Act, and this code will then be cited in the Annex to Technical Guidance Document H of the Building Regulations when it is revised later this year.  The <Col N="725"/>Code of Practice sets out requirements for site suitability assessment including the density and performance of existing systems in the area and the potential impacts from adjacent single house waste water treatment systems.  This Code of Practice will update and build on the guidance already provided by my Department through Part H of the Building Regulations, circular SP5-03 regarding ground-water protection and the planning system, and the relevant provisions contained in the Water Services Act 2007.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of planning authorities to monitor the degree to which those carrying out approved developments meet their obligations to comply with the terms of planning permissions granted, and to enforce such terms where necessary.  Local authorities may also make and adopt bye-laws to require periodic inspections of septic tanks and other on-site proprietary treatment systems under the general powers available to them under the Local Government Act 2001.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 441 and 442 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland has made significant progress over the past decade in recovering and recycling waste.  Overall recovery rates have increased from 9% in 1998 to 36% in 2006.  These increases in the proportion of waste diverted from landfill have been driven by a combination of factors, including increased awareness through the Race Against Waste campaign, the implementation of pay by use policies which incentivise householders to avail of recycling facilities, the widespread provision of segregated collections for dry recyclable materials and the provision of an expanded network of bring facilities and civic amenity sites. The latest data available indicate that at the end of 2006 local authorities operated 1,919 bring banks and 86 civic amenity sites.</P>
        <P>An objective of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 is to continue support towards the provision of infrastructure that will maximise the value recovered in waste recycling.  Since 2002, my Department has allocated some &euro;120 million in capital grants to assist local authorities in the provision of recycling and recovery services. The projects assisted include bring bank networks, civic amenity sites, materials recovery, composting and biological treatment facilities. This funding is provided primarily from the Environment Fund, and is normally based on my Department meeting 75% of the cost and the relevant local authority funding the balance.  I <Col N="726"/>am committed to continuing to provide further funding to local authorities to assist them in the continued expansion of the recycling network.</P>
        <P>I am also conscious of the escalating costs to local authorities of operating the substantially increased network of recycling facilities. Since 2003 my Department has allocated some &euro;37 million to the authorities concerned towards covering  these costs.  Successful implementation of the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste will also require increased availability of source separated collections of organic waste  &mdash; (brown bin&rsquo; collections) and my Department will shortly be issuing a circular to local authorities on intensifying the roll out of segregated collections for organic waste.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 443 and 444 together.</P>
        <P>The total cost incurred to date in the development and roll-out of the electronic voting and counting system is &euro;51.3 million (including some &euro;2.6 million in respect of awareness and education initiatives).  In addition, information provided by returning officers to my Department indicates that the total annual storage costs incurred by them in respect of the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment in 2007 is some &euro;489,000, with figures for 2004, 2005 and 2006 amounting to some &euro;658,000; &euro;696,000; and &euro;706,000 respectively.  Costs incurred to date in respect of the movement of the electronic voting equipment to centralised storage arrangements are some &euro;328,000.  Further costs will be incurred in relation to the completion of these arrangements, including buy-out costs.</P>
        <P>I am at present considering the next steps to be taken in relation to this project. In this, I am taking into account the work of the Commission on Electronic Voting which has examined the system, relevant experiences and developments internationally, and the need to maintain public confidence in the electoral process, as well as the provisions in the Programme for Government relating to electoral reform generally.  My Department has not made or received enquiries or approaches, relating to other jurisdictions, along the lines referred to in the Questions.</P>

	<P>I have recently announced an electricity microgeneration programme whereby grant support to meet 50% of the initial start up costs will be made available for the installation of microgeneration systems in approximately 50 trials to be conducted nationwide.  This programme is being administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and will focus on commercial/organisational on-site generation in its initial phases.  It will subsequently concentrate on generation by individual householders.  The micro generation programme is set in the overall context of the national smart meter programme.  The roll out of smart meters, as committed to in the Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Framework and in the Programme for Government, is a central component of our strategy to improve management of demand for electricity and to achieve greater energy efficiency through use of the latest technology.</P>
        <P>The delivery of smart metering requires a collective response.  That is why I have made it a priority for my Department to participate fully in the Steering Group overseeing the roll out.  The group is chaired by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and consists of SEI, ESB Networks, ESB Customer Supply and independent suppliers.  There are also four working groups examining the complex technical aspects of smart metering including, Tariffs, Billing/Data Services, Networks and Customer Behaviour.  It remains the position that the smart meter programme will be financed under the ESB Networks Investment Programme.  With installation of meters set to begin this summer, the ultimate objective is to complete the national roll out in five years.  The recognised potential of smart metering in terms of increased energy efficiency, reduced costs, reduced harmful emissions, facilitation of micro and distributed generation and improved customer service, will deliver tangible benefits to all consumers of electricity.</P>
