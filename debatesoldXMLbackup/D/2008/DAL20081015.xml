      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, on behalf of the Government, the Minister for Finance introduced the most swingeing and savage budget in years against the background of the Government&rsquo;s decision that every citizen must now pay for its mistakes.  Yesterday, I said the country had a surplus of &euro;6 billion two years ago but now is in deficit of almost &euro;15 billion.  There are no answers as to where all that money went or how the Government has led us to this point of recession.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the course of the budget debate yesterday, we learned not only about the Government striking a blow against elderly people by taking away medical cards granted to those over 70 and how middle income families will now get screwed by taxation at every turn of the road, but also about a change in respect of the health expenses relief.  The point raised by Deputy Michael Noonan on the health expenses relief requires clarification, as the Taoiseach is aware.  Budget 2009 states in page B.6, &ldquo;Health Expenses relief will be granted at the standard rate only from 1 January 2009, with the exception of nursing home expenses which will be standard rated from 1 January 2010.&rdquo;  There is great confusion over this.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, said that the intention of  Government was to have this rated at the higher rate of tax and not at the standard one.  This seems to have been disputed by the Minister for Health and Children and I therefore want the Taoiseach to clarify it.  What will the rate be?  Will it remain at 41% or will it be reduced to 20%, which will have a devastating impact on families paying for patients in nursing homes, particularly in the Dublin area where charges can be higher than in the rest of the country? The measure is supposed to yield &euro;150 million in a full year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The marginal rate is available for the course of 2009.  The thinking behind what is to happen in 2010 and beyond relates to the review that will take place upon the fair deal scheme coming into play.  As the Deputy knows, there are currently families who must pay considerable sums of money and consequently obtain the tax relief.  The idea of the fair deal scheme is to treat everyone the same, be they in beds in private nursing homes or public nursing homes.  No one in any circumstances under the new fair deal regime will pay more than 80% of his or her income as part of the funding mechanism.  The provision should be reviewed in the context of the fact that the fair deal regime with ensure equality of treatment and that comprehensive, uniform criteria will apply to nursing home provision to deal with historic issues.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="726"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Taoiseach about page B.6 of Budget 2009, which states, &ldquo;Health Expenses relief will be granted at the standard rate only from 1 January 2009, with the exception of nursing home expenses which will be standard rated from 1 January 2010&rdquo;.  The fair deal legislation will not take effect until some time next year.  Is what I quoted a mistake?  Alternatively, is the commitment made by the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, yesterday and repeated by the Minister for Finance incorrect?  In other words, will the higher rate continue to apply and not be reduced to 20% from 1 January 2010?</P>
        <P>We do not know when the fair deal legislation will take effect, how it will be amended or the circumstances that will arise between now and its passage.  This measure has caused consternation for thousands whose elderly kith and kin are either in or are likely to be in nursing homes.  If the measure is to apply at a reduced standard rate, it will cause mayhem among families that will not be able to pay.  As Deputy Noonan pointed out yesterday, charges in Dublin can amount to &euro;60,000 per year.  They may be somewhat lower in other places around the country.</P>
        <P>Is what I quoted from page B.6 a mistake?  It should be very clear to everybody that it is a mistake and that the intention of the Government, as outlined by the Minister for Defence yesterday, is that the higher rate of tax in respect of medical expenses relief will continue to apply.  The measure in page B.6, if introduced, will affect many thousands of elderly folk and, as a consequence, their families.  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether it is a mistake and whether the rate of 41% will continue to apply in respect of medical expenses relief for patients in nursing homes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I explained to the Deputy, the measure in page B.6 assumes the full operation of the fair deal legislation by 1 January 2010.  The point I am making is that, if the fundamental reform is to take place whereby all in receipt of nursing home care will pay no more than 80% of their income, regardless of whether they are in private or public nursing homes, one will not be able to argue so rigorously that the tax incentive introduced in the first place is required.  If the new system were not to be in place, the present marginal rate would remain until the fair deal system became fully operational, at which stage we would review circumstances fully.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a decision here.  Is it now a review?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just explained that this depends on full operation of the fair deal legislation by 1 January 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>Explain it to Willie.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the situation.  In the meantime, as our true intention here is not to cause problems or concerns for people, I am making it very clear that until such time as it is fully operational, there will be no change to the marginal tax relief that is available for nursing home care because there are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, yesterday&rsquo;s statement is wrong.  We want a straight answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not wrong. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="727"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies are not prepared to allow the clarification to be made because they want to continue with some confusion.  There is no confusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is confusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The present marginal rate remains in place in respect of nursing home care for those who require it and are eligible for it until such time as the fair deal scheme is fully operational, which is a fundamental reform, as Deputies will know.  It is presumed the fair deal scheme will be fully operational by 1 January 2010.  We will review the situation and ensure that if it is fully operational, we will consider the changes that can take place, because this will not affect people.  They will not be seeking the 41% marginal tax relief at that time because the whole basis upon which their payment is made will change and that will be the same for everyone regardless of whether they are in a private or a public nursing home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not an optional scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Which of the treacherous 30 cuts and charges that were introduced in yesterday&rsquo;s budget is the Taoiseach most embarrassed by?  Is it the 1% tax on the widow who takes a part-time cleaning job to supplement her pension?  Is it the taking away of the medical card from old age pensioners?  Is it the &euro;100 charge that the parent of a sick child will now have to pay to attend accident and emergency or a hospital?  Is it the &euro;2,000 that the average middle income family will have to pay back to the Government in after-tax income as a result of yesterday&rsquo;s changes?  Is it the &euro;1,500 that the same hard-working family will have to pay in a registration fee when one of their children goes to college?  Is it the cut in child benefit or the early childhood payment?  Is it the increase in class sizes?  Is it the fact that to date the only organisation to welcome the budget is the Construction Industry Federation?</P>

	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Specifically, in respect of the withdrawal of the medical card from pensioners, I received a call this morning from a pensioner who was on VHI but qualified for the medical card when he turned 70 and stopped paying VHI.  Can that pensioner get back into VHI now and, if so, what will it cost?  What type of cover will the VHI provide to such a pensioner if he does manage to get back into it?</P>

	<P>If it is Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s contention &mdash; it was certainly Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s contention last night &mdash; that there should not have been any tax-raising revenue provisions in <Col N="728"/>the budget, what part of the expenditure programme would he cut by another &euro;2 billion?  That is what is required.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If it was also the case that he did not believe there were discretionary spends in the capital programme that should not have been deferred, what further &euro;1 billion in cuts &mdash; making a total of &euro;3 billion &mdash; would he estimate we could find in the public expenditure programme?  If we were to move, as Deputy Bruton said, to a 5.5% deficit instead of the 6.5% deficit and if we were not to raise taxes, this would require another &euro;2 billion of expenditure cuts.</P>

	<P>I want to make it clear that if this is the Fine Gael position &mdash; it was their stated public position on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last night &mdash; they are required to find another &euro;5 billion in expenditure cuts to make that budget stick.  That is the reality.</P>

	<P>Deputy Gilmore decries all the methods of raising tax revenue.  I do not believe it is the view of the Labour Party that we should cut expenditure further &mdash; I do not <Col N="729"/>think that is its position.  I have heard what Deputy Gilmore had to say in regard to some tax expenditures.  We will debate those in the House and assess their impact, and at least we can have a debate that might make sense.  However, the debate I am trying to have with the Opposition here does not make any sense because it is &euro;5 billion out before it starts.</P>

	<P>Deputy James Reilly, when he was chairman of the IMO&rsquo;s GP committee, condemned the Government&rsquo;s decision to offer medical cards to all pensioners over 70.  His position was that it was not acceptable.  Now, of course, he decries the fact that we have changed that arrangement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is proud of the fact that, when he was chairman of that GP committee, he negotiated four times the charge for people in less disadvantaged areas than in disadvantaged areas.  He effectively got a payment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>On Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s point, I very much regret that this was a necessary decision.  I would like to have been in a position to say the present situation could have continued, but it was not possible in the context of all the decisions that had to be taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Why?</P>

	<P>One moment, please.  In addition, there is &euro;1 billion in regard to the capital programme.</P>
        <P>I regret that is the situation, but we have sought to achieve that seven of every ten people over 70 will be eligible for that medical card on the means test grounds, based on the data that are available for those who were in receipt of medical card between the age of 66 and 70 and who got the card when they came to the age of 70.</P>

	<P>The very least he could do this morning for people who are suffering pain as a result of the budget is to express some degree of remorse, regret and apology to them.</P>
        <P>Second, I asked a specific question about elderly people who had health insurance, but who understandably gave it up when they got medical cards in the expectation that they would continue to have them.  The Government is now taking the medical card off them and leaving <Col N="732"/>them marooned in a situation where they will now have no medical card and no health insurance.</P>
        <P>I checked this morning with the VHI and I am told that a pensioner in those circumstances will have to wait ten years for cover for a pre-existing condition and two years for cover for a new condition.  What answer can the Taoiseach give to a person aged 75 or 76 from whom he is taking the medical card, who has stopped paying health insurance?  What comfort can he offer to them this morning about their health cover because people are worried and are ringing my office and I am sure other offices also?</P>
        <P>Third, if the Taoiseach is so convinced the people of this country accept his budget, will he put it to the test?  Will the Taoiseach move the writ for the by-election that is due in Dublin South and put his budget to the test of the people of that constituency at least?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept for a moment that I forgot it because the complaint from the Labour Party benches in each of the past three budgets was that I was not spending enough.  I recall in regard to the Labour Party&rsquo;s manifesto that Deputy Quinn was calling for a hugely increased capital investment programme way beyond what we are providing, which will still be between 5% and 6% of GNP next year, in line with the NDP commitment.  That was Deputy Quinn&rsquo;s position.  That would have meant higher taxes.  Deputy Quinn is entitled to put that view.  He put it to the test and it did not work.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore made a point about elderly people losing health cover.  People are entitled to hospital services.  The vast majority of VHI services &mdash; up to 95% &mdash; relate to hospital services.  Deputy Gilmore may be able to show me some aspect of a plan relating to GP services.  Those people are still entitled to be looked after in hospitals and acute services should they require them.</P>

	<P>We are continuing with that scheme.  It is only fair to say that because of the difficulties we face, unfortunately, it is not possible in the present situation to provide universal entitlement in respect of all of these matters, as was the case in the past.  The great majority of the advances we have made for the elderly have been protected in the budget and can be protected for the future.  We can say that, and we can point to real improvements both in terms of the extension of age exemption limits in regard to increasing the pension and the supplementary entitlements.  All of those benefits have been quite rightly provided to the elderly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about protecting to the greatest extent possible the progress that Ireland has made over the past decade.  It is about ensuring that Ireland has a solid basis for economic recovery when world economic conditions improve.  Every Deputy in the House, stepping outside the confines of adversarial party politics, recognises that we are in extraordinary economic circumstances.  The global economic and financial climate means we face stark choices.  If we do not make the right choices there will be catastrophic consequences for the future prospects of the economy and we will threaten the livelihood of current and future generations of people.</P>
        <P>The turmoil in international financial markets provides the backdrop against which this budget has been framed.  No one yet knows the full extent of these adverse developments or how quickly stability can be restored.  It is not credible to suggest that any government could ensure the winds of global recession which are battering at the door of every other nation would by-pass this country.  We must deal with realities as they are, not as we might like them to be.  Ireland is an open economy and we depend on exports as a major driver of our economic success.  In good times we benefited more than proportionally from the benign world conditions.  In these difficult times we are being severely impacted by these stormy international conditions.  The first requirement, therefore, is to seek to stabilise the current situation and chart a pathway back to economic recovery in the coming years.</P>
        <P>Unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures.  The first such measure was to bring the budget forward from the usual December date to yesterday.  Fiscal stability has been central to Ireland&rsquo;s economic success of recent years.  It has been the firm foundation for building an enterprising economy which rewards hard work but also has a strong social provision.  The second major decision was to take decisive action to secure our banking system.  We need a strong banking system to support our economy and to support hard-pressed families and businesses.</P>
        <P>Up to this year, the economy was growing year on year and hundreds of thousands of jobs were created, which brought in increased tax.  We used that money to reform our income tax system and reduce tax on workers and businesses and invested heavily to address the underinvestment of the past by providing better public services in health, education, social welfare and other areas, and investing in capital infrastructure to build up the country and meet the demands of a growing country.  While doing all this, we put more than &euro;20 billion into the National Pensions Reserve Fund to help provide for the future and we halved the national debt in a decade.  That decade is now over and those improvements are there for all to see.  We made sure that more working families retained a greater part of their income than was ever the case before.</P><Col N="736"/>
        <P>This year, the rapid slowdown in the global economy and the downturn in the housing market have dramatically reduced the revenue available to run public services.  The 2009 budget is the most crucial budget in modern times.  Our tax revenues this year were significantly less than budgeted for because of the sharp slowdown in economic activity.  In 2007, we achieved 6% growth and this year growth has contracted by approximately 1.5%.  To deal with this sharp deterioration in public finances as a result of that reduced activity, we have chosen a direction based not on soft options, quick fixes or political expediency.  Sound and stable public finances are a prerequisite to the delivery of long-term economic and social improvements.</P>
        <P>The approach has to be sufficient to restore stability, yet measured such that it does not accelerate the economic slowdown.  The budget arithmetic achieves this balance through a combination of targeted reductions in spending and measured approaches to increasing revenue.  It addresses the budgetary challenge in 2009 and, importantly, paves the way for healthier and more sustainable fiscal outturns in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>We are raising tax revenue by close on &euro;2 billion in net terms to keep within our financial targets and we are cutting expenditure.  Significantly, we will have to continue to work to reduce the current budget deficit which will stand at more than &euro;4.7 billion even after the budget changes.</P>
        <P>On the capital side we are still investing heavily in Ireland&rsquo;s future.  The priorities of the national development plan have been maintained.  The pace of improvement, evident in recent years, will continue.  Taking direct Exchequer funding of &euro;8.2 billion and a public private partnership contribution of somewhat less than &euro;1 billion, total capital investment next year will be &euro;9.2 billion or 5.4% of gross national product.  This is in keeping with our commitment in the national development plan to keep capital spending during these years at between 5% and 6% of gross national product.  In the past, all our capital spending came out of cash surpluses.  Now we have to borrow, but that is totally defensible because of the economic rate of return we receive from the investment we envisage in the next year on capital.  This is prioritising the spend on areas where there is an economic return in the short term on transport and environmental infrastructure and in the longer term in respect of education and research and development investment.  This significant investment in transport, research and development, environmental services and communications will enhance the competitiveness of our economy and drive future economic progress.</P>
        <P>Given the very rapid increase in expenditure on services in the past ten years, it is not unreasonable that we should reduce the pace of growth in the short term, when this is clearly in our long-term interest.  In this period of global economic crisis, it is easy to lose sight of what Ireland has achieved.  We must consolidate that now and build for the future by continuing to invest so that we can increase productivity and be more competitive.</P>
        <P>When times were good, we invested wisely in schools, roads, public transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The average industrial wage has also risen substantially.  There are now more than 2 million people working in the country despite rises in unemployment during the past year, and, unfortunately, further rises in unemployment are predicted next year.  Our completion rates for second and third level education are among the highest in the European Union.  It is a key priority to protect this solid base of achievement to the greatest extent we possibly can in these circumstances.</P>
        <P>We are determined to keep our focus on making sure that we come out of these difficult times as quickly and strongly as we can.</P>

	<P>If there is one thing we should all learn from the past, it is that the worst policy of all and the one which causes the most damage to people is to pretend that tough action can be taken without people feeling the impact.</P>
        <P>The only way to provide quality public services and to maximise support for the less well off is to get us back to strong public finances as quickly as feasible and take the actions required to achieve that objective.  With revenues down &euro;6.5 billion this year, it would simply not be responsible if we did not adapt the level of public services being provided.  Policy changes had to be considered and had to take account of the fact that the Government will have less revenue next year than was anticipated before the international downturn hit us.</P>

	<P>The great Homer must have nodded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We must take a balanced approach, significantly reducing the rate of expenditure on current day-to-day spending from 10% this year to 3.8% next year, by deferring discretionary capital spending, including holding off on further land acquisition and building on the decentralisation programme until the 6,000 public servants who are ready to relocate are in place in the next couple of years.  We also had to consider and make decisions on raising taxes by &euro;2 billion in net terms to end up with a general government deficit which is still high at 6.5% of gross domestic product.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael finance spokesman said last night that Fine Gael would not raise taxes but would bring in a budget with a 5.5% deficit.  That can only mean it is in favour of further expenditure cuts totalling more than &euro;4 billion because to reduce the deficit from 6.5% to 5.5% would cost more than &euro;2 billion and Deputy Bruton disagrees with our tax raising measures which cost another &euro;2 billion.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and would involve making political decisions at this time which would simply be untenable.  I agree we must move to eliminate the current budget deficit to finally establish a long-term sustainable path, whereby day-to-day expenditure corresponds to tax receipts.  As tax revenues are 10% less than expected for this year, with little improvement in that position assumed for next year, that can only be done progressively over time.</P><Col N="738"/>
        <P>I wish to comment further on the matter raised by Deputy Gilmore during Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  I am conscious of the sacrifices people will make as a result of yesterday&rsquo;s budget.  If we begin a process of correction now and stick with it in the years ahead, we will provide the best means of protecting our prosperity and supporting the vulnerable in the years to come.  We have done our utmost to adhere to the principle of fairness in making our budgetary decisions.  When money is less plentiful, we must divert it to those who are most in need.  The contributions people make to the cost of public services must be structured in line with their ability to pay.</P>
        <P>We have increased the income tax band to ensure that workers on modest incomes do not pay tax at the higher rate as a result of standard pay increases.  We have structured the necessary income levy to ensure that those on higher incomes will pay more.  We have capped the tax benefits of pension contributions at a significantly reduced level of earnings.  In that way, we will ensure we do not provide subsidies to those who are not in need.  People on modest incomes are sheltered from the necessary increases in charges.  The criticisms of the income levy from Opposition Deputies ring hollow when one considers that when they were in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Since that time, when the Opposition parties charged a 26% rate, we have introduced reforms to the tax system which have taken 500,000 workers out of the tax net altogether.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition parties imposed a 26% charge when they were in government, whereas we are asking for a 1% levy at these difficult times.  The system we propose will ensure that those on high incomes will pay the levy on their gross income and cannot shelter that income from the levy.  That is progressive &mdash; as one earns more, one pays more.  If we <Col N="739"/>were to increase tax rates, for example, by adding 1% to the standard band and 2% to the higher band, we would not accrue the volume of money required, or achieve the outcome the levy will achieve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government wasted the money it had.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are providing a package of over &euro;515 million to protect pensioners and other social welfare recipients from the effects of inflation.  There is a widespread acceptance that expenditure on child benefit does not achieve an appropriate degree of balance.  Therefore, it is right to signal the phasing out of child benefit in respect of 18 year olds in full-time education.  Young people from families that depend on social welfare are specifically taken into account in the compensatory measures announced by the Minister, however.  Similarly, the changes announced in respect of the medical card for people over the age of 70 are not unreasonable.  The entire older population, with the exception of 5% of them who have the highest incomes, will continue to have access to a medical card, a doctor-only card or a grant towards GP expenses.  Of every 100 older people, 94 will get a medical card, a doctor&rsquo;s card or the &euro;400 grant.  The rest of them will not qualify because they have a pension of more than &euro;650 per week.  The contributory State pension is &euro;230.30 per week and the non-contributory pension is &euro;219 per week.</P>
        <P>The Government will enable progress to be continued in developing all levels of the education system in an appropriate manner.  It will increase capitation grants, expenditure on research and development capacity at third level and specific supports for children at school with disabilities.  The budget also delivers on our commitment to use fiscal mechanisms to encourage environmental improvement.  The credibility and success of the Government&rsquo;s budgetary strategy is increased when the behaviour of people across the economy reflects and reinforces the underlying approach to budgetary choices.  The budget is compatible with the social partnership process and the draft agreement.  It secures stability in the public finances, defends those who are most vulnerable and distributes the burden of adjustment as fairly as possible.  I ask for the support of the social partners in navigating through this difficult time for their members and the rest of the country.</P>
        <P>The decisions announced yesterday will have specific implications for the public service.  It has been suggested that there has been an unreasonable and excessive explosion in public service numbers, but the facts suggest otherwise.  While Ireland compares well to other OECD countries in this regard, present circumstances require that we achieve more for less.  We are not interested in merely being in line with OECD averages in terms of staffing levels and performance.  We must move from average to best.  We must display the highest rates of productivity increase, the strongest indicators of quality outcomes, the smartest application of new technologies and the closest attention to the diverse needs of our citizens.  At a time of severe economic and fiscal challenge, the efficiency and effectiveness with which public services are organised and delivered is critically important.  The budget reflects the decisions the Government has already taken to focus spending on areas of greatest priority and to reduce sharply activities which are not essential in the present circumstances.  We intend to reduce significantly expenditure on consultancies and to curtail severely expenditure on advertising and other support activities.  Measures to transform the management of procurement across the public service are also in train and will yield significant savings.</P>
        <P>There is clear and overwhelming evidence that our public servants deeply resent the fact that under-performance is tolerated and protected.  They are frustrated, as others are, when their practical experience of service delivery is not reflected in the development of policy.  There is great talent and an impatience for reform in many quarters of the public service.  We need to liberate that talent and fast-track the process of reform.  Pressure of resources can <Col N="740"/>contribute to the creative solution to these challenges.  The budget provides for a 4% reduction in the public service payroll, relative to 2008.  This challenging target will be built on with targets for further efficiency gains over subsequent years.  Our public servants are relatively well paid.  In return, they must accept the need for openness to change and innovation on a par with the most competitive aspects of the private sector.  They must show flexibility and be willing to meet the rigours of performance management and external accountability.  In their deployment and activity, they must focus on the service of the citizen, which is what matters the most.</P>
        <P>The modernisation of the public service and the drive for greater efficiency and effectiveness were the Government&rsquo;s central requirements during the recent negotiations on a new public service pay agreement.  The full and comprehensive delivery of that agenda is central to the policies and priorities of this Administration.  The public service and its trade unions recognise that the public deserves and demands nothing less than a full and transparent renewal of the public service, at all levels and in all sectors.  In the weeks to come, the Minister for Finance and I will announce specific measures arising from the work of the task force on public sector reform.  There will be a rigorous appraisal of staffing levels, underpinned by external expertise, so that public service managers are supported in their efforts to ensure that available resources are appropriately aligned with priority needs.  This can be achieved in partnership by applying the terms of the draft agreement that was negotiated recently.  In any event, such changes are essential and will be pursued vigorously by the Government.  The decision by the members of the Government and the Secretaries General of the various Departments to waive voluntarily 10% of their income was a symbolic move rather than a gimmick.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>

	<P>Did Deputy Bannon agree to take a wage cut?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Symbolic gestures are important in a community of citizens.  We build our civic culture through actions which underline our intentions and our meaning.  In this instance, our intention was to show our appreciation of the difficult times many of our citizens will experience in the period ahead.  The gesture is an acknowledgement that, in a small society, we depend on each other.  Each of us depends on the efforts and supports of others.  I refer to people in the public and private sectors; workers and employers; and people who have recently arrived in this country and those who are rooted in a strong local Irish identity.  The impact of change and challenge in the months to come will depend on how well we can reflect the common good in our actions and decisions.  One thing that is certain, as we face the most serious global economic circumstances for almost a century, is that these times will pass.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>So will this Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When that happens, Ireland needs to be in a position to take advantage.  I want to make it clear that Ireland&rsquo;s future is bright.  It has been said that the only safe ship in a storm is leadership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has brought us on to the rocks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government will show leadership by managing the economy through this international downturn and on to a path to economic recovery.  A time of serious adversity can be a time of great opportunity.  In the cycle of any economy, there is a time for renewal and change.  The basis for this economic renewal will be the achievements of the past ten years.  Yet during difficult times it is tempting to batten down the hatches and wait until the storm is <Col N="741"/>over before figuring out where to go next.  However, we must not and we will not have our attention diverted from putting in place the necessary building blocks so that Ireland can take advantage of the inevitable upswing in the global economy.</P>
        <P>In the current challenging circumstances, the Government is acutely aware of the key role of business in driving economic growth and providing secure, quality employment.  Ireland has enjoyed extraordinary economic success, in part as a result of providing a highly favourable business environment.  The latest World Doing Business report ranks us seventh out of 182 countries as a place to do business, the fifth easiest place to establish a business and the third cheapest location for business start-up regulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>And the only country in Europe in a recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Nevertheless, the Government is absolutely committed to measures to build on this success.</P>
        <P>One of the important messages of this budget is that Ireland is very much open for business.  Despite the severe financial and economic difficulties emerging across the global economy, there is still a strong enterprise sector which is world-class in its capacity and performance.  It is underpinned by the rapidly-evolving scientific, technological and innovation base that is at the heart of our enterprise policy.  With access to a highly-skilled and flexible labour force, this enterprise economy is well placed for further growth and development.  For that reason, it is essential that we maintain an attractive environment for overseas investment, especially in the more innovative and higher value-added sectors of the global economy.</P>
        <P>With that in mind, I will be travelling to China next week as part of our overall efforts to sustain and develop new market opportunities for Ireland and Irish companies.  China is increasingly becoming one of the most significant markets globally, and appears to be better positioned than many to see out the current economic difficulties.  I will have a bilateral meeting with Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and I expect to discuss the continued development of bilateral relations between our two countries.  I will lead a trade development mission of over 100 Irish companies, all of whom are expanding their trading opportunities in China. We will also be exploring opportunities for greater Chinese investment in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Of equal importance to foreign direct investment is the stimulation of business start-ups and the expansion of indigenous enterprise.  A particular priority is development which captures the full economic benefit of the knowledge and innovation created with the support of public investment in education and research and development.</P>
        <P>In looking to the future, we can take confidence from the past.  The basis of Ireland&rsquo;s past economic growth is also that which will fuel our future recovery, namely, the talent of our own people.  Our people will always be the most critical ingredient in our performance.  We have one of the youngest and best educated workforces in Europe.  It is their ingenuity and creativity which will drive the next phase of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development.  That is the Irish advantage, and we must never lose it.  Building the stock of knowledge and know-how is critical.  The budget&rsquo;s increased support for investment in research and development through the corporate tax system, as well as the incentives for companies in their early years to retain profits to invest in development, are strategically important.  Combined with our commitment to the continuing rapid development of a competitive infrastructure, it is clear that the Government remains strongly pro-enterprise and that this is a pro-enterprise budget.</P>
        <P>We will continue to consider measures to encourage further research and development, as well as innovation and commercialisation by private enterprise.  This will enable Ireland to move up the value chain so that we assert ourselves not only as an open enterprise economy, but also an open entrepreneurial economy.  This is a crucial basis for our future economic and <Col N="742"/>social development.  A great lesson from the last century of Irish history is that self-sufficiency and protectionism are outmoded economic ideologies.  This country, as a small island, must face outwards.  For our people to prosper, we need international markets, foreign investment and strong trading links.</P>
        <P>It would be wrong of me, in the context of the current difficult economic times, not to mention my strongly held view that our prospects are absolutely interwoven with our membership of and participation in the European Union.  Our membership of the euro has facilitated a diversification of trade, a reduction in the costs of business transactions, and a stable interest rate and currency environment.  The European Central Bank is playing a vital role in supporting banks through measures such as the provision of credit and the recent interest rate reduction.  On Sunday, the euro zone countries agreed on a comprehensive suite of measures to enable each of them to take action in a co-ordinated manner, but tailored to suit their specific circumstances.</P>
        <P>I firmly believe that Ireland must remain at the heart of Europe.  We advance our interests not by going solo, but by working with like-minded others on problems, challenges and opportunities that can only be dealt with effectively by working across national borders.  Pooling our sovereignty with others is not the same as giving it away, but in any relationship of mutual interdependence, there must be give and take.  We should not place ourselves in a position where our European partners view us as obstructing the progress they might wish to see for themselves, without properly assessing the consequences for us.  Unfortunately, the result of our referendum on the Lisbon treaty has the potential to do just that.  I will resolutely lead our efforts to address the concerns expressed during the referendum not just for Europe, but for Ireland within Europe.  I am convinced that our economic and social well-being will be better served by such a resolution, especially in the troubled times in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>We must learn from our past experiences during difficult economic times.  The business of government is about making choices.  I have great confidence in the wisdom of the Irish people to take the long-term view and understand why we have made the difficult choices that we have made.  The alternatives were more unpalatable.  The future prosperity of our people is the Government&rsquo;s primary concern.  Ireland has a good economic future beyond the current difficulties.  Our actions this week and in the coming weeks and months will provide the basis for Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery from this recession.  The Irish people have faced considerable adversity in the past and yet our creativity, ingenuity, patriotism and sense of purpose have delivered great success, and will deliver it again.</P>
        <P>I wish to state clearly that the Government has chosen its course.  No matter how difficult the decisions, we will not waiver from acting in the long-term interests of current and future generations.  I believe that the budget presented by the Minister for Finance provides a clear policy direction, a set of specific measures, and a framework of principles to guide us in the period ahead.  I ask the Irish people to stay the course, and with hard work and determination, we will get through these difficult times and onto a path towards economic recovery and renewal.</P>

	<P>Nobody has answered the fundamental question here.  Two years ago, this country was &euro;6 billion in surplus.  It is now &euro;15 billion in debt.  I accept that there have been improvements in infrastructure and so on, but the people on that side of the House did not take into account the warning signs that were there for many years of what could happen if provision was not made for a crash that might follow a period of boom.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say that the workers of Ireland built the Celtic tiger.  It was built through exports, trade and manufacturing, but it got diverted down the road of property-based wealth, driven by Fianna F&aacute;il in particular.</P>

	<P>And its pals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday&rsquo;s budget has come against the background of a move from a &euro;6 billion surplus to a &euro;15 billion deficit in the space of two years.  That is unprecedented anywhere in Europe.  It was done because the Government allowed the competitiveness of the country to slip seriously over the last few years.  We lost export share as we put all our hopes in the creation of wealth through the property bubble and ended up with the most exposed financial sector in Europe.  The Taoiseach came into the House yesterday and had the Minister for Finance read out a Budget Statement that makes every person in the country pay for the Government&rsquo;s mistakes and pay for its waste.  There is nowhere anybody can turn now but they face down the barrel of some tax or other.  The Taoiseach funked it yesterday when he had an opportunity to lay out his plans based on the OECD report or based on what he intended to do for public sector reform.  This budget did not mention the detail of how that will be applied.</P>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s budget was disgraceful in what it contained and it was deplorable in what it did not contain.  The response it elicited was quite fascinating.  Never before have I seen such a universal rejection of a budget.  One by one the statements came out.  Groups such as IBEC, ISME, ICTU, SIPTU, Aer Lingus, Ryanair, ASH, hospital personnel, the Irish Hotels Federation, Focus Ireland, Barnardos, all criticised this budget.  Companies, trade unions and interest groups who have never before agreed, found themselves unified in universal and total rejection <Col N="744"/>of the budget.  I could not believe that not one single agency, organisation, company or union had anything positive to say.  Then late in the evening, just one positive and enthusiastic response appeared.  One single, solitary organisation welcomed the budget and that was the Construction Industry Federation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. Parlon did not change his spots.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to see that the Government is at least consistent.  In good times and bad it keeps things constant; it may disappoint the nation, but it never disappoints the construction industry.  </P>
        <P>I also put forward the view that there should not be any cut in the capital programme and workers, tradespeople and craftsmen could be transferred from the collapsed residential housing sector into other areas of the construction industry such as schools, roads and other infrastructure projects.  The problem is that the major party in Government, Fianna F&aacute;il, has been in office for more than ten years.  It has claimed credit on every occasion that the sun shone.  However, the Government fell asleep in that comfort zone and became immune to the realities of what is happening on the street.  It ignored the warning signs that were put up in flares for long enough on a range of issues.  The Government has been too lazy, too stale, too arrogant, too out of touch with the pressured lives of the mortgaged poor.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Finance, having already likened himself to the American President who dragged his nation out of a depression, went even further in his presumption, in his out of touch impertinence; he called for patriotism when the Government expects every person to pay for its wanton waste and its playing free and easy and reckless with the economy and the taxes of the people.  Instead of spending the next few days spinning this disaster to the media, the Taoiseach should try meeting some of the people who are now impoverished, whose standard of living will drop, who are being punished.  He should try telling these exhausted men and women about the patriotic action they are taking today in paying for the Government&rsquo;s outrageous and reckless mistakes.</P>
        <P>I can promise the Taoiseach if he does this, he will get a short, two-word answer from them.  It is very easy for a Government that stopped listening to reality a long time ago to talk about patriotism.  However, if it matches its high-flown words to the real world outside this House it will quickly find that brand of patriotism rejected with heavy losses.  The people know how badly they have been served.  They know the Taoiseach and the Government he struggles to lead have achieved the unbelievable; they have produced disaster out of success.  They have turned a surplus of &euro;6 billion into a &euro;15 billion deficit.  For the first time in the history of the State they have reversed progress and condemned hard working people and families to a lower living standard than their parents and in some cases, their grandparents enjoyed.  The Government has reversed the standard of living and the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of families.  That is some achievement by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in a short time.  They have switched this country from a position of surplus to massive deficit.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach shmoozed his way through the last four budgets, dispensing gifts of government expenditure to all and sundry, without any regard to the consequences.  Everything was sound.  Anybody who mentioned any difficulties with this economy was guilty of national sabotage and talking down our country.  Last May, when the Taoiseach was still claiming that the fundamentals of the economy were sound, what planet was this Government living on?  The Taoiseach was asked at the time to explain his economic rescue plan.  He knew we were facing financial difficulties of the most serious type.  There was no response from the Taoiseach.  Yesterday&rsquo;s budget did not reveal any plan.  It is a series of tax levies and tax takes on every <Col N="745"/>taxpayer and worker.  Yesterday&rsquo;s budget fixed no fundamental problems and it ensured no future.  It is without hope, without aspiration or without inspiration and it does not offer any enthusiasm to anybody with any initiative.  It is a pick-and-mix punishment to a hardworking nation.  One of the headlines in a newspaper today states: &ldquo;All pain but no gain&rdquo;.  It is a desperate budget introduced by a desperate Government.  This is panic, not policy; it is denial, not direction.</P>
        <P>The Government has tried to hide its miserable performance behind the international banking crisis.  Every time a television is turned on, the excuse is that it is America, Japan, China or Europe.  People have become blurred with the trillions and billions and the economic statistics.  We all know the difficulties that are so complex for so many countries as a result of the international banking and global situation.  We know the Government did not cause this crisis and it is not responsible for the sub-prime sector in the United States which is another word for reckless spending but it is responsible for the reckless spending in this economy.  The Taoiseach should not try to tell the House that the international global financial position is responsible for the costs associated with doing business here, for the fact the Government has never opened up competition, from Dublin Bus to the provision of broadband, to the provision of energy, to the regulation in all this area.  The Government has allowed a situation to apply where it is now one of the costliest countries in the eurozone in which to do business, despite the references in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech to easy setting up costs for companies.  The Taoiseach has allowed a situation to come about where it is virtually impossible to do business, between regulation, cost and the beating down of small businesses.  Before this time next year, there will be hundreds of retail outlets closed down because they cannot pay the commercial water charges, never mind meet the commercial rates being applied by local authorities.  The answer from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been to change the light bulbs and give people bicycles.</P>

	<P>A total of 50,000 people joined the dole queues this year, the first year of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s leadership and 100,000 more will join those dismal queues next year.  The social welfare bill will rise by approximately &euro;10,000 a month.  Businesses the length and breadth of this country are fighting for survival and as the foreclosure figures this week proved many of them are not succeeding.  Couples whose dream was to own their own home are now paying more for a home worth hundreds of thousands less than they paid for it and in many cases they were seduced into buying by a market controlled by profligate lending institutions.  What did the Government do for these families and young people?  </P>

	<P>The Minister slapped a 1% levy on their shrinking incomes.  He raised VAT rates and these will apply in every household.  He increased the price of petrol so that last night lines of cars were drawn up outside every garage as hard-pressed workers tried to fill the tanks of their cars before that extra cost came in.  The Minister raised their motor tax, cut what they could reclaim on their medical expenses and added &euro;10 to every air flight they take.  The 16 people who left my town for Australia would have paid that were they here today.  The other young people leaving this country on the emigrant aeroplane to seek work in countries where it is available will be taxed for flying out of Ireland. The Minister hiked hospital charges to make it more difficult for people to bring their sick children to accident and emergency departments.  He reduced their mortgage relief and the relief on money they are trying to put into their pensions.  He slapped &euro;300 extra on secondary school bus tickets and &euro;600 on third <Col N="746"/>level registration fees and reduced child benefit on over 18s by 50%, which is despicable given that the mothers of Ireland in the main have raised their children to that point.</P>

	<P>That is what the Minister did yesterday to middle income families.  Everywhere they turn there is a tax or levy.  They are faced with increased taxation by Fianna F&aacute;il in government.  This is a declaration of war on the middle classes.  It is also a war on the future.  The Minister has driven a stake through the heart of education.  The Government went around the country last year holding public meetings where thousands of people turned up.  To these meetings it sent Ministers&rsquo; representatives and letters, pledging to reduce class sizes because it believed in giving parents, teachers and children the best opportunity to provide for the future.  The Government has driven a stake through that and its collapse of its commitment to decrease class sizes at a time of pressure like this is contradictory to what has just been said, that the Government wants to build a knowledge future with well qualified, confident young people who are able to stand on their own feet against their peers from around the world.  That cannot be done with increasing class sizes and the withdrawal of teachers of English in classes where many students have no English, which Deputy Hanafin was forced to pledge when she was Minister for Education and Science.  The Government has made it harder on middle-income and lower-income families and on children in the primary sector, who will struggle even more as they go through secondary school and up to when they must compete internationally.</P>
        <P>The claims that the Government wants to build a knowledge economy are not worth the paper they are written on.  They are like most other Fianna F&aacute;il promises, broken promises.  It was an election winner to say we wanted to become a knowledge economy.  The Ministers should go around the country &mdash; as many of them do, or are driven around the country &mdash; and look at the lack of broadband and communications capacity to do business.  They should examine the structure of IT facilities in schools and the reneging on the &euro;252 million in the programme for Government that was to be spent on that.  They should look at the divergence of capacity and skill level across the educational spectrum.  If the Government bothered to look, it would see that we struggle and yesterday&rsquo;s decision will make it even worse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy Bruton, described the budget as hitting &ldquo;any family and every family, any business and every business&rdquo;.  He is right, just as he was right in recent years when he highlighted the failure to manage soaring Government expenditure, the failure to reform the public sector when the need for reform was clear, the danger of building spending programmes on the back of  temporary tax windfalls from an overheating property market and the failure to take hard decisions.  Deputy Bruton pointed those out.  Yesterday I read his critique of the 2002 budget.  It is very similar to the present position, except this situation is even worse.  Similar warnings came from the IMF, the OECD, the ESRI and the Central Bank.  Anybody could have seen these warning signs.  Ten years ago in County Clare a young economist, Mr. David McWilliams, predicted seven years of plenty followed by a period of bust when five principal elements would apply, such as breaking the growth and stability pact, the destruction of the housing sector and the collapse of the banks.  The Government and the Taoiseach did nothing about it.  The Taoiseach did laps of honour when his predecessor left and he was entitled to some lap of honour on taking up office.  He took the ball from European business and his speech here about being at the heart of Europe is very far from Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s effort in that campaign last summer.</P>

	<P>The result of yesterday&rsquo;s efforts is that taxpayers are punch drunk.  Everywhere they go they will have to pay.  The Government is making every person pay for what has happened.  This should have been stopped before now.  The recent Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report highlighted the ludicrous extent of waste in the HSE, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a range of other Departments, but the Government did nothing about that.  Yesterday&rsquo;s response regarding the HSE and the public service is merely that there will be a redundancy programme.</P>
        <P>The Government has parked decentralisation.  We believe in well managed and planned decentralisation, but the plan to move 10,000 public servants to 53 locations within three years was turned into a shambles.  The Government has made a list of places that are in limbo until 2011.  It is funny that it should be 2011, a year before a general election.  I suppose the Government will throw up that flare again and expect people to believe it, as on this occasion.  Last week Deputy Mitchell asked questions on arts, sport and tourism.  Two decentralised officials left Killarney at 7 a.m. to get here to assist the Minister to provide answers to Deputy Mitchell&rsquo;s questions.  The train to Mallow broke down, then the second train broke down.  They were on mobile telephones and because of the lack of capacity they could not be heard in Dublin.  It is the tale of the disappeared.  They never arrived to provide solace and comfort to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism who was here trying to answer pertinent questions from Deputy Mitchell last week.</P>

	<P>That is what happens when one has an unplanned decentralised system.  If Departments were decentralised all over the country when the banking crisis erupted, there would have been chaos.  A number of years ago we pointed out how decentralisation should have been implemented.  Where decentralisation was planned in Donegal, Tullamore and other places around the country it has worked very well.  Parking it in limbo until 2011 is obviously a political ploy to reactivate it at some stage.</P>
        <P>The simple measure of the Government&rsquo;s performance yesterday is that we are demonstrably in a far worse position than any of our European neighbours.  No country has been immune to the banking crisis, but when the international financial tsunami hit they were in a far better position to withstand it.  No country has been as apathetic, lazy or smug in its response to this crisis.  We saw what happened in Spain.  In our recession, into which the Taoiseach has led us, yesterday&rsquo;s budget offered no light at the end of the tunnel.  People know they are poorer now.  They are worse off in that they will have to pay more.  In terms of taking the major decisions, the Government funked this.  In the Government&rsquo;s war on the middle classes an ordinary PAYE worker taking home &euro;50,000 loses &euro;1,000 of his or her income directly and then faces a series of extra costs and stealth charges, draining away that income, if he or she is lucky enough to be able to keep his or her job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Taoiseach rightly pointed out, the people have endless courage and an unequalled capacity for work, but this morning they will read that the consequences of this budget will be a serious lowering of their standard of living.  Many of them will be tipped into poverty.  Nothing corrodes a family like poverty which is brought about by circumstances it cannot control.  The new income levies are precisely that.  They are crude in design and impact.  In the past when we had major problems we levied the banks.  Now that the banks have caused us enormous problems the Government has not levied them but slapped a levy on the mortgaged<?oasys _jy ?>poor.</P><Col N="748"/>
        <P>I note the Minister for Finance yesterday judiciously leaked the fact the Government intends to reduce wages in the banking sector, as a diversion to what is happening today.  The spin machine is in full flight, particularly in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  We were told last July there would be no cutbacks in education, health or social welfare and that the poor and vulnerable would be protected.  We know what the spin is but the reality is very different.</P>
        <P>Pensioners who are to get an extra euro per day will see the value of that increase go down the tubes when their medical card is means tested.  The Government does not seem to appreciate the mentality of elderly people who were awarded a medical card by the State.  The Taoiseach has said that some of them will receive a &euro;400 grant towards their medical expenses but the vast majority of such people have respiratory illnesses and will not use the &euro;400 grant because they are afraid to go to the doctor in the first place.  They will end up in hospital beds, which would not happen had they gone to their doctor in the first place.</P>
        <P>The Government set up a system to award medical cards to all those over 70 and the recipients were comfortable with that.  Had the Government said in the beginning that it intended to give medical cards to those over 70, subject to a particularly flexible means test, those who are well off and over 70 would have accepted that.  Instead, the Government introduced a universal scheme, which those over 70 accepted and with which they were very comfortable.  Many elderly people will not use a GP-visit card or the &euro;400 grant because they are afraid to go to the doctor in the first place.  They will get so ill that they will end up in hospital and on trolleys, as the Minister for Health and Children knows only too well.  The Government&rsquo;s actions in respect of these medical cards is deplorable and despicable.</P>
        <P>This budget is all about taking back from diligent people who carry no responsibility for the disaster that this Government has failed to avert.  There are cutbacks in medical care provision and increases in accident and emergency charges.  The Taoiseach clarified the position this morning regarding nursing homes, raised by Deputy Michael Noonan yesterday, although we do not yet know the final shape of the fair deal legislation..</P>
        <P>This nation faces a cut in direct front line services in education and increases in class sizes.  Does anyone remember the promises made by the former Ministers for Education and Science, Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin and Noel Dempsey?  It is a case of give a thing, take it back.</P>
        <P>For families, this budget is a double-edged sword.  The pain starts here and now but the real suffering will begin in six months&rsquo; time.  If the Department of Finance has got its figures wrong, in terms of the international projections, then God help Ireland next year.  The Government has fleeced us through taxes on petrol, travel, capital gains and so forth, with the prospect of more to come for every citizen next year.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance got all its figures wrong in recent years.  It got all the figures wrong for this year and yet it can predict what the international situation will be next year and the year after.  Fianna F&aacute;il in Government has suddenly found the crystal ball and the path back to budgetary efficiency, a strong economy and competitiveness.  It will achieve these by taxing every person to pay for its wanton mistakes and its fast and reckless use of taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>

I urge the Government to talk to shop owners and small business people.  They are spending half a day a <Col N="749"/>week filling in forms for the Government and now they will have to do more.  The employer of the 16 year old who works for a few hours on a Saturday in a sweet shop or a coffee shop will now have to fill in more forms for the Government to pay the 1% income levy.

	<P>The banking sector which in many ways was responsible for so much angst is now in a bizarre relationship with the Government.  We do not yet know the extent of the bad debt or rolled up interest in that sector.  I hope that when the Government publishes its scheme tomorrow, all of that detail will be made available so that we will know to what we are signing up.  </P>
        <P>This Government continues to take money out of the economy rather than getting better value for the money it spends.  It commits us to massive borrowing each and every day, with more to follow next year, up to &euro;13.5 billion.  It is horrifyingly over-optimistic for next year.  This budget is disastrous.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The so-called plans that were set out yesterday are not plans.  There was no detail or forecast and no clear method for reforming the public sector spelled out.  Some of the best people I have met in my life work in the public sector.  The Government will make the taxpayer pay for many of them to become redundant because it says they should not have been employed in the first place.  The former Minister for Finance, former Deputy Charlie McCreevy, increased current spending and the Government hired 30,000 more public servants, most of them in administration.  The Government now tells the taxpayer that it plans to get rid of those staff because they should not have been employed in the first place but it provides no detail as to how this will be achieved.  This process will drift and drift, as the Taoiseach knows.</P>
        <P>The reality is that for an easy political ride, this Government mortgaged the country to the builders, developers and speculators.  It created a new elite, which is now demanding that the taxpayer bails it out.  The Minister for Finance has a name for this.  It is called patriotism.  The new definition of Fianna F&aacute;il patriotism is war on the middle classes and businesses and a failure to protect the vulnerable.  This is a disastrous budget, for which the Government will pay the price.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The net effect of yesterday&rsquo;s statement by the Minister for Finance to the House, in terms of the education budget, is that children will pay the price for Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s incompetence over the past five years.  The children in primary and post-primary schools must pay the price for the Government&rsquo;s incompetence, waste and wanton disregard for financial stability.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach lectured the House this morning about honesty in this debate.  Let us have that honesty from the other side of the House.  When the Minister for Finance gave his statement to the House yesterday, he did not refer to cutbacks in education.  Yet, within a matter of two hours, the Minister for Education and Science, who appears to have done a runner today and is not about the place at all, produced a list of cutbacks which runs to 32 in total.  There are 32 cutbacks in the Education and Science Vote planned for 2009 but the Minister for Finance in the House did not refer to this yesterday.  If we are to take patronising lectures about honesty in this debate, let us put all the information out there and stop spinning, as this Government has done for the past 11 years or so.  Let us call it as it is &mdash; we are asking children to pay the price for the Government&rsquo;s incompetence.  That is the reality that faces teachers, parents and students today.</P><Col N="750"/>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The education budget here has historically been smaller than education budgets in other European countries because the religious orders provided free education for many years, although that has now changed.  We spend approximately 4.6% of our GDP on education, which is the second lowest in the European Union.  Another problem is that we have a very high number of students in the age cohort for formal, full-time education.  We do not spend enough on education and we spread the money so thinly, throughout the sectors, as to make no real difference.  The situation will get much more difficult next year throughout all sectors of education.  I want to make one proposal to the Minister for Education and Science when he finally manages to get to his seat today and if he does speak in public on this issue.  He needs to publish a revised programme for Government in the education area and stop this wish list and phantom list currently in place to which the Government has allegedly signed up.</P>
        <P>I also want to hear from the Green Party.  When the deal was done last year, Deputy Trevor Sargent was a bit like Neville Chamberlain with &ldquo;peace in our time&rdquo; when he promised &euro;350 million extra in services each year for the next five years.  He also promised a reduction in class size and I will come to that.  The Green Party has a responsibility to come to the plinth and tell us exactly how it has all gone so wrong.  Why has it lost the debate within Government when it comes to the education vote?  I never thought I would state this, but even at this stage Deputy Mary Hanafin should return &mdash; all is forgiven &mdash; as the situation has deteriorated rapidly since her demotion to the Department of Social and Family Affairs only a matter of months ago.</P>
        <P>With regard to class size, prior to the general election, 20,000 parents were brought to public halls throughout the country.  I call on the same organisation which brought those 20,000 parents into the public domain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget is full of taxes, charges and levies targeted at middle Ireland, while nothing has been done to ask the high rollers to pay their fair share.  This is a budget airline budget.  The speech was full of high-minded waffle about patriotic action, but when one looks at the small print, one sees the taxes and charges.  My colleague, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, has begun to count them and has reached 30.  The treacherous 30 cuts.  This is where the &euro;1 fare suddenly becomes &euro;100.  However, those in first class will not be affected.</P>
        <P>This budget is not fair, it is mean.  It does not protect the less well off, it attacks them.  It gives the meanest possible increase in social welfare, cuts entitlements, and takes medical cards from elderly people.  People who worked hard all their lives and paid taxes hand over fist have had the rug pulled from under them by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It does nothing to create jobs, in fact it will destroy jobs and it makes absolutely clear that the Government has learned nothing from its mistakes, but remains wedded to the same old failed developer-led economy.</P>
        <P>Of course, to learn from its mistakes, the Government would have to admit it made any.  That it refuses to do.  It took it three months to admit there was any economic problem in the first place and now it claims this whole mess is someone else&rsquo;s fault.  Given the turmoil in international financial markets, it is easy for the Government to deflect blame elsewhere.  However, if it is all to do with international problems, why is Ireland the first eurozone economy to enter into recession?  If it is the fault of the international economy, why is the downturn in the Irish public finances greater than in any other country?  If this is all the fault of someone else, why are we seeing the fastest ever rise in the live register, long before the international credit crunch?</P><Col N="753"/>
        <P>The truth is that this is a homegrown domestic recession brought on by failed economic management by a Government which coasted in good times and is bewildered in the new economic circumstances.  When it came to office, the Government was handed an economy in excellent condition in the middle of an export boom.  From 2001, however, the export boom faded to be replaced by an economy driven by a property bubble.</P>
        <P>I cannot recall the number of times I and my Labour Party colleagues called on the Government to tackle rising house prices.  Again and again we raised it but the Government refused to act.  Anyone who dared question the boom was denounced.  When people raised legitimate questions about the economy&rsquo;s direction, particularly about the use of tax breaks to feather-bed property developers, they were denounced by the former Minister for Finance and now EU Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, as left-wing pinkos and they advised the country to party on.  Not to be outdone, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, around the same time, denounced anyone who questioned his Government&rsquo;s economic strategy as a creeping Jesus.  As recently as July 2007, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in an address to the ICTU conference in Bundoran, said he did not know why people who engaged in cribbing and moaning about the economy did not commit suicide.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il did nothing to limit the growth in house prices.  It refused to curtail speculation, to implement the Kenny report, which would have controlled the price of building lands and it remained addicted to property-based tax incentives.  That is why we have a recession and why people on low and middle-incomes are being asked to pick up the tab.</P>
        <P>There is a bailout for the banks and property speculators.  There is none, however, for a young couple who took out one of those 100% mortgages now faced with higher mortgage repayments, job insecurity and being hit with a series of further tax hikes.</P>
        <P>The only place a person in those circumstances can go for help and advice when the banks and building societies are descending on them to repay the mortgage is the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  It is interesting it is one of the State agencies to be emasculated under the guise of rationalisation.  MABS will be amalgamated with the Citizens Information Board instead of being allowed to continue providing valuable, professional and independent services to people in money trouble.</P>
        <P>It is also remarkable the Combat Poverty Agency will be hauled back into the social inclusion unit in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the unit which gave this budget a clear bill of health yesterday.  This is a case of the watchdog being withdrawn to the kennels.  The Government does not want any independent voice examining how it is dealing with the plight of poor people.</P>
        <P>When economies get into trouble, there is always a hunger for fiscal austerity.  No matter where the recession starts, the first course of action is always to cut public services.  The cry goes up, &ldquo;Let there be pain&rdquo;.   Pain for whom?  It will not be the stockbrokers or the bankers but the patients on trolleys in Drogheda and every other accident and emergency department.  We are told the economy needs tough medicine and people are advised to take it.  People on an accident and emergency trolley would happily take their medicine if they could only get seen by a doctor.  We are told it is time for tough decisions, but tough for whom?  It will be tough for people losing their jobs and having their entitlements cut.  They are the people who will have it tough.</P>
        <P>Ministers give lectures on the need to be responsible.  The cost of their failures will fall on the hard-working women and men, already experts on responsibility because they shoulder it every day.  The people who work hard, nurture others, pay for everything and play by the rules are the ones who will carry the responsibility in this budget.</P><Col N="754"/>
        <P>A family on a modest income will easily pay &euro;2,000 more in tax as a result of this budget.  A family on &euro;60,000 will pay &euro;734 extra in tax.  A family with a child going to college will pay &euro;600 more in fees.  The Government seems not to know that the transition year exists and means many children do the leaving certificate at 18 yet child benefit for them has been abolished.  If a family has a five year old, child care payment will be cut by &euro;550.  A family with medical expenses of any kind &mdash; it is not unusual for families to pay &euro;2,000 or more in medical costs for someone who needs special care &mdash; will have its tax refund cut in half.</P>
        <P>A family that must drive to work will pay &euro;200 to park the car at work or pay &euro;400 to use the park-and-ride facility at the train station.  We still have to hear how this new car parking tax will be applied.  Will this involve everyone who has a car parking space?</P>

	<P>Will this apply to those who have temporary use of facilities and drive to work some days but not on others?  Will they have to pay the full amount?  This is an example of finding every possible means to inflict additional taxes on working people.</P>
        <P>These same families will pay more in so-called voluntary contributions in schools because school funding has been frozen while school expenses have rocketed.  They will pay more for petrol to go to work.  They will pay more to visit an accident and emergency department if, by some chance, they happen to have an accident or an emergency and cannot pop into the GP on the way.  They will pay 0.5% more on VAT on everything else they spend.</P>
        <P>As they munch on their breakfast rolls this morning, the people in the commuter belt who voted Fianna F&aacute;il back into office in large numbers have been betrayed.  They will carry the can.  Perhaps the best expression of the Government&rsquo;s philosophy came, not from any Minister but from its devoted friend and champion, the chairman of Anglo-Irish Bank.  Safely protected from the consequences of his failures by the Government guarantee and having pocketed the largest welfare cheque ever written, he was prominent in his call for pain.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In Mr. Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s world, which is also the world of Fianna F&aacute;il, the Progressive Democrats and the Green Party, children and old people come last in the budget.  Class sizes are getting larger.  Cuts are being implemented for language support teachers, the early school leavers programme, the school books scheme, grants for youth services, while in-service development and school transport charges are being increased.  After all the years of prosperity, we still do not have a preschool education programme and the early years subsidy has been cut.</P>
        <P>Mr. Fitzpatrick must be one happy banker this morning with what has happened to the old.  Pensions will increase by a mere &euro;7 while medical cards have been removed from the over 70s.  Rather than confront the vested interests in the medical profession, which made the scheme so <Col N="755"/>expensive, the Government has targeted the over 70s.  This move will cause untold distress and anxiety for older people.</P>
        <P>As I have repeatedly said, the problem in the public finances has been caused by the recession, not the other way around.  What we needed, therefore, was a budget that would stimulate economic activity and get people back to work.  Instead, we got the opposite.  This is a deflationary budget, which will suck money out of the economy and reduce purchasing power.  The knock-on effect will result in job losses.</P>
        <P>This is just year one of a three-year strategy to cut the deficit by 5% of GDP.  That is a severe fiscal contraction by any standards.  Corrective action is necessary, but we are in the middle of an unprecedented banking crisis, which has already led to a major tightening of credit conditions in the economy.  At the same time, we are facing a major international recession and downturn in international trade, which will limit exports as a source of demand.  For the Government to further curtail demand will cost jobs.</P>
        <P>One cannot compare Ireland now to the country it was in the 1980s and say that fiscal contraction is good.  In the 1980s, Ireland had its own currency, whereas it is now part of the euro zone.  That fact fundamentally changes the equation for budgetary policy.  Our Government deficit will not affect interest rates or inflation.  Given our low debt-income ratio, the macro-economic risks of Government deficits are limited.  That is not to say that we can run large deficits indefinitely.  I am not suggesting that, or that difficult decisions are not required, but taking 5% of GDP out of the economy over three years is very risky indeed.  What is the objective?  To get back to a position, by 2011, where we will once again be funding capital spending out of current income, at the expense of jobs?</P>
        <P>This is not the time to destroy jobs, it is the time to create them, but where are the initiatives in this budget to create jobs?  What is being done to find alternative employment for people who are losing their jobs?  Where is the major programme of re-skilling and retraining that is needed for those 80,000 people who have joined the dole queues in the past year?</P>
        <P>The expert group on future skills needs says that at least 500,000 people must improve their qualification levels over the next decade.  Why not start now with those who are losing their jobs?  Thousands of people are losing their jobs in the house building sector.  They could have been put to work building schools, social housing, urban regeneration schemes or house insulation, but what did we get?  The Exchequer allocation for school buildings is being cut and the insulation scheme amounts to &euro;20 for each house that needs retro-fitting.  Can nobody in the Government effectively champion the need for energy conservation?  Instead of a major retraining programme being launched, the back-to-education initiative is being cut.</P>
        <P>Two weeks ago, this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government wrote the biggest welfare cheque in the history of the State.  Not a social welfare cheque, but a society welfare cheque.  It was worth tens of billions of euro and was made payable to some of the richest people in our country &mdash; the bankers.  We were told it was necessary because those same bankers lent out untold fortunes to property developers, the friends of Fianna F&aacute;il.  They are the people who pay for expensive advertising campaigns which tell voters that only Fianna F&aacute;il can manage the economy.</P>
        <P>The Government has been spinning hard that this budget will protect the vulnerable at the expense of the better off, but it will do nothing of the sort.  Social welfare incomes have been increased by the bare minimum of 3%, in a year when the price of bread is up 17%, flour by 34%, milk by 25% and bottled gas by 15%.  That is why the Society of St. Vincent de Paul called for a &euro;15-per week increase in welfare rates.  Instead, however, they got a pathetic &euro;6.50.  If somebody on social welfare is also on a rent allowance, &euro;5 of that &euro;6.50 will be clawed back by an increase in the minimum contribution that social welfare recipients on rent allowance are required to make to their rent payment.</P><Col N="756"/>
        <P>Increases in the fuel allowance are paltry and progress on all other social welfare areas has been stalled.  The living alone allowance, a particular concern of Age Action, has been left untouched.  A set of mean-spirited, unfair, harsh and unwarranted restrictions has been placed on people who have just lost their jobs and have recently signed on.  These are the people who had a contract with the Government; they paid their PRSI and never expected to have to collect benefits, but now their entitlement to claim benefit has been severely restricted.</P>
        <P>We were told that top earners would pay most, but that is simply not so.  In fact, the budget booklet shows that a couple on &euro;120,000 will pay the same, in percentage terms, as a person on &euro;60,000.  The low paid are now effectively in the tax net, wiping out the additional increase they were supposed to receive under the social partnership agreement.</P>
        <P>The spin from the Government this morning was that Labour had introduced the same type of levy in 1993.  We did so, but made sure to exempt people earning less that &pound;170 per week, which is the equivalent of &euro;416 today.  Moreover, anyone on a medical card was exempt from the levy.</P>
        <P>I will quote from the budget speech of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  He may not have been socialist himself, but at that time he was surrounded by a few socialists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Where was Deputy Gilmore then?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The then Minister for Finance said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The new levy will be at a rate of 1%, but with an income exemption in order to protect the lower paid.  In the case of the self-employed, the exemption will apply where income for the year is not greater than &pound;9,000.  In the case of employees, the levy will not be payable in any week where the income is not greater than &pound;173.  In setting the income threshold at this level, rather than at the general tax exemption limits, the potential full-year yield for the levy is diminished by some &pound;20 million.  However, in doing so, I have ensured that a further 217,000 taxpayers will not be affected by the levy, over and above the 290,000 who are exempted from income tax.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If that same principle was applied today, it would mean that somebody on an income of approximately &euro;30,000 a year would be exempt from the levy that was introduced here yesterday, which is of course a new form of taxation.</P>
        <P>Once again, however, the big tax breaks and tax avoidance measures have been left untouched.  Tax relief on mortgage interest for landlords remains at a cost of &euro;572 million.  Tax relief for super-private clinics, so favoured by the Minister for Health and Children, remains at a cost of  &euro;1 billion.  The loophole that allows developers to avoid stamp duty on commercial property is not touched.  The great tax&ndash;break for the rich in small, self-administered pension schemes remains in place.</P>
        <P>We still have the bank bail-out, including, without any explanation, dated subordinated debt.  Who holds that debt and why are they covered by the bank bail-out scheme and guarantee when no other European country has covered it?  Last weekend, the Paris communiqu&eacute; explicitly referred only to the coverage and protection of senior debt.</P>
        <P>We still do not know what the great bail-out will bring to the Exchequer or what conditionality will apply.  On Monday, four of the most senior bankers in the United Kingdom went to Downing street with jobs and left sacked.  The only person who was sacked here last Monday was the unfortunate manager of the Galway hurling team.</P><Col N="757"/>
        <P>It is not just Ireland&rsquo;s poor who will suffer.  Once again, as a country, we are reneging on our commitment to the world&rsquo;s poor by cutting overseas development aid.  When the economy is growing, we are told that ODA cannot keep up.  When the economy is not growing, we are told we cannot afford to keep our promise.  If that is patriotism, then it is a pretty sad form of it.</P>
        <P>Government Ministers are saying that cuts will not affect health, education or social welfare, but that is patently untrue.  Hospital budgets are being squeezed, there is a long list of miserable cuts in education and there are severe restrictions in entitlement to social insurance.  Making the poor pay is not just unfair, it is also unwise.</P>
        <P>If one wants to take a lesson from the history of Irish social partnership, it is this: we have done best as a nation when we combined a strategy for economic growth with a determination to protect the vulnerable and share gains.  However imperfect, social partnership was based on that formula.  It did not go as far as many of us would have wished, but it was a powerful dynamic nonetheless.</P>
        <P>If one looked across Europe after the oil shocks of the 1970s, it was the countries which were able to share the cost of economic downturn fairly that emerged most strongly.  This budget has no strategy for growth, and contains no ethic of social solidarity.  It contains a series of spending cuts, some stupid and some just simply cruel.</P>
        <P>This is a budget from an era that is past.  In recent weeks, the failings of neo-liberalism and the Washington consensus have been shown up in glorious technicolour.  For years, those who have argued for equality and solidarity in our society have been confronted by a rigid right-wing orthodoxy.  The simple and simplistic view of history was that there was no more left and right, there was only right; that regulation should be light, or better avoided altogether; that the market was the only system that could efficiently deliver any economic or social need; that financial markets were the ultimate expression of market efficiency; that greed was good; that a small, and ever shrinking state was the only road map for future prosperity; that European civilisation, with its regulated market and strong social spending was a fossil from another era; and that global capitalism was incompatible with social solidarity and inequality.</P>
        <P>It turns out that the conservative, monetarist orthodoxy is spectacularly wrong.  Those assumptions have been turned on their head.  Deregulation, it turns out, can be a recipe for risky, and sometimes down-right dishonest practices which can put jobs, business and homes at risk.  Markets, particularly financial markets, are often irrational, and unregulated financial markets can bring the world to the brink of economic meltdown.  Greed, in the form of a hedge fund, can bring down a bank and destroy jobs in the real economy.  Government, it turns out, has a role to play after all.  If the neo-liberals had their way, there would not have been enough Government left to organise the bailout.  The European social model, though requiring reform, provides a basis for stable sustainable growth, coupled with equality.</P>
        <P>For years, when the left argued that executive pay was grossly out of control, we were scoffed at.  One could not possibly restrict the pay of these masters of the Universe or the world would come crashing down around our ears.  Guess what, the world very nearly came crashing down around our ears, and it may not be over yet.</P>
        <P>Where now are all those people who told us that inequality was a good thing, that it provided the right incentives in the economy?  Inequality is at the heart of the sub-prime crisis that gave rise to the economic difficulties in the first place.  When the investment bankers ran out of developing countries to which to lend money, they found a Third World country in the heart of the world&rsquo;s greatest economic power, in the United States.  Working-class America had seen its income stagnate since the 1980s of Reagan, and they were the ideal target for sub-prime lending.  The international economic crisis had its roots in income inequality.</P><Col N="758"/>
        <P>Political economy is back.  Equality is not an optional extra or a drain on growth.  It is a basic requirement of a civilised society and of economic progress.  The decisions made in this budget matter to real people in the here and now.  In the run-up to this budget, there has been a clamour for hair-shirts, so long as someone else wears them.  The Government, it is argued, must manage its affairs like a family or a business, and balance its budget.  That, too, was the philosophy that informed Government responses to the Great Depression of the 1930s.  It was that same conservative view that pushed the world into depression &mdash; bail out the bankers, and hammer those who pay their taxes and play by the rules.</P>
        <P>On Sunday last, the Minister for Finance quoted President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, when he said that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.  Like all quotations used out of context, it can be used to justify anything but what the author had originally intended.  It is worth me finishing by reminding the House of some of the rest of that same speech, FDR&rsquo;s inaugural.  It is worth remembering because it shows how the struggle for decency is always with us.  President Roosevelt stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">. . . let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself &mdash; nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">. . . Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply.  Primarily this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind&rsquo;s goods have failed, through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">. . . Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected in the hearts and minds of men.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">. . . They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers.  They have no vision, and where there is no vision the people perish.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilisation.  We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths.  The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Let me repeat:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I repeat that sentence because it underlines the approach the Labour Party in Ireland is taking to our present economic circumstances, just as it underlines the approach being taken by FDR&rsquo;s successor, Senator Obama across the Atlantic.</P>
        <P el="5">President Roosevelt further stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Our greatest primary task is to put people to work.  This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. . . .</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There was no New Deal in this budget.  There was no attempt to create jobs.  Instead, there was an attack on old people, on poor people, and a vicious assault on working and middle income families.</P>
        <P>I challenge the Government to put this budget to the test of the people.  There is a vacancy in this House.  There is a by-election due in the constituency of Dublin South.  I challenge the Government to move the writ for that by-election to hold it now so that at least the people of <Col N="759"/>that constituency can give their verdict on what the Government is doing and on the lies the Government told the people just over 12 months ago when they were re-elected to office.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on Budget 2009, and to outline, in particular, how the transport agenda is being advanced by this budget and how the money allocated to the Department of Transport will be spent in 2009.</P>
        <P>In general terms, the gross expenditure provision for the Department in 2009 is &euro;3.6 billion, that is, &euro;2.8 billion for capital projects and &euro;725 million for current spending.</P>
        <P>The total Exchequer provision for Transport 21 in 2009 is almost &euro;2.4 billion.  This year we will allocate: &euro;1.27 billion for public transport, &euro;2.1 billion on roads, &euro;35 million for the aviation sector and regional airports, and &euro;40 million on road safety.  Those are the major expenditure headings of the Department.  In addition, some &euro;607 million will be spent on improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads around the country.</P>
        <P>I make it clear that provisions have been made to continue work on the critical public transport projects of metro north and the DART interconnector.  Despite our more constrained economic circumstances we cannot and will not stop planning and providing future public transport solutions.  In this budget, the advanced works plus the planning for metro north and for the DART interconnector continue.</P>
        <P>When we launched Transport 21 in 2005 we detailed an ambitious investment programme in our transport infrastructure.  The individual projects listed under Transport 21 were excellent projects in 2005.  They are still excellent projects today and they will be excellent projects in a few years from now.  There is no question of cancelling any of the projects despite the more constrained economic circumstances in which we find ourselves today.  However, as our economy has not grown this year in line with our expectations, or indeed anything like it, some of the projects, mainly in the roads area, will have to be rolled out at a slower pace than we had originally intended.  That is not ideal and not what we wished.  However, it is inevitable in the current difficult economic environment.</P>
        <P>In these more difficult times it is important to look at how far we have come in recent years.  When we took office in 1997 the total capital provision for national roads and public transport, the equivalent to Transport 21, was &euro;306 million, as opposed to the &euro;2.5 billion now.  Just &euro;12 million was being spent by the Exchequer on public transport investment, whereas today we are spending just over &euro;900 million.</P>
        <P>That money has been well spent.  A great deal has been achieved in the intervening period.  We are on track to complete the five major inter-urban motorways by the end of 2010.  This involves the construction of almost 750 km of new road, approximately 390 km of which is already open to traffic and the remaining 360 km is at construction.  One tangible example of the progress we have made is that it is now possible to travel on continuous motorway from Dundalk to Portlaoise.  We have revitalised the railways and rescued them from a slow decline over previous decades.  Under the railway safety programme we have renewed the physical infrastructure and strengthened the management of safety.  We now have one of the youngest inter-city rail fleets in Europe.  We also have one of the fastest growing rail facilities in Europe.  As services have improved, the public has responded and passenger numbers have grown substantially.  Despite the economic downturn, those figures are remaining static at present.  There has been no loss to the railways.</P>
        <P>There has been major investment in the Dublin suburban rail network.  The capacity of the DART system has almost doubled, the original rolling stock has been refurbished, station <Col N="760"/>platforms have been lengthened and much of the infrastructure has been renewed.  There has also been a huge investment in new outer suburban rail stock and an expansion in services.  The Luas network has proven exceptionally popular with the travelling public and now carries over 28 million passengers each year.</P>
        <P>We have made a large investment in bus services.  The fleet has been renewed and Dublin Bus capacity has expanded by over a quarter.</P>

	<P>The Labour Party should accept that we should not waste public expenditure in good or bad times.</P>
        <P>We have made huge strides on improving the accessibility of our public transport system for persons with disabilities.  Some 80% of the Dublin Bus fleet will be accessible by the end of this year and approximately one third of bus stops in the greater Dublin area will have been upgraded by then.  All of the city bus fleet in the regional cities is 100% low floor and accessible for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>Despite the economic downturn, it is clear that 2009 will be another huge year for transport projects.  My aim is to deliver increased public transport passenger capacity.  I will ensure that project planning continues to ensure that sufficient projects are ready to start as soon as funding becomes available.</P>

	<P>The Deputy should listen until I conclude my contribution.  I will put him right on a number of matters.</P>
        <P>I have endeavoured to continue the planning for all the public transport projects in Transport 21 and bring them to tender stage.  None of them that was due to start next year is being postponed.  The projects will continue to be planned and designed, and public consultation will continue to take place.  They will be brought to tender stage as quickly as possible.  I wish to ensure that the five major inter-urban routes are on target for completion by 2010.  The &euro;1.27 billion provision this year for public transport will maintain the momentum of our investment programme to date.</P>
        <P>In addition, a number of important projects in public transport will be completed next year.  Construction of the Luas extension from Connolly Station to Docklands will finish towards the <Col N="761"/>end of the year.  Phase one of the western rail corridor from Ennis to Athenry will be completed, allowing for the introduction of an inter-city service from Limerick to Galway and a commuter service from Athenry to Galway and the Cork-Midleton line will reopen, leading to a major extension of commuter rail services in Cork.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said &ldquo;allowing for the introduction of an inter-city service from Limerick to Galway&rdquo;.  With regard to the service from Athenry to Galway, will that be by rail sometime in the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a commuter service from Athenry to Galway.  It is inter-city at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that by bus?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is rail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the route to Athenry be completed next year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it bus from there to Galway?  What does that mean?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It will allow for commuter rail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>However, there is no timescale for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>What we are doing in phase one of the western rail corridor will allow for a commuter service from Athenry to Galway from next year, once it is completed.  The western rail corridor is obviously for inter-city services but it will also try to enhance commuter services, such as the existing Ennis-Limerick commuter service.</P>
        <P>Investment in bus priority in Dublin and the regional cities will be increased in 2009.  I have asked the Dublin local authorities to give particular attention to the elimination of pinch points on the bus network.  There are approximately 43 pinch points on the quality bus corridors in Dublin.  These have been mapped at my request and a plan is in place to remove them within a two year period.  The one thing on which Deputy Broughan and I agree is that efficient and effective bus services will be needed in the short and medium term as work continues on the metro.  I am anxious to secure quality bus corridors that actually work and that make it attractive for people to use bus services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister needs the buses to run on them.  He needs 300 buses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are sufficient buses to run the services we have at present.  In fact, the indications are that they could be run a good deal more efficiently so we could get more bang for our buck.  It is not a question, as we have so often been accused of doing by the Opposition, of throwing money, or in this case buses, at the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the frequency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of things must be done including, which I hope the Deputy will support, changed work practices and using the buses we have at present to their full potential.  I look forward to the Deputy&rsquo;s support as we move on that in the next six to 12 months.</P><Col N="762"/>
        <P>Construction of phase one of the Navan rail line and the Citywest Luas extension will get underway shortly, despite the doom and gloom preached in the House last night by Deputy Burton.  In 2009 we will continue to work on the Luas extension from Sandyford to Cherrywood; the four-tracking of the Kildare rail line from Cherry Orchard to Hazelhatch, allowing the trebling of passenger capacity on that corridor; the roll-out of the 183 new intercity railcars; and the city centre resignalling project.  The latter is vital to the provision of adequate services within the greater Dublin area.  Expenditure will continue on a number of ongoing programmes, including the railway safety and accessibility programmes.</P>
        <P>Increasing public transport capacity is one of my key priorities.  Metro north and the DART interconnector are critical components of the strategy, set out in Transport 21, to transform the public transport system in the greater Dublin area.  They will also provide for a great increase in public transport capacity.  Metro north is expected to carry 34 million passengers per annum when it opens and will be able to carry more than 200 million passengers per year in the longer term as development occurs along the route.  The interconnector will remove a major bottleneck in the Dublin rail system.  When it is completed it will facilitate trebling of the passenger capacity of the suburban rail network to more than 100 million passengers per annum.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency, which is responsible for the project, applied last month to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a railway order for metro north.  The application clearly sets out the route alignment, underground and surface sections and station locations.  The public private partnership tenders are due to be submitted to the Railway Procurement Agency in early February.  Once the procurement and the statutory approval processes are complete, the Government will take a final decision on the project, based on a capital appraisal.  This is a long-standing requirement for all very large projects under Transport 21.  Once the railway order is in force, the Railway Procurement Agency will be in a position to commence enabling works for the public private partnership project, such as the relocation of utilities.  The 2009 Estimates include substantial funding provision for these works.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>How much?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The total is in the Book of Estimates.  I will obtain it for the Deputy and let him know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not state the figure specifically?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of enabling works must take place, including the purchase of land.  Some of these works are under way.  The design cost must continue to be considered.</P>
        <P>There was much speculation on whether metro north was to proceed.  Deputy Broughan and I had discussions on it in the House and I acknowledged his acceptance of my advice not to raise issues about whether it would go ahead.  I thank him for this.  However, I have heard much ignorant comment about metro north and questions as to why we do not acquire buses.  To do what we want with metro north, that is, to move approximately 20,000 passengers in each direction during peak travel times, we would have to invest in approximately 400 to 500 buses.  There would not be sufficient road space to do so.  If one were to opt for a Luas solution, as some are advocating, the maximum number of passengers one could accommodate would be approximately 8,000 per hour at peak time.  Given that the population is to grow to approximately 500,000 to 600,000 by 2015-16, a Luas or totally bus-based system of public transport in the north County Dublin area is a nonsensical proposition.</P><Col N="763"/>
        <P>If we could do nothing but carry out the metro north and interconnector projects over the next four or five years, we would lay the foundation for a really good public transport system.  The investment involved in metro north should not be considered in light of the 30-year period during which we will pay for it under the public private partnership but in light of the fact that the system will serve the needs of the people for 50 or 100 years.  This is why I am so committed to making progress.</P>
        <P>Planning for the DART interconnector is also continuing and good progress is being made.  I have made it clear to CIE that I want to see this progress maintained and, where possible, accelerated.  In deference to people in business, particularly in the city centre, I want to minimise the period of disruption and work on both projects together.  Deputy Broughan and other Members have raised this with me in the House.  CIE is aware of the issue and is making a considerable effort to address it.  There are certain areas in which works must be carried out sequentially but others in which they can be carried out simultaneously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The railway order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The target is to be ready to submit a railway order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la towards the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>The interconnector project only facilitates the expansion of the capacity of the suburban rail network.  Other measures are required to deliver that capacity, most particularly the electrification of the wider suburban network and the purchase of new electric rolling stock.  Planning for these projects is ongoing.  Electrification must be completed before the interconnector is in place and we are committed to achieving this.  The 2009 Estimates include a substantial provision for the continuing planning work needed for the railway order application and for the commencement of electrification work.</P>
        <P>Buses are another key component of my strategy to increase capacity.  I ordered a cost and efficiency review of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  When that study has been completed and I have considered its findings, I will decide on future bus investment strategy.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the commitment to the many public transport projects to which I have referred that there is now a significant shift to more sustainable transport in the Government&rsquo;s national development plan.  This should not come as a surprise to anyone because, when I launched a public consultation document earlier this year, I outlined the Government&rsquo;s vision of having a sustainable transport system by 2020.  I also outlined that, if we continue as we are, travel trends in Ireland will be on a totally unsustainable trajectory.</P>
        <P>One could argue that the economic down-turn will solve the transport problem on the grounds that less activity will lead to lower population growth, but that is a short-sighted way of looking at the matter.  Transport planning must be carried out over the medium to long term and it is both hopelessly pessimistic and unwise to plan for the future based entirely on the immediate economic difficulties.  This is probably the trap we all fell into in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.</P>
        <P>In carrying out the public consultation process on the sustainable travel and transport action plan, I was surprised by the extent of the engagement.  Nearly 500 thoughtful submissions were received, a much higher response rate than normal, and the issues raised in the consultation document resonated well with the public.  People are concerned about the harmful effects of motorised traffic, they recognise that efficient movement of goods is vital for our economy and they are aware that how they travel in the future is one of the most important influences in the quality of their lives.</P><Col N="764"/>
        <P>I have consistently promised to publish the sustainable travel and transport action plan this year to set out a new policy framework for transport to meet the Government&rsquo;s vision.  In setting out the many transport investment projects being delivered in this budget, I reaffirm the priority I and my colleagues attach to getting the new policy framework in place.  I intend to bring the draft plan and a proposed national cycle policy before the Government in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In practical terms, I intend safeguarding the budgets for sustainable travel initiatives in the Vote of my Department.  I am maintaining the momentum of the green schools travel initiative, which will target 260,000 school children by 2012 and which will, I hope, result in many of them switching to walking or cycling to get to school.  In addition, we have secured &euro;10 million for carbon reduction measures in 2009 related directly to transport.  In addition to these sustainable transport initiatives, we have also made provision in this year&rsquo;s budget for the new Marlborough Street public transport bridge, which will facilitate the metro works.</P>
        <P>Virtually all the national road Exchequer provision for 2009 is already contractually committed to the delivery of the projects on the major inter-urban routes.  The NRA expects that six major projects, totalling 143 km of dual carriageway road, will open to traffic between now and the end of 2009.  These are as follows: the N4, Lucan bypass; the N6, Athlone to Ballinasloe; the N7, Nenagh to Limerick; the N8, Cullahill to Cashel; the N8, Fermoy to Mitchelstown; and the N9, Waterford to Knocktopher.  Over &euro;2.5 billion worth of work will continue on 18 major road projects next year, including phase 2 of the M50 upgrade, the Limerick tunnel, the Waterford city bypass, the Castletown to Nenagh section of the N7 and the Kilcullen to Carlow and Carlow to Knocktopher sections of the N9.</P>
        <P>All these projects are proceeding on time and on budget and some will come in ahead of time.  Over 70% of the major inter-urban network should be open to traffic by the end of next year.  In the ten years 2000 to 2010, the State will have invested more than &euro;8 billion in this programme.  Already, the Dublin to the Border M1 route was opened to traffic in August 2007 and construction is well under way on the remaining major inter-urban projects.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The 2009 Estimates also include sufficient provision to meet contractual commitments on the various regional airport projects and to meet our share of the cost of the City of Derry Airport.  Notwithstanding the difficult financial position, the &euro;2.4 billion of Exchequer capital will allow us to make real and tangible progress in 2009 and to maintain our project planning into the future.  In addition to the almost &euro;2.4 billion of capital for Transport 21, over &euro;600 million is being provided for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads.  These roads are a key component of our national infrastructure and play a crucial role in the development of the country and the exploitation of crucial sectors such as tourism.  A further &euro;50 million is provided for the maintenance and management of national roads.</P>
        <P>I have provided almost &euro;40 million for the Road Safety Authority and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  The good news about road safety is that what we are doing is working &mdash; I acknowledge this is a concern shared across the House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Today, there are 35 more people alive than this day last year.  Road deaths in Ireland dropped by 30% in the period from 1997 to 2007.  A total of 472 people lost their lives on our roads in 1997 compared to 339 in 2007.  This downward trend, which has thankfully continued this year, was achieved despite the fact that there has been a large increase in the number of drivers and vehicles on our roads.</P><Col N="765"/>
        <P>According to the European road safety performance index programme, the PIN programme, which is run by the European Transport Safety Council, ETSC, Ireland is now ranked in the top ten best performing EU countries for road safety performance.  An ETSC report dated 8 October this year found Dublin to be the best performing European capital in reducing road deaths.</P>
        <P>On the matter of driving licences and learner drivers, following changes made in the regulations last October, the RSA and I made a commitment that all those on the waiting list on 30 October 2007, estimated to be 122,000 people, would be offered a test by mid-March 2008 and that by the end of June 2008, the waiting time for tests would be down to ten weeks.  Both of these commitments were met and every effort will be made to maintain this in 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>With much less money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Deputy Broughan, the RSA budget was more than doubled last year from, I understand, &euro;20 million to &euro;44 million.  Some &euro;20 million of this was for new works but &euro;10 million was specifically to clear the backlog.  We have cleared the backlog and have managed to maintain this position, and we continue to hold on to a sizeable proportion of the extra funding we got last year for that specific purpose.</P>
        <P>Funding for the Coast Guard and maritime administration is being maintained at its 2008 level of almost &euro;44 million.  The decision to maintain this level of funding in spite of the financial restrictions reflects the vital nature of the services being provided.  These services include the operations of the Coast Guard which entail maintenance of a helicopter marine emergency service at four bases around the country; funding of voluntary services of 55 Coast Guard stations based around the coastline; and a pollution-salvage response programme and related and incidental matters.  The Coast Guard maintains a marine radio communications network for marine and inland search and rescue, maritime safety information and vessel communication services.</P>
        <P>The Department is the regulatory authority for marine safety and marine environmental protection.  The main focus is on accident prevention through an appropriate combination of regulation, a heightening of safety awareness and enforcement.  The Department participates at both EU and international level in the development and implementation of safety policies and standards in this area.  The Marine Survey Office carries out the initial approval of designs and drawings for new vessels or modifications to existing vessels, and then carries out the necessary surveys.</P>
        <P>Provision is also being made for Exchequer grants towards the costs of the Commissioners of Irish Lights under an international agreement with the UK authorities regarding the provision of aids to navigation, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the weather buoys network and Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the International LORAN-C agreement on marine navigation.  Funding is also being provided for the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  The allocation for 2009 provides for expenditure of &euro;4 million on the Coast Guard&rsquo;s radio communications for essential upgrading of rescue centre radio communications.  Some &euro;27.5 million is being provided for the provision of the search and rescue helicopter services.</P>
        <P>The Government is to be commended on its decision to continue to target resources at investment in the country&rsquo;s economic infrastructure.  It is clear evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to, among other things, the Transport 21 programme and the delivery of a world-class transport system for Ireland.  Pursuit of this policy will leave us well placed to take advantage of a recovery in the world economy.</P>

	<P>Yesterday&rsquo;s budget was supposed to be a patriotic call to action, with a &ldquo;We are all in this together&rdquo; motto.  We are all in this together, not by choice, not because we should be or because the rest of Europe is in the same mire, but because the main party in power got us here.  Every citizen is being asked to join hands and share the pain of the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, but he has ignored the fact that some are better equipped to survive that pain than others.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance told us yesterday it is Government policy &ldquo;to target resources at those in greatest need&rdquo;.  If one takes that at face value, it sounds like a worthwhile policy.  The real test of this policy, however, was whether the Minister carried through on what he said, but, of course, he did not.</P>
        <P>Many people will ask why it is only now we are hearing about those in greatest need and why it is only now the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, is worried about people becoming dependent on social welfare.  Were there not opportunities in every budget in the past 11 years to develop these concerns and tackle them head on?</P>
        <P>Targeting was not the Government approach up to now.  The opposite was frequently the case.  I will give the House examples of the responses we have received from various Ministers in the past when we discussed targeting payments.  For example, the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Cullen, told us not even a year ago that the policy of support for pensioners has been for many years to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than supplements such as the living alone allowance &mdash; no targeting there.  The current Minister, Deputy Hanafin, voiced similar sentiments in speaking about the fuel allowance less than four months ago, when she stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The income maintenance needs of those on social welfare payments have also been met in recent years through significantly increased primary social welfare rates.  Government policy is focused on increasing social welfare rates to ensure that people can meet their basic living costs throughout the year and also achieve an improvement in quality of life.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is no targeting there.  Possibly the best examples are reserved for the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  As Minister with responsibility for children he did nothing to target child benefit towards those who need it most, despite many recommendations about the creation of a second tier.  Yet last night on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; he lectured us that the big issue in regard to child benefit is that:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;We have very high child poverty levels in this country still [at least he finally admitted it, but whether he will do anything about it is another question] because we insist on having an <Col N="767"/>indiscriminatory untargeted approach to this question.  I want to look at all the moneys that are available and see how we can target those who are most in need.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">Let us contrast that with his comments of just two years ago when he said &ldquo;Government makes choices and as Minister for children, I am delighted that this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government has consistently chosen to increase the level of direct payments to parents&rdquo;.  When did this change of heart come about?  When did the Minister change from being delighted to being indiscriminatory and untargeted?  Was it when he realised his predecessors failed children in the boom?  Now, those children will pay for it in a recession.  What will the Minister do to target children in poverty?  He will wait for a report.</P>
        <P>Budget 2009 failed to protect the most vulnerable groups in society, those who are welfare dependent, children, older people and lone parents.  The Minister for Finance should define for us what he means by &ldquo;little people&rdquo;.  It is not a phrase I like or use as it is disparaging.  If he meant the people I mentioned, he has not helped them, nor has he lived up to the commitments he had outlined.  The elderly got several knocks.  The withdrawal of the medical card will probably ensure the Health Service Executive will appoint a few more administrators to deal with that, but it will result in some elderly people opting not to attend a doctor.  In some parts of the country &euro;400 will not even pay for six visits to a doctor, and that is assuming one does not have to buy any medication or attend an accident and emergency unit.  The increase in the payment threshold for the drugs payment scheme by &euro;10 will affect elderly people.  One can but wonder at the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green backbenchers, as well as the token Independents, applauding increases in the old age pension that will not even keep pensioners in line with inflation.  Pensions should have been increased by at least &euro;10.  The &euro;7 increase will be wiped out when one examines the inflationary aspects of the budget.  The same pensioners will be hit by the increase in VAT, petrol and accident and emergency charges.</P>
        <P>I want to nail the lie about the increase in VAT.  My opposite number has been on local radio this morning claiming that it is all right because it is not on clothes or food and will not hurt the vulnerable.  That is to ignore the fact that it is on petrol and diesel.  Pensioners still drive cars.  It is on kettles.  Pensioners still like a cup of tea.  It is on kitchenware, furniture, washing machines and a host of other products that, believe it or not, pensioners still need to use.  Therefore, it hits them and, believe me, it hurts them.  The &euro;7 increase is pathetic.  If the Government that calls so frequently for Deputy Bruton to produce proposals had actually listened to them, it could have afforded a little bit more and that would have made a huge difference.</P>
        <P>In a debate in the House last week on energy poverty, promises galore were made that all problems would be addressed.  We know 227,000 households experience energy poverty.  From June 2000 to September 2008 electricity prices have increased by 134%.  We have among the highest energy prices in the European Union.  There was a recent rise of 17.5% in electricity costs and a 20% rise in gas prices.  The cost of home heating oil has risen dramatically, and further electricity and gas price increases are expected for January 2009.  Higher food and fuel prices are expected to continue to be above the general inflation rate of 4.3%.  Anyone listening last week would have thought fuel, insulation, central heating, better windows and doors were all on the way.  We were told the Government had a plan, an interdepartmental group had been set up and meetings were taking place.</P>
        <P>I received a response to a freedom of information request from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to the effect: &ldquo;I see there&rsquo;s an FOI request in from Olwyn Enright re contact between our Minister and the Minister for CER re fuel poverty in the last 12 months. The papers re the inter-depart group are all we&rsquo;d have really&rdquo;.  Those papers consist of six pages, <Col N="768"/>including two annexes outlining the current position, but nothing about how to address the issue unless it is all contained in the four lines that are blackened out, which I doubt.</P>
        <P>While welcome, the increase in the home energy savings scheme which has been allocated is four times more than the warmer homes scheme.  That shows again that those most in need have not been positively targeted.  How many houses will realistically be insulated with &euro;5 million?  How exactly is it to be supplemented by funds from industry?  Why has the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, chosen a scheme that targets the vulnerable as the one to be dependent on dig-outs from industry?</P>
        <P>People should know about the cynical nature in which energy poverty is being addressed.  We all know about the Government&rsquo;s love of press conferences and soft focus interviews.  So much so that this ethos now pervades among some officials.  E-mails back and forth from Department of Social and Family Affairs officials suggest &ldquo;a softer ministerial announcement &mdash; might take the form of a visit to someone who has had their house insulated etc.&rdquo;  That shows the way the issue is being addressed and it reflects poorly on both Ministers.  It will probably be difficult to find somebody who has had his or her house insulated, especially in certain parts of the country.</P>
        <P>A total of 250,000 people are currently on the live register and the figure is growing.  More than 300,000 people are expected to be on the dole by the end of 2009.  I suppose there should be some relief that the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, finally realises there is a problem.  When the matter was debated in the D&aacute;il only last May she told Opposition Deputies, in particular Deputy Penrose, that the Opposition was being &ldquo;a little bit dramatic&rdquo; about the live register figures.  It took until now for the Government to accept there is a problem, but no solutions have been offered for the unemployed.</P>
        <P>Last week Fine Gael outlined our tough but fair budget proposals that would get the economy back on track.  Our proposals addressed the underlying weaknesses in the economy as well as providing scope for positive things to be done for those most in need.  For a start, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance should have been increased by at least &euro;9.  The same arguments I made for pensioners apply.  The weak and vulnerable have been made scapegoats for Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s failure to manage the public purse.  The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, has attempted to disguise her cuts for people on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Let us be perfectly clear that the changes proposed have nothing to do with ending a dependency culture and everything to do with making cuts.  It is a reaction to a gaping hole in the public finances and it will savagely alter the lives of many vulnerable people.  The Minister hopes people will not sign on the live register because they will fail the means test or do not have enough contributions as that would massage the figures and keep the unemployment figures down.  The question she has failed to ask herself, and that she obviously failed to ask the Minister for Finance, is &ldquo;what is the alternative for these people?&rdquo;  Her heartless, cold, and clearly calculating approach, leaves these people with absolutely zero &mdash; no income, no options, probably no home, no bed, nothing.  It is not about ending a dependency culture, it is about ending any real type of life for those people.  It is offering them a life on the street, or in shelters, effectively offering them nothing.</P>
        <P>We have seen no overall plan, just blanket cuts thinly disguised.  Where is the plan for lone parents that got the Minister front page headlines last summer?  Where is her commitment to supporting family, as she said herself, not just in the more disadvantaged areas, as has been the case in the past, but the family generally?  Her statement utterly contradicts what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said yesterday.  Either way, she has slashed families.</P>
        <P>What if a family relies on illness benefit?  A &euro;10 increase in the family income supplement threshold would not be of any help to those people.  What about the young person who has <Col N="769"/>left school because of a disability, perhaps because disability made school impossible, or because they could not get the help they needed from the Department of Education and Science?  The Minister does not want that person depending on her.  So she cut &euro;200 per week from them and instead gave their parents &euro;300 per month.  She need not worry because the vulnerable know well they cannot depend on her.  After yesterday, they know they cannot depend on anybody on that side of the House.</P>
        <P>Where is the overall plan?  No homework has been done on the Minister&rsquo;s proposals yesterday.  That reminds me of the announcement on the over-70s medical card.  No homework was done, figures were wrong and now we are rowing back on it.  Decentralisation was based on a plan drawn up on the back of an envelope.  Again, no homework was done.  A total of 53 centres was announced.  That programme was slashed yesterday.  No homework was done on the early child care supplement that was affected yesterday also.  What alternative does the Minister propose for those people?</P>
        <P>There are no specific plans to help the unemployed.  We will obviously be told again about the famous 50 facilitators who will do God knows what.  The 50 facilitators were the subject of two separate press releases last summer.  In August each facilitator was to look after 3,600 lone-parent families.  By September, the same 50 people were also going to work on a one-to-one basis &mdash; this was in a statement &mdash; with 235,000 unemployed people.  The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, suggested that each facilitator was going to work on a one-to-one basis with 8,000 people, which is impossible.  This is the Minister&rsquo;s plan for the unemployed, although she will probably tell us that F&Aacute;S will work on the problem as well.  However, the numbers assigned to it are insignificant compared to the scale of the problem.  Instead, the criteria to qualify for the back-to-education allowance should have been changed.  Candidates aspiring to third level education have to be on social welfare for one year.  The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, claims she wanted to tackle the problem of people on long-term unemployment becoming dependent on benefit.  However, when those people try to stand up for themselves and take the opportunity to go to third level, they are told they must first draw the dole for a year and only then they may be allowed.  This is creating a dependency culture and it is an utter contradiction of what the Minister said.  We should have specific measures to minimise time for these people so they can get this payment.</P>
        <P>The Minister was asked a question on the mortgage interest supplement at a press conference yesterday which she was not able to answer.  Every one in the House will be dealing with this problem again and again as people lose their jobs.  Many people are unable to make their mortgage repayments and there should have been an increase in the supplement to facilitate such people.  The Department of Finance must examine how the scheme is administered as people are being refused credit on the basis that their mortgage is too high and for various other reasons outlined last week.  Such people must manage the mortgage they have.  This is the troubled position they are in and they need help.</P>
        <P>The early childhood supplement, announced in December 2005, was intended to help parents meet the cost of child care in Ireland because it was so expensive.  There was no homework done and the Government was unaware of the implications of this measure.  The fact that the payment was linked to child benefit meant it was available for children not living in Ireland.  Now, every one has a cut of six months, but there will still be money leaving the country to pay for child care in other countries where it is not as expensive.  That money probably will not be used for child care.  This is another example of poor planning and governance which leads to serious waste.</P>
        <P>The blanket 1% levy represents the most inadequate change of all in the budget.  It hits every worker in the country.  It makes me laugh that the Government boasted, during budget debates <Col N="770"/>in the past few years, about finally getting people on low incomes above the minimum wage.  What happened then?  The Government side of the House stood up, clapped and gave a standing ovation to the Minister for Finance.  Yesterday, the very same people were put back into the tax net.  What did those Deputies do?  They all stood up, clapped and applauded again.  This is the mentality with which we must deal.  Every worker in the country is now paying tax again to pay for the mistakes and waste of the Government.  It reminds me of the song, &ldquo;The Wild Rover&rdquo;.  The Government enjoyed the good times, spent all the money and is now asking vulnerable people in the country to pay for its recklessness.  The Government hopes the people will believe that it will not blow it this time, but the people will not believe it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done.  This must be one of the worst budgets in living memory.  Not only has the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, left the legacy of the Lenihan levy, but he will be long remembered as the man who, along with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, who took the medical card off sick, old, frail and terminally ill pensioners.  The stark fact is that 139,000 people qualified for the non-means tested medical card and if the Government has its way, only 14,000 will remain eligible for the medical card in January.  This means some 125,000 people stand to lose their medical card.  These people are elderly, suffer from chronic illness and are on long-term medication.  They have worked all their lives, served the country and this is what the Celtic tiger hands them back.</P>
        <P>This comes at a time when the elderly have seen their pensions obliterated by the turmoil in international markets, due, in some part, to the ineptitude of the Government&rsquo;s management of the economy over the past years.  It also comes at a time when some 125,000 frail, elderly people in the country who, through the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s ineptitude, have no help with long-term nursing home care.  Home care packages have been slashed too.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Harney, promised in the Chamber in December 2007 to publish the fair deal legislation before Christmas.  She promised again in January that it would be published before Easter.  At Easter she promised it before summer, during the summer she promised us it would be published this semester and now we are told it will be published tomorrow.  When will it come into law and when will people actually get relief?</P>
        <P>People are crucified paying &euro;50,000 per year.  Now, to rub salt into the wounds of those families and elderly people, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to reduce the tax rate from the marginal rate to the standard rate.  Heretofore, if one was paying &euro;50,000 per year, one received &euro;20,000 tax back, but now one will only receive &euro;10,000.  This is an extraordinary attack on the elderly and makes a mockery of the Taoiseach and the Government&rsquo;s contention that they will protect the vulnerable, the frail and the elderly.  We will see to what extent they will do this when examining other aspects of the budget.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach also told us earlier today that the fall in income tax allowance will not really matter because every one will have the fair deal by next year.  There are several issues with this claim.  Not every one will have access to the fair deal, because it will be capped according to the budget plan.  The allocation was set at &euro;110 million last year and it has now been capped at &euro;55 million this year, which is half the original amount.  Why is this and how many people will be able to avail of it?  The families unable to avail of it will find themselves penalised by the Government from the tax aspects of the budget.  Such people will find they are paying more and more.  There are several other aspects of the budget which are hitting families struggling at present to mind their elderly, care for their young and disabled and to pay their mortgages.</P>
        <P>We are being asked to believe that the fair deal will be introduced next year by a Minister who told us in January 2007 there would be no health cuts.  The same Minister, Deputy Harney, later admitted there would be health cuts but claimed these would not affect patients.  We have <Col N="771"/>all seen what has happened.  Operations have been cancelled throughout the country.  The situation in accident and emergency departments is such that there are 20% more people lying on trolleys now than there was this month last year.  This is despite the assertion that accident and emergency departments were in crisis and they would be addressed.</P>
        <P>The HSE works under the Minister for Health and Children and takes its ethos from her and from the Government.  This is the ethos that allowed the HSE in the north east to do nothing until May 2008 about thousands of mis-read X-rays that it knew of in September 2007.  There may have been ten or 20 of those people with tumours growing in their lungs since September 2007.  It waited eight months.  If the mother or brother of the Acting Chairman was such a patient, he would not wait eight months, but the HSE believes it is kosher to do so.  This is the same organisation that left 97 files belonging to women in Portlaoise dumped in a corner until it deemed a cohort was reached and it could proceed to deal with people who might have breast cancer.  This is the same organisation which takes home care packages off disabled children.  This is the same organisation and Minister which takes home help hours off the elderly and which presides over a system where people with cystic fibrosis die ten years earlier in this country than 50 miles north of here.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, at a press conference, the Minister for Health and Children mentioned that people over the age of 70 visit the doctor four times a year, on average.  I cannot find any evidence to support this proposition.  I do not know how the Minister, Deputy Harney, gets her figures.  My figures indicate that people over the age of 70 tend to visit the doctor between ten and 12 times a year.  Will the means test for the revised medical card scheme be index linked?  Will people continue to haemorrhage out of the scheme as they have in past years?  The scheme is not keeping pace with the cost of living.  It is important to reiterate that 139,000 people over the age of 70 currently have a medical card that is not means tested.  The Government&rsquo;s proposal will reduce that number to 14,000.  Some 125,000 people, or 90% of the total, will lose their entitlement to a medical card.  The Minister told us yesterday that the average cost to the State of an over-70s medical card, when doctors&rsquo; fees and drugs etc., are taken into account, is &euro;1,650.  That is the cost of a whole year&rsquo;s care and drugs.  It is also the cost of a single night in hospital.  The Government is penny wise and pound foolish.  This cut is all the more savage because it is at the expense of the elderly.</P>
        <P>I read an article written by a young lady, Ms Orla Tinsey, in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Times</i>.  Ms Tinsey believed the Minister for Health and Children when she said that isolation rooms would be provided at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital and that a new cystic fibrosis unit would be brought into operation.  Ms Tinsey is in a ward with many other sick people, as a result of the Minister&rsquo;s breach of her promise, so she is open to all sorts of infection.  I have mentioned previously that the HSE takes home care packages from disabled children.  I will not go back over that ground.  The Minister told us yesterday that pensioners will lose their medical cards from 1 January.  The HSE intends to write to 139,000 pensioners to invite them to send details of their income to that organisation.  I wonder when the excess managers in the HSE will receive letters inviting them to avail of redundancy packages.  There was no clarity on this issue yesterday because the Government&rsquo;s focus is on the soft option of hitting the elderly, rather than tackling the real problem of the bungling bureaucracy known as the HSE.</P>
        <P>The office has been inundated today with calls from people in all parts of the country.  I will mention one case, that of a 72 year old former civil servant with pulmonary fibrosis who has three years to live.  He asked me to mention his name in this Chamber, but I will not do so.  He was crying as he told me he wants to enjoy the three years he has left.  He is already paying &euro;200 a month for medication that is not covered by the medical card because it is experimental. <Col N="772"/> He will now have to pay an additional &euro;100 a month for medication and a further sum for doctors&rsquo; fees.  Am I supposed to tell the man in question, who is at the end of his tether, that he should be patriotic?  This outrageous attack on the elderly will be remembered for a long time.  Despite the weasel words to the contrary that we have heard from the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Taoiseach, I do not doubt that this budget will go down in the annals as one that hurt the most vulnerable people in our society.</P>
        <P>The more we examine this budget, the more examples of cynicism we see.  Some &euro;10 million has been provided for mental health services.  What happened to the &euro;50 million that was promised for such services in A Vision for Change?  A further &euro;10 million has been provided for disability services.  How far will that go?  People with disabilities who are under the age of 18 will now be eligible for domiciliary care allowance, rather than disability allowance.  How more cynical can one be?  Such people will get just &euro;350 a month under the domiciliary care allowance, whereas they were getting &euro;200 a week under the disability allowance.  The families of disabled children will lose &euro;450 a month as a result of this change.  Some 125,000 pensioners will now have to pay the health levy.  An unexpected consequence of the introduction of the medical card scheme was that such people did not have to pay the health levy, but they will now have to do so.  Given that we were told at the time that the cost of the scheme to the Exchequer would be &euro;200 million, how much will this measure cost the elderly now?</P>
        <P>The threshold for the drugs payment scheme is to be increased from &euro;90 to &euro;100.  The 1.6 million people who are registered under the scheme will be affected by this measure.  A new &euro;400 grant has been established as a sop to people over 70 years of age.  This proposal mirrors one of the failed policies of the neo-conservative Bush Administration.  If people are given inadequate resources, they will be forced to ration their health care services.  It is despicable.  The &euro;3.5 million that was allocated by the Minister in the 2007 budget for the development of 1,100 day care places was not spent for that purpose.  Some &euro;0.5 million has gone missing from the fund.  The same thing can be said of home help hours and home care packages.  Some 250 paramedical and other allied professionals were supposed to have been recruited in 2007, but that did not happen.  The &euro;2.5 million that was allocated for the meals on wheels service in 2006 was not spent on that service.  It was used to provide other services to older people.  Six elder abuse officer posts remain vacant, despite the fact that money was allocated for them in 2006.  It is obvious that the HSE is not serious about dealing with elder abuse.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;20 million was assigned to fast-track 860 public long-stay nursing home beds, but just 188 beds have been provided under the scheme.  The accident and emergency charge has increased from &euro;66 to &euro;100.  Private bed costs have increased by 20% in our public hospitals, with a consequent impact on private health insurance.  As many of this country&rsquo;s amputees are over the age of 70, they will be affected by the change in medical card eligibility.  They will now have to pay the full cost of their appliances.  It will bring more hardship on those least able to deal with it.  Has the Minister considered the contractual issues?  I refer to patients, rather than to doctors.  Many people over the age of 70 have medical cards which say &ldquo;valid until 2011&rdquo;.  They have planned their finances on the basis of having a medical card.  There will be legal issues in that regard.  In its search for a quick fix, the Government has gone for the poorly thought-out soft option.  How can people get back into the VHI system?  People who have stopped their VHI payments will have to wait for five or ten years before they can make a claim in respect of a previous illness.  What good is that to a man in his mid-70s or 80s?  It is no use.  Has the Government index linked the means test?</P>
        <P>It is clear that Fianna F&aacute;il has forgotten its slogan of some years ago, suggesting that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the poor.  It is noteworthy that the only group to have welcomed this budget is the Construction Industry Federation, led by the Minister for Health and Chil<Col N="773"/>dren&rsquo;s old buddy, Tom Parlon.  Families will reflect on this budget as the full extent of the Government&rsquo;s ineptitude dawns slowly on them.  College fees &mdash; let us call them what they are &mdash; are back.  Transport costs are increasing.  Irish taxpayers are the only people in western Europe who have to pay tax on tax.  The Lenihan levy taxes one on one&rsquo;s entire income, even though one has already paid tax on it.  It is actually a 3% tax on one&rsquo;s tax, which is extraordinary.  We should not muddy the waters by referring to &euro;400 payments &mdash; it is clear that 125,000 elderly people who will lose their medical cards.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The events which we have witnessed over the past few weeks on the international money markets have been characterised by a loss of confidence in financial systems.  The scale, depth and impact of this loss of confidence has been unprecedented in our lifetime.  Confronted with a challenge of such deep international proportions, the Government was faced with making difficult choices in the budget announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  However, the choices made were necessary to restore confidence in our economy at national and international level by bringing stability and certainty to the public finances.  They were also necessary to protect the most vulnerable in our society and to build a solid base to ensure we are well positioned to benefit when the economic cycle turns around.</P>
        <P>In this budget, we have moved to send out a message that Ireland is still open for business, in spite of the current difficulties that are shared worldwide.  We have also refocused our spending within the resources available to us to deliver increases in priority areas, including social welfare, health and education.</P>
        <P>My Department and its agencies will play a key role in working through the current economic circumstances and in making sure that we are well positioned to reap the opportunities that will undoubtedly arise when the global situation improves.  We will do this by continuing to work to attract foreign direct investment, by helping Irish businesses to develop and grow their exports, by continuing to prioritise investment in science, technology and innovation, and by providing supports to small businesses.  We will also continue to invest in upskilling the labour force and ensure that adequate retraining and support services are available for those who have recently lost their jobs.</P>
        <P>The allocation for my Department in the 2009 Estimates published yesterday amounts to &euro;1.951 billion.  This includes &euro;1.569 billion in Exchequer funding and just under &euro;382 million from the national training fund.  Like my Government colleagues, I am prioritising spending in a balanced and responsible way to ensure that the economy gets the best return for the level of resources available.</P>
        <P>The strategy for science, technology and innovation was launched by the Government in 2006 as a long-term strategic initiative to underpin the future economic prosperity of this country.  Capital funding for science, technology and innovation programmes in my Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2009 will increase by &euro;10.4 million, or 3.5%, compared with 2008.  This will bring capital investment in this area of my Department&rsquo;s budget to &euro;309.3 million, reflecting the importance of this priority for the Government.  This level of support sends a clear signal to businesses based in Ireland that the Government is continuing to support their efforts to develop new products, to stay competitive and to win new markets.</P>
        <P>The strategy for science, technology and innovation is still in its early days, but already we have seen the fruits of our investment in this area.  For example, some of the world&rsquo;s leading companies have chosen Ireland as a base for their research activities.  This reflects the reputation which Ireland has built as an emerging force in the area of research and development.  Forty-five research and development investments were supported by IDA Ireland in 2007, at an overall value of &euro;2.5 billion.  Total research and development spending across all sectors of the economy reached &euro;2.33 billion in 2006.  It would be short-sighted in the extreme to halt this progress.  Science and innovation are the future growth areas on a worldwide scale.  The rewards to industry for developing new and innovative products can be immense, with consequent rewards for the economy in terms of employment opportunities and investment.  Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland will continue to work with industry and academia to promote research further and to ensure that the commercial value of new technology and innovation is realised.</P><Col N="775"/>
        <P>The enhancements to the tax credit scheme for research and development announced by the Minister for Finance yesterday are also a sign of the Government&rsquo;s commitment in this area.  The research and development tax credit, which can be offset against a company&rsquo;s corporation tax liability, is being increased from 20% to 25% with effect from 1 January next year.  This measure will further enhance our competitiveness as a location for new internationally mobile research-related investment and will also encourage existing overseas and indigenous firms to increase their level of research activity.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that the Commission on Taxation is to investigate options for incentivising the holding and development of intellectual property.  This is an area that has become important globally in recent years and we need to ensure that our tax regime reflects this.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has been very successful in highlighting the opportunities which Ireland offers to leading edge multi-national companies down through the years.  At present, there are over 1,000 IDA Ireland supported companies in Ireland, employing 136,000 people.  Over 9,000 new jobs were created by those companies in 2007, 114 new investments were delivered, involving total future capital investment of over &euro;2,3 billion, and IDA Ireland-supported companies yielded &euro;3 billion in corporation tax receipts and contributed &euro;16 billion in direct expenditure in the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>Ireland continues to be an attractive location for services, high-tech manufacturing and research and innovation activities.  IDA Ireland is now winning higher value foreign direct investment in new and emerging areas such as Internet and media business.  In the first half of this year, IDA Ireland announced 22 investments with a capital value of &euro;916 million and a potential to create 1,600 jobs. This compares favourably with figures for 2007.  An allocation of &euro;137 million, including staff and administrative costs, has been provided to IDA Ireland in my Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2009.  This will enable the agency to continue its work in attracting companies to Ireland and to enhance its presence overseas.  The Exchequer allocation will be supplemented by IDA Ireland&rsquo;s own resource income from grant refunds, deposit interest and the rent and sale of properties.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland will continue to support indigenous companies, with an allocation of &euro;56.3 million from its grants to industry programme in 2009.  The fundamental objective for Enterprise Ireland in its 2008-10 strategy is to drive export growth in the challenging global environment.  Success in overseas markets will generate wealth that will sustain prosperity and employment throughout all parts of this country.  There is no doubt that Irish enterprises face difficult challenges in the short to medium term.. However, this makes it all the more important that Enterprise Ireland is in a position to provide all the assistance possible to companies to bolster competitiveness, focus investment and generate innovative solutions.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s funding for grants to industry will remain virtually unchanged from 2008.</P>
        <P>It is also vitally important that we support small businesses at this time.  Small and medium-sized businesses account for over 97% of companies in Ireland and the sector employs in excess of 800,000 people.  Supports for small business, through the county and city enterprise boards, will increase next year by almost &euro;3 million, or 9%, to &euro;34.8 million.  The enterprise boards have been particularly effective in their ability to respond to the needs of micro-enterprise at local level.  Over the past 15 years, they have assisted almost 20,000 projects and helped to support the creation of 35,000 jobs.  The increased 2009 allocation recognises the need for access to practical business information and supports for small companies and the importance of continuing to promote entrepreneurship at this time.</P>
        <P>The tax relief measures announced by the Minister for Finance for new start-up companies will also help to grow small businesses and promote an entrepreneurial culture.  Under the <Col N="776"/>measures announced yesterday by the Minister, new start-up companies which begin trading in 2009 will be exempt from tax, including capital gains tax, in each of their first three years to the extent that their tax liability does not exceed &euro;40,000.  With the consolidation of our low corporate tax base and capital allowances for certain energy-efficient equipment, this is a very good budget for businesses of every size.</P>
        <P>In spite of the need to introduce a tough budget, the Government has taken care to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society.  In particular, we recognise the impact which unemployment has on individuals, their families and their communities.  Above all, we must prevent the drift into long-term unemployment and avoid a return to the structural unemployment which we witnessed in the 1980s.  It is important that we continue to invest in our people, to upskill those in employment and to provide support services and retraining for those who have lost their job.</P>
        <P>Total investment for labour market programmes in my Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2009 will amount to &euro;1.083 billion, or 56% of my total budget, including the national training fund contribution.  Of this, &euro;1.05 billion will be delivered through F&Aacute;S.  Within the F&Aacute;S budget, funding for community employment and job initiative schemes will be increased by 2%, from &euro;439 million to &euro;450 million.  This will enable F&Aacute;S to continue to support a minimum of 22,500 participants on these programmes next year.  Funding for F&Aacute;S services to people with disabilities is also being increased by 2% on the projected 2008 outturn.  A total of &euro;77.7 million in its 2009 budget is ring-fenced for specific employment and training programmes for people with disabilities.  In addition, people with disabilities can avail of mainline F&Aacute;S programmes and services.  The allocation from the National Training Fund for training the unemployed has been increased by &euro;9.5 million, or 5% in 2009, to &euro;208.3 million.  This allocation will help workers who have recently lost their jobs, including redundant apprentices, through training and re-skilling.  Every effort will be made to help those apprentices who have been let go by their employers to complete their training or to be retrained for alternative and emerging opportunities.</P>
        <P>While labour market programmes have been refocused to assist the unemployed, funding for upskilling those in employment in 2009 will still amount to &euro;168.5 million and will be delivered primarily by F&Aacute;S and Skillnets.  At workplace level, the National Employment Rights Authority will continue to promote compliance with employment law and will carry out a programme of inspections to ensure that workers&rsquo; rights are being upheld.  The allocation to the National Employment Rights Authority for 2009 is &euro;9.7 million.  The Health and Safety Authority will promote, monitor and ensure compliance with workplace safety and has been allocated a budget of &euro;23.7 million for next year.</P>
        <P>In addition to the priorities I have outlined, my Department will continue to ensure that markets operate in a fair and regulated way for companies and consumers.  The international events of recent weeks have demonstrated how important it is to regulate sectors and the profound impact on an economy and on society if these are left unchecked.  Within my Department&rsquo;s remit the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement will continue to address its twin objectives of encouraging compliance with company law and bringing to account those who breach their obligations.  The Competition Authority and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority will also continue their roles of promoting compliance with legislation in the areas of competition law and the accountancy profession, respectively.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I announced plans to merge the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  Competition and consumer policies are highly complementary and share a common goal of enhancing consumer welfare.  The merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency will ensure improved co-ordination of these two policy areas. <Col N="777"/> The Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, and its predecessor, the Office of Consumer Affairs, have served the Irish public well for many years.  They have protected consumers, ensured fairer competition for businesses and worked with professionalism and commitment in the interests of the public.  However, a single body overseeing the areas of competition and consumer protection will allow for a more consistent approach to policy implementation and resource allocation.  The synergies resulting from bringing together the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency should improve services to the public and should result in a better return for the investment currently being made in two separate bodies.</P>
        <P>The road ahead is still somewhat uncertain, given the worldwide scale of the current economic difficulties.  However, with the prudent approach to spending announced yesterday, allied to the measures announced by the Minister for Finance to stimulate productive investment, the Government has demonstrated real leadership and has invested in building a confident future for us all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This budget comes at a critical and defining time for our country.  We all know that the international economic climate has altered radically in relatively recent times.  The scale of this challenge and the pace at which circumstances have changed have combined to lift this budget out of the routine of economic management to one of critical importance to the future well-being of our country.  This is no time for adjustments at the margins. This is a time for strong, firm and decisive leadership.  It is a time to put the interests of our country to the fore and sectoral interests firmly on the back-burner.  In framing this budget the Government has been very aware of the central role of education to economic progress and social cohesion.  This awareness is reflected in an increased allocation for education.</P>
        <P>The gross allocation for the education Vote in 2009 is just over &euro;9.6 billion, representing an increase of &euro;302 million and an overall increase of 3.2% on 2008.  Education has received unprecedented levels of support from the Government in terms of increases in overall funding over the past ten years with education spending now more than treble what it was in 1997 when overall funding was just &euro;3.1 billion.</P>
        <P>The overall capital allocation for 2009 is being increased to &euro;889 million.  This represents an increase of nearly 10% compared with 2008.  The Government recognises the essential importance of continuing to invest in our future productive capacity during the current economic downturn.  This increased allocation will provide for a very significant construction programme and will see major projects under way across the country.  This is in addition to the smaller capital projects that will be offered for public tender under the devolved grant schemes.  As well as providing employment in the construction sector, it is my firm belief that increasing competition within the sector will provide increased value for money, enabling us to derive maximum benefit from this investment.  In the tenders being received in the Department, we have noted a drop of 15% to 20% in the prices being quoted.</P>
        <P>The 2009 capital allocation for schools will enable my Department to complete 26 major projects and commence construction on another 62 major projects.  It will permit completion of 100 smaller projects on site and allow another 80 projects previously approved to progress to completion.  In addition, a further 2,600 primary and post-primary places will be delivered in developing areas under the fast-track programme for September 2009.</P>
        <P>As I previously indicated, I will be making some provision for a summer works scheme for 2009.  The summer works scheme has been extremely successful in enabling schools to address long-standing infrastructural issues.  Since the scheme was introduced in 2004, 3,000 projects, costing &euro;300 million have been completed.  Work will also continue on my Department&rsquo;s public private partnership programme, with four post-primary schools due to commence construction <Col N="778"/>before the end of 2008.  When completed, these schools will provide 2,700 school places.  Procurement has commenced on the second bundle of six schools and work on identifying the third and fourth bundles of schools is well under way.  When compared with the level of activity under the schools building programme in 1997, when only 42 large-scale primary and post-primary school projects were under way with a capital allocation of just &euro;92 million, it is clear that the scale of delivery in 2008 is unprecedented and is an exceptional achievement.  I am very pleased I will be able to maintain a similar level of activity in 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Turning to higher education, the capital allocation is being increased by over &euro;100 million to &euro;265 million in 2009.  This represents an increase of almost 50% compared with the projected outturn for 2008.  The 2009 capital allocation is one of the highest annual levels of investment in core higher educational infrastructure over the past ten years and represents an increase of just over 75% when compared with the funding of just &euro;68 million provided for universities and institutes of technology in 1997.  The allocation will enable me to continue the programme of investment in upgrading and modernising undergraduate facilities at institutes of technology, universities and other colleges.  In addition, it is intended that the first bundle of third level PPP projects will be offered to the market this year, with the second and third bundles following at six-monthly intervals.</P>
        <P>On the research side, the increased investment will allow continued progress in delivering previously approved projects under the programme for research in third level institutions.  The year 2008 marks the tenth  anniversary of the programme for research in third level institutions with total investment under PRTLI to date of &euro;865 million, including &euro;648 million direct Exchequer funding provided by the Government.  I will also make an announcement in the coming weeks in relation to PRTLI 5.  I will be providing for a further round of funding under the research facilities enhancement scheme for the improvement of research infrastructure.  This competitively awarded scheme has been very successful in providing targeted moneys for restoring and updating equipment and facilities where strategic research is ongoing.  In the course of the next few weeks and months, I will announce details of specific new projects and programmes that will be funded from this allocation in 2009.  Overall, the increased capital allocation for the higher education sector will provide better infrastructure for students, lecturers, researchers and others working in Ireland&rsquo;s higher education sector.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Given the scale of the economic circumstances facing the country, I do not for a moment pretend the allocation for education, enhanced though it is, allows us to avoid tough decisions and choices.  The &euro;8.5 billion current expenditure on education is predominantly on frontline services.  It is the grossest dishonesty, as the Opposition has done, to peddle trite and simplistic notions that the scale of adjustment required in education can be met by painless and populist measures.  Approximately 80% of the current allocation goes on the salaries of front line teachers, SNAs, lecturers and others working across the education sector.  A further &euro;500 million goes on school running costs.  Other large elements of the budget include areas such as provision for school transport.  It is disingenuous to pretend that necessary adjustments required in the national interest can be obtained without having recourse to these areas.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>On this occasion, when Deputy Hayes is outlining policy, I suggest he put less emphasis on sound bites and more on substance.  It is essential to place the current measures in a proper context.  In 2009, taking account of the measures announced today, the net pay bill for teachers&rsquo; salaries and pensions will increase by almost &euro;300 million as a result of a combination of pay increases and the full year costs of the salaries of teachers appointed this September.  The allocation provides for increased enrolment in primary schools and the continued growth in provision for special needs in primary and post-primary schools.  In addition, pay costs will rise by some &euro;40 million to cover the full year costs of additional SNAs in the system this September as well as provision for additional posts next September.  Earlier <Col N="780"/>this year, the Government specifically shielded teachers and SNAs from the general 3% payroll cuts announced for the public sector.</P>
        <P>In making the hard choices required in the current circumstances, the Government has acted in a balanced and measured way.  To help limit the growth in public sector pay, it is necessary to increase the number of pupils required for additional classroom appointments in both primary and post-primary schools by one pupil with effect from September 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Another promise gone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the case of fee-paying post-primary schools the number of pupils required will increase by two.  This change to the pupil-teacher ratio will increase average class sizes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is that in the programme for Government?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is also necessary to reintroduce a cap of two on the number of language support teachers per school.  However, in response to Deputy Hayes&rsquo;s speech, support will be provided to help reduce the impact of the cap on those schools with very large numbers of pupils requiring language support.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>On school funding, improvements are being made to the rates of capitation funding available to schools with a total value of &euro;20 million.  I cited here to the Opposition spokesperson on education that it was my desire to increase the levels.  Despite the stringent financial circumstances, at primary level the standard rate of capitation grant has increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil in 1997 to &euro;178.58 in 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have also made provision for an increase of &euro;8 per pupil in equalisation funding provided to voluntary secondary schools.  A number of specialist grants have been abolished with the general capitation increases aimed at giving schools maximum flexibility in how they use their grant allocation.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Where can we get details of this?</P>

	<P>I have also decided to regularise an anomalous situation whereby fee-charging schools under Catholic patronage were not in receipt of certain grants, including the support services grant, that were paid to other fee-charging schools.  This measure will see all fee-charging schools treated on the same basis regardless of religious denomination.</P>
        <P>The education of students with special educational needs continues to be a key investment priority for Government.  This is reflected in the fact that there are now more than 19,000 teaching staff and SNAs working in our schools.  The full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act by the target date of October 2010 is being deferred.  Services will continue to be provided by my Department on a non-statutory basis.</P>

	<P>The Estimates provision for higher education is &euro;1,844 million as compared to &euro;1,887 in 2008.  The Estimate allows for an increase in the student registration charge from its current rate of &euro;900 to &euro;1,500 in individual institutions for the academic year 2009-10 and combined, this funding is generally in line with the projected outturn in 2008.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the current economic climate, it was not possible to provide an increase in current funding for the sector in 2008.  However, the current level of funding must be seen in the context of the substantial increases in funding for the third level sector in recent years, whereby the overall provision to the sector, including capital provision, has increased to some &euro;2 billion in 2008.  This is an increase of 33% in the last four years and an increase of 135% since 1997.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with my colleague, Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell and to refer, in the time afforded to me, to matters in the justice area.  The importance this Government attaches to justice and crime matters was reflected in the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s <Col N="783"/>speech yesterday.  Not once, in a speech which ran to almost 8,000 words, did he refer to the justice budget.  This was very surprising given that he recently served as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a startling omission given the way crime is thriving in this country and having regard to the grave concerns that families and decent people have about matters of crime and justice.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has taken the axe to Garda overtime.  He has done so in the knowledge that incidents involving bombs and other explosive devices are up over 300% on last year.  This year alone we have had 76 incidents involving pipe bombs and other dangerous devices.  He has done so in the knowledge that the drugs trade continues to boom.  The streets are awash with heroin and cocaine.  If the rule of thumb that the Garda successfully intercepts 10% of the drugs that enter the State applies, we are in serious trouble.  So far this year, the Garda has seized drugs worth &euro;68 million.  The sinister involvement of organisations such as the INLA in the drugs trade should sound a loud warning bell to the State.  Organised criminals and criminal gangs cannot be given a free pass, irrespective of the downturn in the economic situation.</P>
        <P>Gangland bosses and their associates are uncorking the champagne bottles and toasting the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the Garda overtime cuts that we are now facing.  The Minister has chosen to cut overtime despite the obvious need for greater resources to rein in gangland criminals.  This is obvious not only from the availability of drugs but also by an analysis of the steep rise in the number of shootings taking place year on year.  The number of shootings jumped by 54% between 2003 and 2007, from 211 incidents to 325.  In the first six months of 2008 there were 116 reported shootings.  Estimates suggest there were 19 gangland-related killings in 2005, 21 in 2006,16 in 2007 and 15 so far in 2008.  Meanwhile, knife crime has jumped over 300% in four years.</P>
        <P>In this morning&rsquo;s newspapers it was reported that the Dublin County Coroner opened inquests into no less than eight violent gun deaths yesterday.  Among the eight victims was apprentice plumber Anthony Campbell, an innocent bystander shot dead in a botched gangland attack.  Anthony Campbell was in the wrong place at the wrong time and paid the price with his life.  How many more gruesome murders must take place before crime becomes relevant enough for a mention by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, in his budget speech?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will argue that he has off-set taking a hatchet to the Garda overtime budget by providing more garda&iacute;.  Another way to express that argument is that he has given with one hand and taken back with the other.  This country needs additional resources to combat crime.  Organised crime costs this State a fortune every year in terms of deaths, drugs and prison sentences.  Failing to tackle criminals by providing necessary resources is not a money-saving measure, irrespective of how the Government tries to spin it.</P>
        <P>Ring fencing money for Operation Anvil is a welcome and sensible step, but it is not enough.  Operation Anvil alone cannot address the criminality of gangland bosses.  Maintaining and protecting resources for one single Garda operation is a flimsy response to the challenges that organised crime pose to this State.</P>
        <P>Another area where the Minister is claiming he is saving money is in the prison sector.  This is another false promise because reducing budgets as a short-term measure will cost us dearly in the long run.  Let us look for a moment at the current situation in our prisons.  The latest figures show that 50% of prisoners re-offend within four years of their release while 27% find themselves back behind bars within a year.  The taxpayers of Ireland are spending &euro;91,000 per prisoner per annum to maintain a revolving door prison system.</P>
        <P>The Council of Europe anti-torture committee is one of a number of august bodies to express horror at the state of Ireland&rsquo;s prisons.  Its most recent report on Irish prisons, published in <Col N="784"/>October 2007, described a scenario where inter-prisoner violence was rife, fuelled by the widespread availability of illegal drugs and the existence of a gang culture within the prison system.  Three prisons were singled out as being particularly dangerous in this context, namely, Limerick, Mountjoy and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</P>
        <P>A report in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers detailed a violent attack in the State&rsquo;s most secure prison at Portlaoise.  The prison governor was subjected to a series of threats and intimidation, culminating in a physical assault.  In May this year it was reported that in Limerick Prison the number of prisoners who have had to be put into isolation for their own safety has trebled over the past two years.  We hear about the lack of prison security on a weekly basis.  This summer we heard it reported on the court record that a gangland boss continued to engage in his criminal empire building from behind prison bars.</P>
        <P>The agreed programme for Government promises to &ldquo;invest significantly in rehabilitation for prisoners&rdquo;.  This is a promise that must be delivered on urgently.  Last year 10,000 drugs tests were carried out in Irish prisons, 40% of which were positive.  A total of 75% of prisoners in Mountjoy tested positive for drugs.  There is widespread agreement that the situation in Mountjoy Prison, in terms of drug use, violence and violations of human rights, is totally unsustainable.  Is the situation to be allowed to fester for the next 12 months and perhaps to worsen as a consequence of budget cuts?</P>
        <P>Despite the lofty promises contained in the programme for Government, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has already revealed his contempt for rehabilitation services.  Before the budget was even agreed he slashed support services for ex-offenders, placing vulnerable men at risk of homelessness and addiction problems.  He has withdrawn funding from Harristown House, a counselling and addiction centre at Castlerea, County Roscommon and from the Kazelain project in Sligo which provides accommodation for former offenders and homeless men.  The grim consequences of these moves have been predicted by the experts and we are likely to pay the real price in the near future.</P>
        <P>Cuts have been made to the prison sector at a time when health experts have called for the reform and expansion of prison psychiatric services following revelations that more than one in ten new male inmates has a psychiatric disorder and one in 20 is in need of transfer to a psychiatric institution.</P>
        <P>The Minister may think that what happens within prisons is not a cause for concern to most people.  However, it is hard working people and families who are always the victims of crime.  It is hard-pressed taxpayers who are footing the bill for the dysfunctional Prison Service that the Minister presides over and I want to know what he proposes to do about it in 2009.</P>
        <P>What is the fate of the Thornton Hall prison project, which has already cost the taxpayer almost &euro;37 million?  Thornton Hall is a perfect example of how wilful waste makes woeful want.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General concluded that the State paid &ldquo;at least twice&rdquo; the market value for the land when it stumped up &euro;29.9 million to acquire the site.</P>
        <P>Prison capital took a 10% cut in 2008, and received no increase in capital for 2009.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, recently stated there was no Plan B regarding Thornton Hall.  I would like to know what is the status of Plan A.  It is important to note that spending on existing prisons fell on the basis that Thornton Hall was proceeding.  In the 2008 Estimates, the buildings and equipment budget was reduced by 44%.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, recently announced to great fanfare that he was rolling out the joint policing committees and expanding the programme from 29 to 114 committees throughout the State.  Last year, &euro;1 million was provided for the 29 committees.  Is there provision for a <i>pro rata</i> increase to fund the additional <Col N="785"/>85 committees?  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on this when he addresses the matter later.</P>
        <P>What about the Garda station building programme?  What about the resources for community policing which is supposed to be a hallmark of Government policy in terms of increasing the visibility of the Garda force on the streets?  This budget has shown us that tackling crime is far down the list of priorities for the Government.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, a master of spin, has attempted to twist the facts to disguise the short-sightedness and mean-spiritedness of his cuts.  He has reduced Garda overtime just days after a key survey revealed that people are crying out for greater Garda visibility, with 75% of those surveyed wanting to see an improved Garda service by having more garda&iacute; visible on the streets.</P>
        <P>The Minister has cut funding to the Prison Service thereby perpetuating the cycle of crime.  He has even cut the budget for the Irish Human Rights Commission, a body established under the Good Friday Agreement.  I am sure he will outline in greater detail the particulars for the proposed merger of two bodies and the consequent dilution of power and influence of them both.</P>
        <P>The consequences of these cuts will be shown in the fullness of time.  I am confident the people will not be fooled.  Despite the spin, they have seen this budget for what it is, an attack on decent hard-pressed people and they will see through the spin coming from the Department for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is the same as that which we saw from the Minister for Education and Science earlier in the debate.  The chickens have come home to roost.  The Galway tent school of economics provided us with yesterday&rsquo;s budget which showed the Government has blown the boom in a most extraordinary fashion and the people have been given the bill to pay the price.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>This budget is probably the worst and most severe budget for the vulnerable, the lower paid and those on a middle income since I can remember.  This budget will hit lower and middle income families and more particularly the old and the infirm.</P>
        <P>What is proposed with regard to medical cards for the over 70s is that more than 125,000 of the 139,000 in receipt of medical cards, or 90%, will lose their medical cards.  This has implications not only for medical expenses, it also has implications for accident and emergency charges and long-stay beds.  It also has an income tax implication with regard to health contributions.  The Government has not made this public but any person earning more than &euro;26,000 a year without being in receipt of a medical card will pay a 2% health contribution.  This means not only are they caught for the 1% levy on occupational pensions but they are caught for another 2%.  This is a 3% Lenihan super-levy on old people.</P>
        <P>People who telephoned Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme today are worried about their elderly parents and the fact they left the VHI because in early 2000 Fianna F&aacute;il gave medical cards to those aged over 70.  If they can even get back into the VHI they face a ten year waiting time for the conditions they had prior to leaving the VHI.  They must wait two years before any new conditions will be covered.</P>
        <P>Is this fair for a return of &euro;100 million?  At present, the Government is guaranteeing the banks to the tune of &euro;500 billion.  I expect the Government to obtain more than &euro;100 million.  It will see &euro;100 million in savings in terms of medical cards but it will also receive money from the 2% levy from many of these people.  Shame on the Government.  I expect the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers to come out in support of this measure.  It must be reversed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, knows it and I have no doubt constituents have contacted him.</P><Col N="786"/>
        <P>Everyone here has elderly parents.  When this was introduced people planned for life on the basis of it.  They are now facing bills of &euro;1,200 for the drugs refund scheme and paying fees to doctors and hospital charges.  A constituent who rang me expects it to cost &euro;2,500 extra per year which the person can ill-afford.  These people have paid their dues to society.  The Government proposes to introduce a measure which is unfair, crude and defies logic.  I expect the Government to reverse the decision.  A typical retired person on a &euro;30,000 occupational pension will pay almost &euro;1,000 extra in tax to the Government.  He or she does not even know how the Government will use the money because to date it has wasted money and not used it wisely.</P>
        <P>The Government states it will save &euro;150 million in terms of nursing home charges and normal medical expenses.  Every family with an elderly parent in a nursing home receives tax relief on it, many of them at the higher rate.  Typically, it costs approximately &euro;50,000 to keep a person in a nursing home.  People will lose &euro;10,000 on this.</P>
        <P>Going through all the measures, this budget is absolutely crippling for the elderly with the 1% levy, the 2% super-levy on health contributions, the tax on savings through DIRT increased by 3%, VAT increased by 0.5%, accident and emergency charges increased by 50%, the cost of drugs increased by 11% and they must also pay doctors fees.  The old age pension has increased by just over 3%, less than the rate of inflation.  The Government talks about being a caring government and looking after the elderly.  The budget reverses this.</P>
        <P>Last night, the Taoiseach stated the income levy was a fair measure.  Over successive budgets, Fianna F&aacute;il boasted that it brought countless thousands of people out of the tax net.  In last year&rsquo;s budget it was stated that 878,000 were not in the tax net.  This does not apply any more.  Everyone is paying tax.  The Government has gone for the soft option.  Lone parents will not be taxed on social welfare benefit but will be hit by the 1% income levy if they get a job.  The Minister of State at the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Billy Kelleher, knows small business employers will have to compensate their employees for the levy.  It will mean uncompetitiveness and job losses.  The budget contains no provisions to arrest the rate of unemployment.  The budget&rsquo;s measures will make it worse by adding 1% to the inflation rate and sapping money out of the economy.  It will sink us further into recession and eventually a depression.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael, on the other hand, proposed no increases in taxes but increases in social welfare to keep pace, and even go above, the rate of inflation.  We proposed proper public sector reform, an issue with which Fianna F&aacute;il is incapable of grasping and dealing.  The Government ratcheted up public sector expenditure in the past ten years by 150%.  Therein lies the issue that needs to be tackled.  Instead, the Government, seeking &euro;2 billion, will make it up with the Lenihan levy, some &euro;1 billion, and a raft of other measures which hit low and middle-income families.</P>
        <P>The payment of corporation tax has been pulled back by five months to balance the books.  Businesses are already under severe pressure with cashflows, yet the big arm of the Government puts more pressure on them with this measure.  I am very sure the Government will not be giving businesses much latitude in the payment.  Instead of paying it in November, companies will be expected to pay half of it in June.  This is to cover up the Government&rsquo;s mistakes and lack of proper reforms.</P>
        <P>There have been increases across all taxation areas &mdash; income tax, motor tax, capital gains tax and excise duties.  Last night, people in Limerick were queuing to fill up their car tanks because of the increase in the price of petrol.  People are under enough pressure.  Limerick has seen a 53% increase in its live register.  The budget has proposed nothing to correct this through proper re-training.</P><Col N="787"/>
        <P>A &euro;10 levy has been introduced on flights out of Shannon Airport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>It also affects Knock Airport and others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the flights out of Dublin Airport will only be taxed by &euro;2.  The only route on which the &euro;10 tax will not apply to Shannon is the Dublin one.  The Government bailed out of the Aer Lingus Shannon-Heathrow route and soon no Aer Lingus cabin crew will be based at the airport.  A punitive &euro;10 charge is being imposed on every passenger leaving Shannon Airport.  This must be reversed.  I put that to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, the only Minister in the mid-west.  He informed me the Minister for Finance would consider it until March.  However, I want the decision reversed with immediate effect.</P>
        <P>The Budget Statement did not refer to urban regeneration projects for Limerick city when they got great mention last year.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Finneran, is present and we need a commitment on this matter.  The people of Limerick were promised regeneration would be delivered .  It must be honoured by the Government.  We were informed the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, will reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the project and outline details on the level of funding and when it will be forthcoming.  The project is vital to the revitalisation of Limerick and those living in the proposed regeneration areas.  If it is not delivered, it will be a disaster for Limerick and the region.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has to say about regeneration.</P>
        <P>The Government is forever asking what Fine Gael would have done in this budget.  We have produced not one, but two policy documents, Recovery Through Reform, published last July, and our budget details last week.  We said we would not raise taxes.  The Government has done the opposite.  We said we would conduct proper public sector reform and cut &euro;1.8 billion from current expenditure.  The measures would be very straightforward.  There would be a cut in public sector pay for those earning over &euro;50,000 and a ban on all recruitment, apart from frontline services.  We wanted reform of the drugs scheme to be based on generic drugs.  We wanted &euro;1.5 billion to be sought from the banks for the State guarantee scheme.  The budget contained no mention of what charges will be imposed on the banks for the guarantees, yet it is based on taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
        <P>The Government is cutting back on the national development plan.  Fine Gael proposed to take &euro;1 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to keep the national development plan on course.  We proposed a carbon levy on electricity generators to raise &euro;300 million.  At least the Government took on board our proposal on capping pension relief, which we welcome.</P>
        <P>We proposed putting aside &euro;150 million for benefits for the vulnerable.  However, mortgage interest relief is being reduced for people not in their first homes from 20% to 15%.  I note no measures to assist people in trouble with mortgage repayments.  Fine Gael proposed to set aside &euro;15 million to help people through community welfare officers and MABS to get relief with mortgage repayments.  The Government increased the winter fuel allowance by 28% but we believed it should go up by 50% and proposed to set aside &euro;65 million for it as heating fuel costs have risen by 78%.</P>
        <P>There is nothing in the budget to deal with the unemployed.  Currently, one must be 12 months unemployed and in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to qualify for the back to education allowance.  We proposed that this time constraint be done away with for those in receipt of the benefit and the lower paid earning less than &euro;12 per hour.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s measures are practical, could stimulate the economy, would not raise taxes or suck the lifeblood out of the economy.</P><Col N="788"/>
        <P>Fine Gael also dealt with two matters the Government has avoided &mdash; the fee for the banks for the State guarantee scheme and proper public sector reform.  The Government, however, has fudged and not made the hard decisions on these issues.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, is present.  I want him to give me a commitment that he will reverse the decision on medical cards for the over 70s.  I presume he is aware that not only will the over 70s end up paying the 1% levy but, if they are receiving more than &euro;26,000 a year through an occupational pension, once their medical card goes, they will be paying another 2% in health contributions.  This means they will be paying a superlevy of 3%.  Not only is the Minister hitting them through an increase in the drug refund scheme and extra accident and emergency costs, but he is also fleecing them through income tax.  A person on an occupational pension of &euro;30,000 will now be hit with nearly &euro;1,000 extra per year in tax, apart from medical expenses.  That decision must be reversed.  If the Government does not do so, it will show how little it values people who have devoted their lives to building this economy.  How does the Minister value such people?  This matter is critical in terms of how the D&aacute;il is viewed by the public.  Does the Minister care?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>He could not care less.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does he care for people aged over 70 who are speaking on the Joe Duffy show and are telephoning us?  I have no doubt they are also ringing the Minister.  The measure will save a measly &euro;100 million, while the banks have been given a guarantee of &euro;500 billion.  This is not on and must be reversed.  The Minister should deal with this matter in his reply.  When this measure was first introduced in 2001, many elderly people relinquished their VHI cover and may now find it difficult to get cover with the VHI or other health service providers.  Even if they do, they will have to wait ten years before reaching the conditions they had before giving up their insurance.  The decision must be reversed because it is nothing short of disgraceful.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been an exceptionally challenging budget framed against difficult international economic circumstances.  We are duty bound to take action to put the public finances on a sound footing in the interests of all the citizens of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>

	<P>In doing this, the Government has not taken a short-term view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Very short term.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, the Minister is doing the opposite.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the Minister to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>All of these principles are clearly seen in the estimates for my own Department.  We have forensically examined all expenditure.  We have had to make difficult decisions, but I believe we made the right ones.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>How does the Minister define &ldquo;forensically&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>For example, we have concentrated housing expenditure on social housing and protecting the most vulnerable.  We are investing in environmental protection <Col N="790"/>concerning water, waste management and the natural and built heritage.  In addition, we have increased investment in the water services investment programme by a massive 19% in the interests of protecting public health, compliance with EU environment standards and supporting economic development.  I will return to these issues in greater detail later.</P>
        <P>Today, I am presenting the second annual carbon budget.  When I introduced the concept last year, I explained the thinking that led to its inclusion in the Agreed Programme for Government.  If climate change is to be central to Government policy-making, it must be integrated into the annual budgetary process.  Our decisions on expenditure and taxation must be informed as much by the climate impact as by the financial and economic impacts.</P>
        <P>Given the unprecedented financial backdrop to this year&rsquo;s budget, many might have expected climate considerations to receive little, if any, attention.  That would have been a huge mistake.  As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Leader of the Green Party, I have spoken in the House on many occasions about the environmental cost of our greenhouse gas emissions.  In the context of today&rsquo;s debate, however, the focus must also be on their financial and economic cost.  If we do not reduce our emissions, the long-term costs to the Exchequer and to the economy will be immense.</P>
        <P>While the international negotiations on a post-Kyoto agreement have not yet concluded, we already know that Ireland will be required to reduce its emissions by 2020 to a level at least 20% below that of 2005, and probably by considerably more.  As we stretch the time horizon towards 2050, the scientific consensus is that the cuts required of developed countries could be as much as 80% to 95%, if the worst effects of global warming are to be avoided.</P>
        <P>These cuts will not be optional.  They will be binding on Ireland under future EU and UN agreements and we will face hefty financial sanctions if we fail to meet them.  We must, therefore, prepare the ground now for a major structural change in our economy and our society, so we can continue to develop and prosper while simultaneously reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  The Government has accepted this reality and has agreed a budget that is designed not just to restore financial stability, but also to move us further towards the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy.</P>
        <P>I have circulated a short table which sets out the trend in Ireland&rsquo;s emissions, including the projections for the Kyoto period.  The table includes provisional estimates of 2007 emissions, which have just been completed by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The agency has done excellent work in completing its calculations two months earlier than planned.  There was speculation in some media a few weeks ago that our emissions would be substantially up on the previous year, but that is not the case.  The table shows a welcome fall of just over 1% in net emissions, taking account of increased sequestration though afforestation.  Net emissions have fallen from 68.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2006 to 67.9 million tonnes in 2007.  While the reduction in 2007 is welcome, it offers cold comfort in the context of the baseline trend for the Kyoto period.  Over the past year, the Government has committed significant resources to improving the capacity to model and project emissions across the various sectors.  This has enabled the EPA, with the support of relevant agencies in the various sectors, comprehensively to update projections for the Kyoto period, which were included in the national climate change strategy.</P>
        <P>This analysis shows that, even after allowing for the implementation of the measures that have already been put in place by the Government, the baseline trend continues to rise.  The most striking revision relates to transport emissions.  The average level for the Kyoto period is, in advance of new measures, put at close to 2 million tonnes a year more than was projected <Col N="791"/>last year.  The downward trend in agriculture has also been reversed, as livestock numbers have begun to rise again.</P>
        <P>There is a sizable fall in projected emissions in the residential sector, thanks in part to the energy efficiency measures that have been introduced in the past year, but this is overwhelmed by the baseline changes in transport and agriculture.  The consequence, as shown in column D of the table, is that the Government is, in advance of new measures, projected to have a gap of 5 million tonnes a year.  This must be bridged by a combination of further measures and purchasing credits under the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto protocol.</P>
        <P>The House is aware that, on coming into office last year, the Government established a Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security, chaired by the Taoiseach.  One of its main tasks has been to drive the cross-departmental effort to develop further measures to reduce emissions.  The wider public sector is also contributing to this effort.  Tomorrow, I will be speaking at a major conference on the way forward for local authorities in addressing climate change.</P>
        <P>As a result of the work of the Cabinet sub-committee, this year&rsquo;s Estimates and budget process have given greater priority than ever before on the need for emission reductions, notwithstanding the emphasis that has inevitably been placed on financial stability in the particular circumstances of the time.</P>
        <P>I now propose to draw together the key responses across various sectors.  Some will deliver emission reductions in the short to medium term, and these are reflected in columns E and F of the table.  However, the longer term is even more important.  Real structural change cannot be achieved overnight, but we need to put the drivers in place if we are to get the benefit in future.  Much of what I am outlining today will take time to deliver, including emission reductions, but in the long run they will have a significant effect.</P>
        <P>One of the most effective ways of reducing our national greenhouse gas emissions is to generate as much electricity as possible from renewable sources rather than from fossil fuels.  The previous Government adopted a target that 33% of electricity consumed would be from renewable sources by 2020.  Today I can confirm that the Government has agreed, on the recommendation of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, to increase this target to 40%.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />

      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the interim target?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The target is underpinned by analysis conducted in the recent all-island grid study which found that a 40% penetration is technically feasible, subject to upgrading our electricity grid and ensuring the development of flexible generating plant on the electricity system.  The study concludes that this higher level of renewable electricity would reduce our carbon emissions from electricity by 25% over the business-as-usual scenario, a saving of around 5 million tonnes.</P>
        <P>This work was further underpinned by the new electricity grid development strategy which was published by EirGrid last week.  The Government will be conducting further analysis to ensure that the higher renewable electricity target supports competitiveness, is delivered on time and at least cost to consumers and businesses, while maximising sustainable socio-economic benefits.</P>

	<P>The decision provides a clear and strong message from Government on its commitment to ensure secure, competitive and sustainable energy sources.</P><Col N="792"/>
        <P>I was also pleased to launch last week the stakeholder consultation paper that sets out the detailed implementation plan for the new energy efficiency standard for light bulbs and I want to record my appreciation of the support received from the lighting industry in finalising the measure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a bright spark.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Emission reductions in most sectors take time to achieve and transport is a case in point.  In the past, an over-emphasis was placed on road transport by Governments and the public, and the result is evident in our spiralling transport emissions.  However, the Government is shifting the emphasis towards public transport and is supporting and incentivising the behavioural change that will deliver a more sustainable transport future for all of us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is cutting back on public transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister read the budget?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The new emphasis has been seen clearly in this year&rsquo;s budget.  Despite the very difficult financial backdrop, key public transport projects are being continued to ensure continued enhancement of rail services&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a &euro;160 million cutback in services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly to support commuters, and increased priority is being given to buses in Dublin and other cities.  The critical strategic priorities in Transport 21, such as metro north and the DART interconnector, will go ahead.</P>
        <P>The commuting experience will be significantly improved through: the removal of pinch points on quality bus corridors and other bus routes, integrated ticketing using smart card technology and real-time passenger information at bus stops and on mobile phones.  Most people who stand at a bus stop experience the frustration of not knowing when the bus will come.  Having this information available by mobile phone will make a difference to the attractiveness of public transport.</P>
        <P>However, capital investment on its own is not enough.  The Government must also encourage significant behavioural change by providing a clear vision of a more sustainable transport future backed up by strong policies.  That vision and those policies will be set out in the sustainable travel and transport action plan, which will be published shortly by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, who earlier this morning made announcements about this.</P>
        <P>In association with that plan, the Minister will also be developing national cycling and walking strategies to encourage emission-free modes of travel.  The plan will set out to create a culture of walking and cycling, in particular, by ensuring that streets in urban areas are managed and designed so that we have safe and pleasant environments for pedestrians and cyclists.  Today I can confirm that the Minister and I will be providing a special cycling package for Dublin to the tune of &euro;5 million to include funding for work on the city centre portion of the proposed Sutton to Sandycove cycle route.  The Minister for Transport and I will also be providing funding to upgrade and maintain existing cycle routes in Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>What are the details of the tax relief package for cycling to work?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>In addition, my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, together with the Minister for Transport, will announce in the coming <Col N="793"/>weeks the development of a strategy to have up to 10% of our road transport fleet electrically powered by 2020.  The aim is that Ireland should be among the early movers in exploiting recent international advances in electric vehicle technologies, moving from advanced plug-in hybrid vehicles to full electric vehicles which have no direct CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.</P>
        <P>A particular advantage of this technology is that the vehicles are typically recharged at night, when the electricity system has its lowest load demand.  As we move towards increasing our renewable electricity generation, mainly by developing new wind capacity, electric vehicles would provide a useful market for night-time wind generation.</P>
        <P>The first full year in which the major taxes on cars are based solely on their emissions will be 2009.  This follows the introduction in last year&rsquo;s budget of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> based motor tax and VRT.  The early indications from the first three months of the new system are of a strong trend towards lower-emission vehicles.  Of the 42,000 cars which are now charged motor tax on the basis of emissions, 85% are in the three lowest bands.  The increases in motor tax, which I introduced last night, maintain the strong incentive in the system to switch to lower emission cars when purchasing new vehicles, with a higher rate of increase for cars above the 2.5 litre threshold and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> bands E, F and G, and no increase for electric vehicles.  I intend to keep the motor tax system under review, in consultation with the motor industry, to ensure that it meets the twin objectives of protecting local government funding while incentivising greener motoring in future years.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s vision for the transport sector involves major structural change.  This will take time to deliver and to make a significant impact on emissions.  In the shorter time period of our Kyoto target, my Department has estimated that the impact of the relevant fiscal and other measures in this budget on transport emissions will average 200,000 tonnes per annum over the 2008-12 period, and this is reflected in the carbon budget table.</P>
        <P>In terms of the role that we can expect from the residential sector in meeting our emissions reduction targets, I am determined that the public sector leads the way.  I am, therefore, announcing a number of initiatives today that provide a platform for significant progress in this area.</P>
        <P>Public housing in Ireland has a long record of achieving high quality by reference to the standards prevailing at the time of construction, but energy efficiency standards are now far higher than when much of our public housing stock was built.  Remedial works and regeneration programmes, undertaken by local authorities and funded by my Department, are delivering significant energy efficiency improvements in various locations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Fix the windows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but a more comprehensive programme of action is now required.</P>
        <P>A full audit of the public housing stock will begin in 2009 to lay the foundation for a programme of retrofitting, where required&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Delaying tactics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to deliver modern standards of energy efficiency.  In addition, in parallel with this audit, &euro;5 million will be provided next year to undertake a number of pilot retrofitting projects; the learning derived from these will play a major part in informing our approach to the wider roll-out of the programme, which will commence once the audit is completed.  Not only will the ultimate national roll-out of the programme contribute in a significant way to the achievement of reductions in carbon emissions, it will also yield a vital fuel poverty dividend.</P><Col N="794"/>
        <P>In addition to this essential need to deal with the legacy of the past, I am also determined that we look to the future and explore ways in which we can make greater progress on designing out the carbon impacts of new housing.  Much has been achieved already with dwellings now required to deliver 40% greater energy efficiency on the standards applicable in 2005 and we intend to bring the improvement on the 2005 position to 60% in 2010.  However, we now need to plan beyond that.  We need to push the boundaries of environmental performance of housing further towards the goal of achieving zero carbon emissions.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>To show further clear leadership on the part of the public sector, I have invited local authorities and voluntary/co-operative housing associations to submit proposals for the delivery of a number of demonstration projects in this area.  The aim of these will be to deliver sustainable energy efficient housing developments in which homes will reach a minimum A2 building energy rating.  Some &euro;10 million will be provided next year, and again in 2010, to support these demonstration projects, which will significantly advance the knowledge and experience base in the design, construction and use of high performing energy efficient housing and promote wider awareness of the technologies involved.</P>
        <P>I also very much welcome the additional funding provided in the budget for two schemes which are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The home energy saving scheme, introduced this year, provides grants to householders to improve the energy performance of their homes, while the warmer homes scheme provides energy efficiency improvements to lower-income households in the private sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Allocations of &euro;20 million have been made to the home energy saving scheme and &euro;10 million to the warmer homes scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has changed since he crossed the floor.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The measures I have outlined in the residential sector, which amount to an investment of &euro;45 million in the coming year, will support the achievement of the emission reduction targets which have already been set out in the Government&rsquo;s draft energy efficiency action plan and are, therefore, already quantified in the carbon budget table.</P>
        <P>Similarly, I am not separately quantifying the impact of the expansion of accelerated capital allowances for energy efficient equipment, which was announced by the Minister for Finance yesterday, but this will reinforce the drive towards greater efficiency and reduced emissions in the commercial and industrial sector.</P>
        <P>The importance of livestock-based agriculture and food production to Ireland&rsquo;s economy is unique within the EU.  The scale of the sector is such that it will be impossible to meet our <Col N="795"/>long-term greenhouse gas targets without significant emission reductions in agriculture.  We must find ways of achieving this without undermining the economy, food security and rural communities.  The Government is investing heavily in wide-ranging research on the potential for more efficient use of inputs, improved production systems and other emission-abatement measures.  The considerable effort we are now devoting to the promotion of organic farming will also result in lower emissions.  Similarly, promotion of biomass for energy will give multiple climate benefits.</P>
        <P>As in other sectors, most of the benefit will come in the longer term and will be more relevant to our 2020 target than to the Kyoto period.  However, the Department of Agriculture and Food has estimated emission reductions of 200,000 tonnes per annum on average in the 2008-12 period through new measures now being introduced, and this is reflected in the table I have circulated to Members.  These accrue mainly from organic farming and from increasing the length of the grazing season.</P>
        <P>The final two columns of the table show the adjustment to the projections for the Kyoto period as a result of the measures I have outlined.  It is important to note that the economic growth rates underlying the EPA projections are broadly similar to the ESRI&rsquo;s &ldquo;Benchmark&rdquo; forecast which was published in its Medium-Term Review: 2008-2015 last May.  It may well be the case that the projections now somewhat overstate the baseline trend for the Kyoto period, given economic developments since May.  They will be revised when new forecasts for medium-term economic growth are firmed up, and I expect some further reduction in the distance to target.  This also means that the requirement to purchase credits is likely to be somewhat less than the 4.6 million tonnes shown in column F of the table.</P>
        <P>I have made my position on carbon credits very clear on several occasions.  I recognise that the flexible mechanisms are an integral part of the Kyoto Protocol and I appreciate the value of promoting green investment, particularly in developing countries.  I do not have a difficulty availing of the flexible mechanisms to help meet our obligations in the short term, but with one major qualification.  We must not under any circumstances allow the availability of carbon credits to deflect us from taking the necessary actions to place us on a low carbon trajectory in the longer term.  Over-reliance on carbon credits in the future will be a millstone which will hold back our economic development and deny us the advantages which will flow from early-mover adoption of efficient technology in transport, energy production, agriculture and in our homes and workplaces.</P>
        <P>This year&rsquo;s carbon budget is a starting point but much more progress will be required in the coming year.  I particularly welcome confirmation by the Minister for Finance that an announcement on the carbon levy will be included in next year&rsquo;s budget, taking account of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation when it has reported.  The principle of carbon pricing is accepted by virtually all economists and analysts as the most effective way to secure emission reductions.  It is the basis of the EU&rsquo;s emission trading scheme which applies to the bigger emitters, such as power generators and industrial plants.  The carbon levy will enable us to harness its benefits in the rest of the economy and will deliver a further reduction which will be reflected in next year&rsquo;s carbon budget table.  Over the next year the Government will develop further measures to get to grips with the climate challenge, reduce our purchases of carbon credits and bring us on track for the annual average 3% reduction in emissions to which we are committed in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>We must also ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s economy adjusts to a low-carbon future. It is estimated that the green technology sector is now worth &euro;284 billion worldwide.  The European Commission estimates that eco-industry in Europe already employs more people than either car manufacturing or chemicals, and various reports have projected huge employment growth in <Col N="796"/>the years ahead.  Instead of merely taking technological developments from other countries, we have an opportunity to play a leading role in developing a green economy.  Some years ago we harnessed the State&rsquo;s industrial, educational, enterprise and development resources to develop biopharmaceutical and ICT sectors in Ireland, leading to significant inward investment and highly productive employment.  The Government intends to take a similar approach to the development of the green technology sector.  We have already made significant steps towards embracing this growth area but, to be effective, we must take a &ldquo;whole-of-Government&rdquo; approach.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the Government&rsquo;s Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security is examining how the green economy might best be fostered.  In the coming weeks a number of Ministers who have responsibility in the relevant areas will collectively announce the establishment of a high level action group to advise on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s green economy.  The group will report to Government within four months, setting out an action plan for developing green enterprise in Ireland with a view to contributing to economic growth and providing new, quality employment opportunities in this growing sector.  The group will be tasked with identifying the potential for enterprise development, how education and training might address skills deficits, necessary research and development and the potential for Irish firms to bid for public procurement opportunities throughout the EU.  We are determined to guide our economic development and well-being on to a sustainable and low carbon path.  By successfully developing a thriving green technology sector, we can look forward to making a significant contribution to emission reductions.</P>
        <P>The State already plays a direct role in the economic life of the country.  It directly purchases products and engages services through public procurement.  The Government is currently considering how our public service can give greater consideration to environmental impacts in its procurement arrangements.  This has the potential to play a significant role in giving an incentive to companies to improve their environmental performance, leading to reductions in emissions, and in assisting Irish companies in successful international public procurement competitions.</P>
        <P>I do not under estimate the scale of the environmental challenges we face, nor am I under any illusion about the uphill struggle we have in tackling our climate change emissions.  The modest steps we are taking, which are undoubtedly an improvement on what has gone before, will not be enough to achieve the type of emission reductions we require.  We must be much more radical.  The introduction of a carbon levy next year will be an important step, but it is only one step in what has to be a fundamental multi-faceted approach, involving all Departments.</P>
        <P>I have been campaigning on environmental issues for all of my adult life and I know what must be done.  We have very little time to do it.  It is worth making the effort even if it is at times frustrating.  I retain the hope that we can work together on these very important issues on a non-partisan basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is the Minister will have to listen to us as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputies have any ideas on this subject, I will listen to them any time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister open to questions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I will now comment on some specific aspects of my Department&rsquo;s Estimates.  I will concentrate on the principal sectors within my Department&rsquo;s broad remit.  In 2009, my Department will continue to advance the protection of our environment and ensure <Col N="797"/>compliance with EU standards with regard to water, waste and species protection.  My policies and programmes will be framed against the background of the state of the environment report, Ireland&rsquo;s Environment, published last week.  This is the most comprehensive and authoritative assessment of our environment available.</P>
        <P>The provision of &euro;560 million for 2009 is the highest ever for water services infrastructure, representing an increase of 19% over 2008.  Against the present economic backdrop this is the clearest possible statement by the Government of the priority we are giving to preserving and protecting our water resources as a key element of our environment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has no choice.  It has been forced to do it by the EU.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to meeting EU standards for drinking water and waste water treatment and to providing critical infrastructure that will ensure ongoing support for the economy.  Good quality water and waste water services are vital for housing, industrial and commercial development.  A recent Forf&aacute;s report helps to identify key locations where improved water services will be needed to capitalise on potential investment in new jobs and services in the future.  The record 2009 allocation means that the resources will be available to meet these challenges and to deal with the water services requirements of smaller towns and villages up and down the country.</P>
        <P>This Exchequer support for water services is backed up by the greatly improved supervisory structures I have put in place to ensure an optimum return from the investment, both in terms of service to the consumer and environmental protection.  I have provided the Environmental Protection Agency with the resources to ensure it can effectively carry out the new supervisory functions given to it under the drinking water regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister have money for the maintenance of these schemes?  That is the main issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The agency and local authority response to recent lead excesses in certain water supplies is evidence of the effectiveness of this new regime.  It also reminds us of the fundamental necessity to ensure that the quality of our drinking water supplies meets the highest standards.  In that context, I recently announced a wide range of additional measures to secure universal compliance with drinking water standards, including accelerated progress with key schemes and immediate remedial measures to respond to potential risks identified by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Drinking water quality data will also soon be available on local authority websites for everyone to see, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government.  On the waste water side, discharges from municipal sewage treatment plants are now subject to licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency to guarantee conformity with effluent standards and to protect the quality of the receiving waters.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency is central to our efforts to protect and enhance our environment.  The 2008 Exchequer provision for the agency of almost &euro;35 million, together with its income from licensing and the environment fund, positions it well to continue to carry out its very important environmental functions on our behalf.</P>
        <P>This year has seen major advances in the development of our built heritage programme.  In addition to providing ongoing support for the civic structures and architectural conservation grants schemes, I have also been in a position to progress new funding programmes such as the places of public worship fund and the INSTAR archaeological research fund.  The provision of more than &euro;25 million for built heritage in 2009 will consolidate the progress made during <Col N="798"/>2008.  Next year&rsquo;s allocation for the Heritage Council of more than &euro;11 million will allow the council to progress key initiatives such as the buildings-at-risk programme.</P>
        <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department is responsible for the provision of front-line services for the protection of nature.  It enforces habitat and species protection, in addition to providing expertise and advice to Departments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;landowners, farmers, local authorities and other stakeholders in regard to protecting sensitive sites and species.</P>
        <P>In 2008, I gave priority to work that will enable us to meet our obligations under the EU birds and habitats directives, through measures such as the reallocation of resources to high-priority areas and through putting in place pressing conservation initiatives.  This will remain my focus in 2009.  Substantial funding will continue to be made available for the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s wildlife and habitats, necessary research, surveying and monitoring, the bog compensation scheme and agri-environmental measures to protect specific habitats and species.</P>
        <P>However difficult the economic transition we are experiencing may be, there are certain priorities that must always remain at the top of the political agenda.  That is why, in the overall financial provision for housing in 2009, our focus is on utilising the very significant resources that will be available in a way that takes account of the needs of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in society.</P>
        <P>The total Exchequer provision for housing will be almost &euro;1.66 billion in current and capital finance.  By any measure, this is a very significant sum.  It will allow for the progress made in 2008, when the needs of almost 18,300 households were met through the broad range of social and affordable housing programmes, to be further built on.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Finneran, will soon announce details of an expansion of the existing local authority mortgage scheme.  It will be a targeted and time-limited initiative to reflect the fact that access to mortgage finance has perhaps become an even greater obstacle to house purchase for first-time buyers than affordability.</P>
        <P>The scheme has been carefully framed to offer a line of credit to households who have made the decision to enter the market at this time but who are unable to do so because of the credit crunch.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;facing local government over the coming years resulting from the downturn in the economic cycle.  In working together at central and local levels to deal responsibly with the current economic challenges, the same principles I outlined in regard to the Government&rsquo;s budgetary strategy apply.  Local authorities will work to ensure that they are in a good position to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the economy as it recovers during the period ahead.</P>
        <P>Local government has benefited greatly from the additional resources devoted to it in recent years and it is now on a considerably sounder financial footing.  Local authorities will spend well some &euro;11.5 billion in 2008 in both capital and current expenditure.  Even with the necessary adjustments arising from this budget, local authorities will still be very significant economic players locally and nationally.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The fiscal position of the Exchequer is extremely difficult.  We have had to examine carefully all spending lines and all potential revenue sources.  Expanding the revenue base of local authorities is a progressive step.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The announcement in yesterday&rsquo;s budget that a new charge is to be introduced for non-principal private residences represents a significant step in the expansion of that base.  What we have done is simple and equitable.  It will share the burden more broadly and serve us well for the future.</P>

	<P>The Government will cripple small business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>A charge of &euro;200 per annum is being introduced for all non-principal private residences.  It will be levied and collected by local authorities and, on a conservative estimate, will yield &euro;40 million per annum.  The revenue stream will be used to contribute to the Exchequer funding to local authorities for operational costs.  Liability for payment of the charge will lie with property owners and not with the occupiers.</P>
        <P>I intend to ask the Government to approve legislation to give effect to this measure in the near future so the charge can be applied from 2009 and the House will have an opportunity at that date to discuss its details.</P>
        <P>On the wider issue of local government reform, I have just concluded a process of public consultation on the reform options set out in the Green Paper.  I am very pleased with the wide range of responses received.  I am now considering those responses and am working, as a key priority, to finalise policy decisions in the Government&rsquo;s White Paper.</P>
        <P>The measures I have outlined show the Government has responded well in these difficult times by taking immediate action to protect the public finances while at the same time ensuring environmental and economic sustainability and protecting the most vulnerable in society.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>In spite of all the spin in recent weeks about protecting the vulnerable &mdash; we heard a great deal about this today &mdash; the budget is a blatant attempt to ensure that ordinary working people will bear the brunt of clearing up the mess the Government has made of the economy.</P>
        <P>The comments of the Minister for Finance yesterday to the effect that people should pull together and play their part according to their means are cynical in the extreme.  The hallmark of the economic boom of recent years has been inequality.  The past decade has seen most families working very hard just to survive.  Welfare recipients were just about keeping their heads above water while the elite and high rollers were facilitated in making millions of euro hand over fist.  These were the developers and landowners, bankers, financial institutions, auctioneers and professionals associated with buying and selling houses and lending money to people who could not afford to borrow it in many circumstances.  I refer to all those vested interests who are so close to Fianna F&aacute;il and who, when the going got tough, have been so well protected by that party.  In many ways, this is the real legacy of the former Taoiseach Bertie <Col N="801"/>Ahern and the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy.  This structural inequality is so deep-rooted that the junior partners in Government are either closing their eyes to its existence or have become so used to it they are not seeing it for what it is.</P>
        <P>The people who are protected in this budget, far from being the vulnerable, are those who have always been the friends of Fianna F&aacute;il and who have always done well out of budgets.  Over the past ten years, it has always been the rich who have got the lion&rsquo;s share in budgets.  This is exactly what occurred yesterday.  I refer to special protection, which has facilitated the creation of so many millionaires, through ensuring there is as little Government interference as possible, with the lightest kind of regulation possible and the lightest demands possible in terms of taxation.  That culture continues very clearly in the current budget.</P>
        <P>Far from everyone playing their part, the budget targets those on low and average incomes and scandalously expects them to bail out the Government.  Yet again, the rich, who have done so well out of the boom, are getting away with it when it comes to contributing to the recovery.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has a downright cheek to call ordinary people to patriotic action while he allows the rich to avoid all responsibility.  What about those high rollers showing some patriotism for a change?  Yet again, they have got away with it.</P>
        <P>The Government had many options available in regard to how it would balance the budget.  The fair thing would have been to ensure that those who could afford it most and who have done so well in the good times would contribute the lion&rsquo;s share.  The Taoiseach claimed this morning that the Government had no choice but to do what it did.  This is clearly untrue.  The Government had choices about where the axe would fall and it chose to spare the rich and instead inflict the cuts and pain on ordinary people.  Why should anybody be patriotic in the face of blatant unfairness and inequality?  Why did the Minister not seek patriotism from the very people who contributed to the economy&rsquo;s difficulties and who could afford to make sacrifices?</P>
        <P>There are many areas where significant savings could have been made which would not have hurt the poor, if only there was the political will to do so, and my party leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, has already referred to a number of these.  Lies are being peddled by Government representatives who say we had no choice but to do what we had to do because we had to balance the books.  There were clear choices for the Government but it opted to let better-off people off the hook in respect of their responsibilities and instead targeted those who can least afford to make the sacrifice.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight a few of the areas where the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and his colleagues could have directed their attention in preparation for this budget.  For example, they could have decided to do something about the high level of mortgage interest tax relief for landlords, which currently stands at over &euro;500 million.  While these people have done very well, have a steady income and in some cases own umpteen properties, the Government, through its policies, has decided to continue to facilitate them to become even better off.  Although the economy is in difficulty, it has been decided to leave landlords alone, as untouchables in regard to tax, and to allow them tax breaks of over &euro;500 million a year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We are charging them &euro;200 per property.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Contrast that with the treatment of people at the lower end of the scale &mdash; those in part-time jobs, in community employment or on training schemes &mdash; who the Government will now tax.  Almost 800,000 people who are currently outside the tax net will be brought into it while landlords are left outside with their perks.</P>
        <P>Another example of what the Government could have done is to have abolished tax relief for super private clinics.  If this had been done, &euro;1 billion would have been saved, which would <Col N="802"/>have removed the burden from people on welfare and low incomes, who the Government sacrificed through its actions yesterday.</P>
        <P>The Government could have done something about the extraordinary pension situation where extraordinarily generous tax reliefs are provided for those who have their own pension schemes.  I am not talking about ordinary workers on ordinary incomes but, again, about the high rollers and those who have self-administered schemes, who are facilitated in putting together funds of over &euro;5.5 million.  The high rollers are the untouchables when it comes to pensions.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Government made some move with regard to other pension products by putting a cap on the level of tax relief allowed for PRSAs and RACs.  However, why did the Minister not go further?  He could have reduced that cap to a level of &euro;100,000 so people with earnings of up to that amount, who are doing reasonably okay, could continue to make pension contributions.  However, there is no justification on any grounds for the State to subsidise people earning in excess of &euro;100,000 in their pension contributions.  If the Government had done this, if it had been bold in its decisions and if it had decided to be fair in the budget, it could have raised an extra &euro;287 million from that measure alone.</P>
        <P>There are of course other areas.  For example, the Minister could have decided to close the loophole that allows developers to avoid stamp duty on commercial property.  This would have brought in another &euro;250 million if the Government had the courage to do it and if it was driven by the principle of fairness.  Unfortunately, this was not the way chosen.  Clearly, the Government shied away from the difficult choices it should have made.  Instead of boasting about being brave and not shying away from choices, it absolutely shied away from the choices facing it.  It could have decided to target those who were better off, who have done very well in recent years and who could well afford to make sacrifices.  Instead, those people were left to their own devices.  The Government decided that those who have done very well, the rich, would become the untouchables and instead it took the soft option of targeting those on average incomes and on welfare.</P>
        <P>I want to comment about the appearance of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the news last night.  I could not believe it when I listened to his comments on the budget.  In that self-satisfied manner and style he has cultivated over the past year or so, he told people he was actually proud of this budget because it had protected welfare, education and health.  The Minister needs to wake up and see what is going on.  I do not know whether he is too busy pursuing his own agenda to see what other people have had to contend with in terms of the provisions of this budget but he clearly does not understand the extent of the cuts that have been introduced.</P>
        <P>For example, the social welfare budget is approximately &euro;1.5 billion more than the projected outturn for the current year.  However, when one considers the likely significant increase in the number of claims from those being made unemployed or redundant, and all of the additional payments for the back to school allowance, MABS and the other extras which will undoubtedly arise, far from there being an 8.3% increase in the social welfare budget, the real increase in the Department&rsquo;s budget is less than 5%.  In real terms, this breaks down into increases of between 3% and 3.3%.  In the context where there is a current projected rate of inflation of 4.3%, far from welfare recipients making any progress, they will not even stand still.  In real terms, they will be worse off next year than they are this year.  By any standards, that does not represent protection for those dependent on social welfare.</P>
        <P>Equally, I would tell the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to wake up and see what is happening with regard to health, where there is the loss of the automatic entitlement to the medical <Col N="803"/>card for those over 70, increased accident and emergency charges, the halving of tax relief on medical expenses, increases in hospital charges and long-stay charges and an increase in the threshold for the drugs refund scheme.  All of these measures will impose huge hardship on people on low incomes who have health problems.  There are many people in that category and they are the ones who will bear the brunt of the cuts announced in the budget.</P>
        <P>The same is true in regard to education.  What has happened on the education front is shameful.  At a time when we should recognise the importance of education and ensure people continue to receive good quality education so that we strive to reach European standards, the Minister has decided to increase the pupil-teacher ratio.  That is an extraordinary decision.  In the light of the campaigns that ran last year in that regard I hope the INTO will now give Fianna F&aacute;il its answer.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Funding has been reduced to primary and secondary schools that are already struggling just to pay electricity and cleaning bills.  School transport costs are up.  Registration fees are up by &euro;600.  On that front also I refer to the abolition of child benefit for 18 year old students because that will have a huge impact in terms of education.  I do not know if Ministers understand that some teenagers struggle to stay on in school because their families are poor.  The withdrawal of child benefit from 18 year old students who are in school would put enormous pressure on them at a time when they are already finding it difficult.  It is criminal to abolish child benefit for people in those circumstances.  We will reap the rewards of that downstream in terms of a higher level of school drop out.</P>
        <P>The changes in the budget have all the hallmarks of a Minister for Social and Family Affairs who has little interest in her portfolio and who cares even less.  Let us examine some of the things that are happening.  The introduction of the new employment levy means a pensioner with an occupational pension will be taxed on the part of his or her income that does not come from social welfare.  A pensioner with an income from an occupational pension of &euro;10,000 will have to pay &euro;100 in tax.  That claws back &euro;100 of the extra &euro;7 per week from his or her State pension.  The income of such pensioners will rise by a mere 1.2%.  That will go nowhere in terms of keeping abreast of the increases in the cost of living.</P>
        <P>A lone parent receiving a one-parent family payment and rent supplement who has a part-time job earning &euro;70 per week will lose from the budget.  While such a person will gain &euro;6.50 per week on his or her welfare payment, &euro;2 per week for one child and a possible &euro;2 on fuel allowance, he or she will have to hand back immediately &euro;5 in extra contributions to her rent supplement.  Out of a welfare increase of &euro;6.50 there is an immediate clawback leaving a net increase of &euro;1.50.  That is shameful.  The overall increase for such a person is 1.5%, which is nowhere near what is needed to keep pace with the cost of living.  Things get worse for lone parents with dependants aged over 18.  The measures announced to compensate for the loss of child benefit will not go anywhere near compensating such a person.  If one does the sums on that, one will see that those people, undoubtedly, will be worse off.</P>
        <P>Much of the detail of the budget did not come out yesterday.  One had to read the small print.  Having gone through the Budget Statement, the Labour Party has identified 30 new charges, stealth taxes, cuts and reductions in services that were included in the budget, which were largely kept hidden away in the small print.  We have called those the treacherous 30.  Those 30 treacherous cuts, individually and cumulatively, will have an extraordinarily negative impact on ordinary working families, people on average incomes and those dependent on welfare.  Those cuts are a shameful indictment of the kind of inequality pursued by the Government over many years and which continue in these hard times.  All of the cuts were specifically <Col N="804"/>chosen by the Government to balance the budget.  They are cuts that specifically target ordinary people.  They represent an extraordinary betrayal of trust and an abandonment of the weakest.  Far from protecting the vulnerable they force the vulnerable and those on average incomes to carry the can and bear the brunt of the mistakes made by the Government to bail it out while the rich get away with paying little in terms of contributing to sorting out the current mess.  By any standards this is a shameful budget and members of the Government should be ashamed of it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is quite amazing how the Minister for Finance could keep a straight face when he described the budget as a &ldquo;call to patriotic action&rdquo;.  Where were the calls to the wealthy to be patriotic during the Celtic tiger years?  Many of the so-called patriots, the tycoons and multi-millionaires who were pampered by the Government, are tax exiles who pose as great Irishmen and women when they are in this country but who hide their riches away in tax havens so they do not have to pay their fair share here.  For those who were not tax exiles there were massive tax breaks throughout the terms of office of Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments over the past decade.  The wealthy were allowed to avoid tax in a myriad of different ways while ordinary PAYE workers bore the burden, as they always have.  Property was God and Charlie McCreevy was the high priest, followed closely by the present Taoiseach in his years as Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>The tent at the Galway races has been folded up, but the fat cats have not gone away you know.  As in all recessions, wealth will be less conspicuous but the wealthy will still prosper while the mass of the people pay for the greed and mismanagement of the Ministers and their friends who wined and dined in that famous tent.  Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments and their friends, the property speculators and developers, the stock-brokers and the bankers, have created this massive economic mess.  Will they own up and pay the price?  Not at all.  It is the people who will be made to pay the price.  Yesterday the first instalments of that price were extracted in what can only be described as a shameful and disgraceful budget.  It is a budget of savage cuts in public services and widespread new charges and taxes that will penalise those on low to middle incomes.  Yet, the Minister urges us to be patriotic.  James Connolly wrote about patriotism: &ldquo;True patriotism seeks the welfare of each in the happiness of all, and is inconsistent with the selfish desire for worldly wealth which can only be gained by the exploitation of less favoured fellow-mortals.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The levy of 1% on incomes below &euro;100,000 per annum represents a significant increase in tax for the lowest paid.  Even those on incomes below the tax threshold, those who pay no income tax at present, will be hit with this levy.  It is totally regressive and inequitable.  The Government trumpeted the miserly half of 1% pay rise for the low paid in the recent social partnership agreement.  Now they have wiped it out and taken money away from the low paid.  The same low paid families will suffer disproportionately from VAT increases, health charge increases, the cut in child benefit for 18-year old children, the cut-off of child care supplement at five and half years of age and the whole range of other hidden charges and taxes arising from the budget.  That is on top of rising prices for food that are hitting poorer families hardest.</P>
        <P>On the very day of the budget one of the largest hospitals in the country, Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda, turned away emergency medical and surgical cases because its accident and emergency department could not cope.  Then we saw the minimal increase in the health budget for 2009, which is well below inflation and will lead to massive cutbacks across the health services.  I have no doubt people will suffer and die avoidable deaths as a result.</P>
        <P>Means testing for medical cards for older people are being reintroduced, another example of the totally incoherent health policy of the Government.  The automatic entitlement for the <Col N="805"/>over-70s was introduced with great fanfare and now it is being taken away, causing huge confusion, anger and distress to older people.  My D&aacute;il office and those of my colleagues and our party ard oifig have been receiving telephone calls all day from older people who are incensed by this decision.  Sinn F&eacute;in said when this scheme was introduced that if the principle of universal entitlement was accepted for the over 70s, it should be accepted for all, but now the Government has taken a further step away from the type of universal public health care that we desperately need.  At the same time people are being forced to pay higher charges for accident and emergency visits and for medicines.</P>
        <P>Even before this budget, the public health system was being hit hard by cuts.  Hospital services are being closed for weeks on end at the end of the year to stay within HSE budgets.  Home help hours have been cut.  In the north-east region there have been cuts in orthopaedic services and dermatology.  I learned yesterday that there is a five year waiting list for dermatology in Tallaght hospital.  Surgical beds at Dundalk are to be reduced from 32 to eight from next Monday.  The axe continues to fall on services at Monaghan General Hospital where all acute medical services are scheduled to transfer to Cavan General Hospital by the end of next month.</P>
        <P>During the summer two senior doctors were let go from Dundalk hospital, in Crumlin children&rsquo;s hospital there was a ward closure affecting children with cystic fibrosis, in Letterkenny General Hospital a 20-bed ward was closed for the summer and there was a scaling back of day services.  These are only some of the cuts.  I shudder to think of what awaits us in the public health services in 2009.  What now of the 2007 Green Party manifesto which said &ldquo;Access to appropriate health care is a basic human right&rdquo;?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Of course the fat cats will not be affected by these health cuts.  They will be able to avail of the private hospitals provided for them by the Government at taxpayers&rsquo; expense.  The cost to the Exchequer of tax breaks to developers of private hospitals rose from &euro;1.9 million in 2004 to &euro;10.6 million in 2006, which is information provided by the Minister for Health and Children.  The cost in 2006 alone would have funded more than 6,000 extra full medical cards for a year.</P>
        <P>The story is the same in education.  The rise in class sizes and the cut in teacher numbers is a disgrace.  Once again schools in less well-off areas will suffer most.</P>
        <P>There are no measures to address the massive child care deficit in this country.  As a result of the budget there will be fewer child care places and child care services here, already the most expensive in Europe, will rise even higher.  To rub salt in the wound, the Minister has cut off the early child care supplement at five and half years of age.</P>
        <P>It is a myth that spending on public services has been too high, a myth I want to blow out of the water.  Cutbacks in public services are totally unacceptable.  Before the budget we were already spending the third least on public services in the European Union, followed only by Estonia and Lithuania.</P>
        <P>We said in our budget submission in 2004 that public goods are worth financing.  They should not be treated as expendable and thus the most convenient place to cut.  Well managed short to medium-term investment will often yield medium to long-term savings as other direct and indirect costs are reduced.  The health service is the prime example of how cuts and underfunding, which were seen as short term, have had the unintended consequence of driving up costs and significantly reducing efficiency in the longer term.  Thus, value for money is complex, can only be accurately gauged in the medium to long term and cannot always be equated with spending less.  That is a lesson the Government refuses to learn and it is leaving a terrible legacy for the future.</P>
        <P>The budget is very bad news for the Border region also, apart from all the other issues, including the fact that we will suffer most from the cuts in health spending.  There is a major <Col N="806"/>question mark over the completion of the N2-A5 route realignment from Monaghan town to the Border, which includes the proposed bypass of Emyvale, and Monaghan military barracks is to close, removing another local source of social and economic activity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the past decade the inequalities in this economy have been repeatedly identified and analysed and positive policies have been promoted by the Combat Poverty Agency.  The budget, which will foster further inequality and poverty, is also the budget that has tried to gag the Combat Poverty Agency, a move I can only describe as breathtaking in its arrogance.  The future of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service has also been put in doubt, a service that will be needed more than ever after this budget.</P>
        <P>I emphasise what I said outside this Chamber.  This budget is a recipe for emigration and the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will be standing at the airport to take &euro;10 flight tax out of the emigrants&rsquo; pockets as they queue up to leave.  Sinn F&eacute;in rejects this budget as we reject the policies which fostered inequality, which led directly to this recession and which have now spawned this monstrous budget.  We will oppose the Government, defend public services and promote policies that will create employment and revive our economy based on sound foundations.  We will be here to challenge the Government to the end.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The backdrop to the budget is the serious financial situation that Ireland, like many countries, finds itself in.  The events of recent times are, to use a phrase used in a different context, quite bizarre.  Household names in banking have gone under.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government should go under.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In the first instance, the Government had to secure the stability of the banking system, which is fundamental to the operation of the country.  Against the economic backdrop that the Government faced, its priority was to secure the economic and social future of the country.  This was foremost in our minds in all we did in framing the budget.  The Government wished to ensure that where choices were made it protected, as far as it could, those most vulnerable in society.</P>
        <P>I heard reference to health spending, which has increased in Ireland in the past ten years by, on average, 8.8%, the second highest among OECD countries.  Health spending in Ireland today accounts for 9% of national income, which is on a par with OECD countries, even though 11% of the population is over 65 years, whereas in the UK the figure is 18% and in some other European countries it is more than 20%.</P>
        <P>We have a substantial base of funding of the public health system.  The challenge is not merely to invest more funds as they become available, but to reform the manner in which we provide services, which has been the focus of much of what we have done in recent years.  In particular, we must ensure we provide services that are quality assured and driven by patient safety.  Nowhere is that more important than the area of cancer care.  The outcomes for cancer treatment in Ireland are not as good as in other European countries, with the exception of the treatment of children&rsquo;s cancer, in which we are top of the class worldwide.  The reason we do so well in the treatment of children&rsquo;s cancer is that we have centralised the treatment in one hospital, even though patients can receive services in 16 different places throughout the country.  The diagnosis, initial surgery and treatment are planned at one designated centre.  We see significant benefits from this system with the outcomes and we seek the same for the treatment of other cancers.</P><Col N="807"/>
        <P>The Government faced spending choices between, for example, more investment in cancer services to ensure the eight designated centres will be in place as quickly as possible and other choices.  All breast cancer services will be moved into the new centres by March of next year.  During next year, Professor Tom Keane will be involved in moving prostate and lung cancer, the next two priority areas, into the eight centres.  Professor Keane sought funding to assist with the transition of the services and to recruit the expertise we need to provide multi-disciplinary teams of physicians in the eight cancer treatment centres, including pathologists, radiologists, surgeons, medical oncologists and so on.</P>
        <P>The Government has approximately &euro;454 million available in extra funding for health next year.  This amounts to 3.2% year on year and when the once off payments during 2008 are factored out, such as the long-stay repayments, the figure is 4.2%.  Inflation is forecast to be 2.5% next year.  The position is not the same as it was in 1987 and 1988 when the Government reduced spending on health by 3.5%.  Faced with these choices, the Government decided to invest in the eight cancer treatment centres for next year and to invest in the fair deal.  There is more than 20,000 older people in long-term care.  Approximately half of those are in publicly funded facilities and have 90% of their care costs met by the State.  Those not in that situation have approximately 40% of their costs paid for by the State.  That is unfair and inequitable and places a heavy burden on the older person and his or her family.  It causes great distress to many older people who have had to sell their houses or whose children have had to remortgage their houses to pay for their parents&rsquo; care.  That is why the fair deal is so important.  It will ensure, for the first time, that those in publicly funded long-stay facilities and those in privately funded facilities are treated equally.  It will greatly relieve the stress older people and their families associate with going into long-term care.</P>
        <P>There has been a great deal of debate about medical cards.  There are 350,000 people over the age of 70 in Ireland.  Approximately 215,000, or 60%, of them have a medical card based on an assessment of means.  They will not be affected by the decision that was announced yesterday.  The other 40% of this country&rsquo;s over-70s &mdash; some 140,000 people &mdash; have a medical card not on the basis of their means but on the basis of their age.  We estimate that 14,000 or 15,000 people from within this group will get a full medical card when means tests are carried out.  A further 30,000 or 35,000 people will get a doctor-only medical card.  That will mean that 80% of people over the age of 70 will not have to pay to go to the doctor.  Of the approximately 70,000 people not in this category, those who earn less than &euro;650 a week, or &euro;1,300 a week for a couple, will be able to avail of a health support payment of &euro;400 for an individual, or &euro;800 for a couple, to meet the cost of going to the doctor.  Approximately 5% of those over the age of 70 will be outside the limit threshold and will not get any support.</P>
        <P>When we considered our options, we decided to prioritise the need to invest in cancer care and the fair deal.  We are focusing on the recruitment of approximately 120 speech and language therapists for children with special needs who have been assessed as being in need of such services.  We are helping the 53,000 families at the bottom of our society that avail of home help services.  We are assisting the 10,000 older people who receive home care packages and medical support in their own homes.  Such packages prevent them from having to go into long-term care.  The decisions we had to make were not easy.  I believe we made appropriate choices, in light of the resources available.</P>
        <P>I remind those over the age of 70 who do not get a full medical card, or a doctor-only card, that they are eligible to apply for a hardship medical card.  Some 70,000 people currently receive the benefit of that card.  It is given to individuals on the basis of their circumstances.  The hardship medical card helps people with particular illnesses or ongoing health requirements, for example.  As a result of this flexible approach, 70,000 people currently avail of the hardship medical card.  It will continue to be available to people over the age of 70.</P><Col N="808"/>
        <P>Reference was made in the House this morning to the VHI.  The VHI has informed me that contrary to what Deputy Gilmore said, there is no evidence that people over the age of 70 stopped subscribing to the VHI, to any great extent, when the over-70s medical card was introduced.  The VHI has said that the proportion of its clients who are over the age of 70 has increased from 5.5% to 6.5% in recent years.  The fact that a higher percentage of older people now have health insurance contradicts what Deputy Gilmore said in the House.  There is no cross-over between the services available under the medical card and those offered by the VHI in 2001 and 2002.  As the Taoiseach said this morning, the services in question were hospital-based.  The only expense covered by both the VHI and the medical card was the inpatient charge, which one pays for a maximum of ten days when one is in hospital.  If one has a medical card, one does not pay that charge.  The VHI has told me that if anyone wishes to return to its plan P, to which approximately 25,000 people currently subscribe, they will not be subject to any kind of waiting period.  It is important to clarify that the suggestion made by Deputy Gilmore this morning was incorrect.</P>
        <P>The increase in the accident and emergency charge is one of the other health service issues mentioned during the course of today&rsquo;s debate.  The increase will raise about &euro;10 million per annum, which is a small amount when compared to the overall level of expenditure.  It is obvious that medical card holders do not pay the charge.  The purpose of the increase is to encourage many of those who come to accident and emergency departments for relatively minor matters to contact their general practitioners in the first instance.  Those who are treated by GPs do not have to pay the accident and emergency charge.  As I have said previously, Ireland enjoys very good working-day and out-of-hours general practitioner services.  There is evidence in Ireland, unlike many other countries, to suggest that many of those who attend accident and emergency units would be better served by first going to general practitioners, who can deal with between 90% and 95% of our health needs.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about the charge for private beds in public facilities.  It has long been Government policy that the taxpayer should not have to fund, or subsidise heavily, private beds in publicly funded facilities.  Such facilities were paid for by the public purse and their staff are paid from the public purse.  As insured patients have preferential access to private beds in public facilities, it is not unreasonable that the taxpayer should not be asked to subsidise such beds heavily.  That is why we have been increasing the charge for such beds to private insurers over recent years.  The charge is being increased by 20% this year.  That will add 4% to the cost of private health insurance.  Beds that are not available to everybody on the same basis cannot be heavily subsidised by the taxpayer.  I do not believe anybody would regard that as being fair.  The increase in the charge for long-stay care, which was mentioned in the House earlier, is in line with the increase in pensions over recent years.</P>
        <P>The fundamental challenges this country faces are to restore the public finances and to protect employment as quickly as possible.  If we do not succeed, this country&rsquo;s future challenges will be much greater than those we currently face.  We need to prioritise the challenges I have mentioned.  Fine Gael has suggested the Government did not go far enough with its proposals to reduce public spending.  Deputy Bruton suggested health spending should be cut by a further &euro;700 million next year.  Quite honestly, I do not see how we could take such a level of funding away from the public health services in 2009.</P>

	<P>The option of firing 10,000, 12,000 or 14,000 public servants is not open to us.  I have said previously that I favour a redundancy plan that is based on a full <Col N="809"/>analysis and assessment.  In the past, we have had redundancy plans which were not based on a full analysis.  If people are superfluous to requirements in one area, while shortages exist in another area, of course that will be dealt with in the context of the announcement made yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  That has to be done on a planned voluntary basis.  That is what will happen.  Contrary to the myth that most of the new employees who have been recruited by the health service over the last three years are administrators, managers and other bureaucratic officials, over 80% of them are clinical personnel, such as doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and medical social workers.</P>
        <P>I said at the outset I wanted to share time with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  Before I give way to him, I wish to repeat that difficult decisions have to be made in the circumstances we currently face.  When we make difficult choices, we have to ensure we stay in contact with those who are most affected by them.  A helpline is available to the 140,000 people over the age of 70 who have an age-based medical card.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>They will not pay the health levy, as I said yesterday.  I think the Deputy was at the press conference at which I made that clear.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has indicated that the health levy will not apply to people over the age of 70.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I wish to make clear that the higher tax benefit at the marginal rate of tax, 41%, will apply to nursing home charges.  That benefit will not be eliminated until the fair deal is in operation.  When the fair deal is in operation, it would not be unreasonable to bring the tax benefit down to the standard rate of tax, in line with all other medical expenses, voluntary health insurance and mortgage interest relief etc.  Those who have examined the Irish tax system from an equity point of view have said all citizens should be treated equally.  Those who earn the most money should not get preferential treatment in the tax system, as far as benefits of this nature are concerned.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said the fat cats are getting too much.  He went on to say everybody should be able to avail of universal benefits.  That does not make sense.  At a time when tough choices have to be made, we need to ensure we protect those most in need.  That is what we sought to do in the health Estimates adopted by the Government for 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister for Finance has underlined, there has been substantial investment in public services over the past ten years.  This has made possible the very real improvements which have occurred in communities throughout the country.  In facing up to the changed fiscal circumstances, we should not lose sight of the strong base from which we are operating.  The range and depth of our public services would be the envy of many societies and contrasts dramatically with where we stood ten years ago.  In the justice and equality sector, we have been able to increase resources by 8 to 10% per annum over the past four to five years.  By any yardstick, this has been an unprecedented increase in the resources devoted to combating crime and addressing inequality.</P>
        <P>The changed financial circumstances are such that this level of increase is simply no longer possible across the board.  Against that backdrop, we need to renew our focus on driving value for money throughout the system, to pare back unnecessary administration or duplication and to focus on areas of greatest priority.  That is what I have tried to do.  Our greatest priority is the fight against crime.  We need to secure the effective capacity of the organisations at the heart of that effort.  That is why I have put the money where it should be.  That is the choice I made, and I make no apology for it.  I firmly believe that the communities we serve would expect nothing less.  To govern is to make choices, to identity priorities and to implement those rational choices.  In short, the funding is following the priorities.</P>
        <P>The resources provided for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2009 will make possible an increase in the attested strength of the force to almost 14,900, which is a full increase of 2,500 since the end of 2004.  It is an increase of about 700 on this year.  Notwithstanding the necessary restriction in public sector numbers generally, it is our intention to take on 400 new garda recruits during 2009, in addition to the almost 1,100 already in training.  An easy option would have been to freeze recruitment, as Fine Gael did when last in Government with the Labour Party, and to compensate by increasing overtime expenditure.  I rejected that option.  Instead, the Government has taken a strategic view that a more desirable and sustainable approach is to build up the basic capacity and strength of the force.  I am convinced that this is the right option and will be seen as such by communities who rightly demand an increase in visible policing in their neighbourhood areas.</P>
        <P>While we have reduced the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na overtime budget, a substantial allocation of &euro;80 million &mdash; or 4.6 million overtime hours &mdash; is being retained.  Crucially, &euro;21 million is being <Col N="811"/>ring-fenced for Operation Anvil.  This will make it possible to continue with a wide range of intensive policing activity, with a particular emphasis on tackling organised gangland crime.  There is no question of the Government going soft on the godfathers of crime and this level of ring-fenced funding is a clear indication of our steely resolve.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are a number of Garda ICT projects to be rolled out, including the national digital radio service and a new major case investigations system.  We are also providing &euro;10 million to begin outsourcing the safety and speed cameras in line with the road safety strategy, and 600 of these cameras will be rolled out by the middle of next year.  The budget for the Criminal Assets Bureau is up 20% and an overall allocation of &euro;18 million is being made for State forensic and pathology services.  The best possible technical and forensic insight to detect and prosecute crime is essential.  This funding package supports the new legislation that I will be bringing forward in the not too distant future.</P>
        <P>As I am sharing time, I will leave it at that.  Now that Deputy Flanagan is here, I must ask how he can ask for a 3% cut in spending on top of freezing Exchequer funding at 2008 levels and then ask for more resources for the Garda out of the other side of his mouth?  That is what he is at.</P>

	<P>In what was undoubtedly going to be a very difficult budget, one of the priorities was to make sure that spending increases would be possible in social welfare, health and education.  While the increases may not have been what the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, had hoped for in their Departments, it was important for the Government to give a signal that those were the areas in which we wanted to prioritise any spending increases.  Other Ministers, including myself, have to do whatever we can to make cuts in spending to try to facilitate that protection of crucial social services for our people.</P>
        <P>Our Department exceeded our targeted cut in the administrative area.  The overall current and capital spending reduction was around 7%.  While that is not something we welcome, we now have the opportunity to provide economic development and good fiscal management.  It was right for the Department to manage that reduction and to look for efficiencies in order to deliver the same level of service, while cutting our overall Vote at the same time.  Around &euro;366 million has been provided for the current side, although much of that includes money which is being transferred through the account, such as television licence fees.  On the capital side, &euro;134 million has been provided for.  This still allows us to provide an important stimulus package to several crucial industrial areas in the development of our economy.  I would  hope that the capital amount would be augmented by a certain amount of carryover from budget overruns in sections that do not use their full allocation.  That will help us in meeting our key projections for 2009.</P>
        <P>Our own payroll budget is slightly out of line, but this is because we have had a transfer of resources from other Departments.  We have taken on responsibilities that were previously in the Department of the Taoiseach.  The overall administrative budget decreases by 8%. This will put pressure on the Department to manage its affairs in a way that delivers real efficiencies.  The State agencies that are tasked with delivering many of the projects will find it difficult <Col N="812"/>because of the tightness on the current expenditure side.  However, I believe they can do it.  In this respect, the Government made a strategic decision that it was better to proceed with a development of a single national fisheries authority, maintaining our regional offices and structures, but not the regional boards as they currently exist.  That strategic decision is one for which I will have to legislate in the establishment of a new national fisheries authority.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc18- ?>One of the areas in which our Department has real potential to help us all through these difficult times is to stimulate new economic development and create new jobs.  We cannot concentrate on the contraction or management of financial resources alone.  We must develop a new economy which delivers new jobs and new revenue to pay for the social services that will be needed in future years.  This is our central role.  I regard my Ministry as a crucial economic development Ministry and I see a potential to develop new economies, particularly in the area of energy and broadband services.  In that regard I was pleased that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, was able to announce the Cabinet decision to increase the target we are setting for development of renewable electricity as outlined in this year&rsquo;s publication of the all-island grid study.  It behoves all State agencies, the regulator, the sustainable energy office and other Departments to row in on a co-ordinated approach to meet those targets.  The difficult economic climate and credit crisis will make it difficult to allow for capital allocations and capital spending in this area.  We are facing difficulties and a significant challenge but I am committed to rising to this challenge to create new jobs in the energy industries and to provide cheaper and cleaner electricity to power our economy.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>I am pleased that funding of &euro;71 million has been made available to fund sustainable energy and energy research programmes.  Sustainable Energy Ireland will be the key agency.  I hope to strengthen its resources and its operational structures to allow it to deliver an ever-expanding budget.  The agency has been in existence for five or six years but it needs to have strengthened structures in recognition of its increased workload.  The home energy savings scheme was launched last year on a pilot basis and it appears to be proving very successful.  It is very popular in the areas of the country where it has been introduced.  It has been very successful in economic terms as the analysis shows that energy efficiency, in particular insulation of existing buildings, gives the quickest and best economic return.  There is a return to the State in terms of lower emissions and lower fuel use but also a return to the householder in terms of cutting back household bills at a time when gas and electricity prices are very high.  I am looking forward to expanding that programme and to running it in conjunction with a rapidly expanding warmer homes scheme.</P>
        <P>We will seek an innovative approach from the public utilities to assist in the delivery of energy saving measures to low income households so that they can cut back on their bills.  This has to be taken in tandem with the work being carried out by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Minister at that Department, Deputy Mary Hanafin, in the area of fuel poverty.  We wish to help people not only in fiscal terms but also to reduce their use of electricity which is the best long-term solution to the issue of fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s other key development in the energy area will be publication of and action taken on the national energy efficiency action plan.  Particular attention will be focused by my Department, with my colleagues in other Departments, on how the State can achieve real savings in our classrooms, hospitals, prisons and Garda stations.  We must lead in the efforts to save money for the State.  The investment in energy insulation and efficiencies within our offices and Departments is one of the best ways of delivering efficiencies.  This public sector programme, in which I hope Sustainable Energy Ireland will take a lead role, will be crucial.  I will be working with my Government colleagues to see what real programmes can be delivered collectively to reduce our energy use.</P><Col N="813"/>
        <P>I refer to continuing investment in expansion in new areas.  The ocean energy unit was successfully established in Sustainable Energy Ireland this year.  As part of the ten-year plan set up a number of years ago, this unit must move into the launch of prototype devices and we must expand into new areas.  I appreciate the Minister for Finance has seen the sense of the capital tax supports available for businesses to help them in that regard.</P>
        <P>The key developments in the communications area will be the delivery of our national broadband scheme and of high speed broadband to secondary schools to allow students in those schools to avail of the fastest broadband speed.  I refer to the continuing work of the national digital research agency in developing Ireland as a real centre for the global knowledge economy.</P>
        <P>Given the current spending restrictions, it will be difficult to deliver in other core areas of my responsibility.  However, key projects such as the remediation of existing mine sites, the seabed survey, the provision of TG4 and the fisheries boards will continue to be provided for and are a crucial part of the work to be undertaken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Simon Coveney.  </P>
        <P>This is a very important debate on the budget which has placed the most difficult tax burden on the people of Ireland since the foundation of the State.  The Fianna F&aacute;il part of the Government and what is left of the Progressive Democrats part of it have been in power for more than 11 years.  They have been managing the affairs of the State for many years and they had prior knowledge of our economic situation but refused to act earlier.  They went into a massive post-election spend which continued despite the gathering of economic storm clouds.  They cannot escape the fact that under their leadership the economy has become less competitive and less efficient and that jobs are being lost left, right and centre as a result of Government policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There should have been no cutback on capital expenditure on transport.  A well functioning, efficient and competitive transport system is the key to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  The World Economic Forum competitiveness report published last week listed inadequate infrastructure as the most problematic factor for those doing business in Ireland.  It does not make sense to cut back on expenditure on transport infrastructure.  The quality of our transport infrastructure has dropped a number of places over the past year.  Ireland dropped from 55th place in 2007 to 64th  in 2008 out of 134 nations in the quality of overall infrastructure.  The quality of roads has dropped ten places to 70, air transport infrastructure has dropped to 46th place and port infrastructure has remained unchanged at 64th place.  If we want to make an economic recovery we must continue to invest in transport infrastructure.  The cutbacks in this transport programme are unacceptable to everyone.</P>
        <P>A number of significant key Transport 21 projects will be delayed.  The target of 2015 for the delivery of these programmes is in doubt.  We know that some of them will not be constructed.  The Government must ensure that the objectives of increasing our competitiveness can only be met by an improvement in transport infrastructure.</P>
        <P>I wish to respond to some of the issues raised in today&rsquo;s debate.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated that Deputy Bruton has been making a claim which I know he never made.  I refer to the words of Deputy Bruton when he dismissed absolutely and utterly the claims by the Minister for Health and Children.  It seems the Minister has neither mandate nor party at this stage and she is lecturing us about our economic policies.  The Minister for Health and Children has repeatedly claimed that Deputy Bruton wants to cut the health budget by &euro;700 million and she equates this to the closure of three hospitals or the sacking of 10,000 people.  However, that is false.  What Deputy Bruton said, and Fine Gael repeats, is that we would not have sanctioned the increases of &euro;224 million in the HSE pay bill, including the <Col N="814"/>massive bonuses and perks for the underperforming HSE managers.  Unlike the Government, Fine Gael would have delivered savings in the national drugs and pharmacy Bill by allowing pharmacists to substitute generic drugs for their branded equivalents.  Fine Gael would have set out a concrete and specific plan to cut the number of administrators in the HSE who have been effectively redundant for four years since the amalgamation of the old health boards.  Fine Gael reforms would not impact on front line services.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Harney and the rest of the motley crew in Government have visited on the elderly of this country a most disgraceful and shameful withdrawal of rights they were given.  Some years ago I was walking down a street in New York and noticed a number of senior citizens in ragged clothes begging on the streets.  I thanked God that would not happen in our country because we value our senior citizens and give them a place of honour in our society which we will not take from them.  That is not the case today under the Minister, Deputy Harney, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party in coalition.</P>
        <P>What price has the Green Party paid for its carbon budget?  What price are the elderly paying?  Some 125,000 senior citizens aged over 70 will have their medical cards reviewed.  Some 125,000 visits to homes, hospitals or nursing homes will have to be made by community welfare officers who will ask the sick and elderly what income and property they have and determine whether they are entitled to the benefit of the medical card, which most of them have had for at least seven years.  That means the youngest of those who received the medical card seven years ago are aged 77.  People in their late 70s, 80s, 90s and, please God, some who have lived to 100 years of age will be means tested.  Many are seriously ill, extremely worried, suffer from Alzheimer&rsquo;s or cannot even talk.  This is what the Government is doing to them and it is an appalling, shameful and disgraceful way to act.</P>
        <P>The mark of a just and caring society is how it treats those who are coming into the world &mdash; the young &mdash; and those who are leaving it &mdash; our elderly who are seriously ill or are, unfortunately, heading that way, as we all, eventually, will.  This is an important milestone in our society, that the Government is targeting the most vulnerable for these cuts.  It is inexcusable.  The older people who are ringing my office, and those of the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Devins &mdash; if the Minister, Deputy Harney, has any staff left &mdash; are saying they will not wear it, they do not want it and that it is unacceptable.  The Minister can say what she likes about the numbers of people, the 15,000 here and 20,000 there, but every old person is angry and extremely concerned about their future when we should be giving them the place of honour in our society to which they are entitled.  They have paid their dues and taxes, reared their families, and the Government is robbing them.  I do not know how to describe the Government.  It is like Scrooge, taking money from the pockets of the poor elderly people of our society.  It is an unacceptable, disgraceful and shameful situation.</P>
        <P>That leaves us with this budget which takes &euro;2 billion from the pockets of our taxpayers and the people over 70 who have pensions.  It is easy for the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, to smirk and smile, but those people are sitting in their homes saying they were not paying tax last week but from 1 January they will pay the 1% levy.  The Government is taxing those incomes again.  Elderly people tend to worry a lot.  We all know that, and the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, has a medical background.  Elderly people would be very concerned about this and worry disproportionately.  The impact on them will be much more severe than on younger and more able people.  This must be reconsidered.</P>
        <P>One of the points made about this benefit was that it was done in such a way that the medical doctors put a gun to taxpayers&rsquo; heads and charged &euro;600 per medical card for over 70s.  A far better way of tackling this issue would have been to tell the doctors this is not good enough <Col N="815"/>and it is costing too much, demand a reduction and negotiate those fees back down.  That would have been an acceptable starting point.  What the Government has done is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The rhetoric from the Green Party is sad because its proposal contained many good points, but also many poor elements, with which Deputy Coveney will deal in a moment.  I will deal with the transport issues to which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, referred.  He spoke about what they will do in transport, specifically the removal of pinch points on the quality bus corridors, integrated ticketing and real time passenger information at bus stops and mobile telephones.  He said: &ldquo;Most people who stand at a bus stop know the frustration of not knowing when the bus will come.&rdquo;  Dozens of buses were on the road between Dublin and Lucan and Celbridge for many years but are not coming any more.  They were run by the private Circle Line.  There was a very good system in place but unfair competition from the taxpayer-subsidised Dublin Bus put Circle Line out of business.</P>
        <P>Under the Green Minister we had convoys of buses, three Dublin Bus buses in front of a Circle Line bus, three after it and three waiting at the bus stop, all by virtue of the wealth we give Dublin Bus to run an inefficient and dominant system.  The quotes in the Minister&rsquo;s office make it clear that it has abused it dominant position in the marketplace to put out of business decent and honourable people who ran a very good bus service.  It does not matter whether a Dublin Bus or a Circle Line bus comes as long as a bus comes, but if the Government does not open the bus market in Dublin to competition, the buses for which people wait will not be provided because of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.</P>
        <P>All the big ideas are there.  If we have buses on the streets of Dublin we can provide people with the routes, but the Minister and the Government are prisoners of Dublin Bus and the unions.  They are afraid to open the market, afraid to have competition, and the commuter suffers most of all.  I challenge the Green Party to provide the buses.  I challenge it to have the guts to stand up to Fianna F&aacute;il, Dublin Bus and all the vested interests that are stopping people having a real choice.</P>
        <P>The cuts in transport are severe and serious.  Public transport is down 5% and roads are down 7%.  Road safety is a critical issue but by way of thanks for the good work done by the Road Safety Authority, its budget is being cut by 9%.  Regional airports are being cut by &euro;13 million.  Rural roads are being cut.  It goes on and on.  This is a shameful, disgraceful Government that has no guts and did not tell the truth when it could have, before the last election and immediately after it, and did not act when it could have and when it knew it had to during the summer.  The Government has acted too late, tackled the wrong people and focused on those who are weakest and least able to fight.  Even their health is being taken from them.  As was said about former Minister Ernest Blythe in the 1930s, people will remember this budget for a long time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of this opportunity to speak and I thank my colleague for a few extra minutes.  I want first to make some general comments on the budget.  I struggle to understand the Government&rsquo;s logic in what it is trying to do in this budget.  Surely the primary objective in a budget in a time of real difficulty and crisis is to try to address the cause of that crisis.  Surely the primary objective in a budget is to try to address the problem which has led us into this position.  Despite the fact that Minister after Minister stands up and makes the direct link between the credit crunch, the banking crisis, world economic woes and the recession in Ireland, other European countries which face the same conditions are not in recession and are certainly not in the kind of debt to which we are signing up this year.  We are borrowing &euro;13 billion to stay afloat this year, for a country that spends just over &euro;50 billion per year on <Col N="816"/>current expenditure.  The Government is far too expensive and we can no longer afford it.  What did the Government do to address that issue?  It increased current expenditure by 3.5% and slashed key capital expenditure that could have ensured future prosperity in Ireland in terms of driving innovation and competitiveness and stimulating economic activity.  The Government is going to pay for the excess expenditure by taxing people at every turn.  Whether one is a parent putting one&rsquo;s child on a school bus, a worker parking at one&rsquo;s place of work, buying petrol or going to hospital, one is charged at every turn.  </P>
        <P>We have heard a lot of nonsense from the Government that this budget is primarily about protecting the weak, that is, those on low incomes.  Can the Government explain how increasing the VAT rate or introducing a 1% levy on all income, no matter how small, except social welfare payments, protects people on low incomes and those who are struggling?  How does imposing an air travel tax on families who save up to go on holidays protect families on low incomes?</P>
        <P>This is a budget that has no new thinking behind it.  It is about a Government bailing itself out for its irresponsible over-spending on the back of a construction boom that could not last forever.  Where is the new thinking in this so-called radical budget?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a patriotic budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government built it up for weeks beforehand.  It was brought forward by seven or eight weeks.  We were expecting some new initiatives or ideas yesterday that would give people hope that the Government was doing something definite to create jobs and slow down the unemployment snowball that is growing by the week.  However, none of that is here.  Instead, the Government is damaging economic activity.  This budget will reduce what people spend.  They will have less money in their pockets because they are paying more taxes.  The Government is damaging the potential future for many small businesses and is adding to inflation and the overall cost of living in Ireland.</P>
        <P>How does the Government think our marketplace looks to a foreign company considering Ireland as a potential place in which to invest and create employment?  Does the Government think Ireland is more attractive in the wake of this budget?  I do not think so.  Ireland&rsquo;s success in the past two decades has been based primarily on competitiveness, a high quality education system and low tax rates but all of those elements are now being undermined by a budget which is purely a money-grabbing exercise.  Families across the country are being asked to bail out the Government for its disastrous economic management in the past three years in particular, if not before then.</P>
        <P>I am particularly interested in the carbon budget, of which the Government makes a big play.  It is held up as an example of the green side of Government, about which we have heard from the Ministers, Deputies John Gormley and Eamon Ryan, today.  However, if one compares last year&rsquo;s carbon budget figures to this year&rsquo;s figures, one sees immediately that the numbers do not tally.  In both carbon budgets, the figures provided for 2006 are different, despite the fact that 2006 was a year for which we had hard and fast figures.  In areas such as carbon sinks, which includes, for example, the contribution of forestry to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, the figures do not tally.  I seek an explanation from the Government on that issue.</P>
        <P>What is blatantly obvious from the carbon budget is that the country is going in the wrong direction, and dramatically so.  The projections in last year&rsquo;s carbon budget indicated that by the end of 2012 we would have net carbon emissions of just over 65 million tonnes.  That figure is now over 69 million tonnes.  The whole point of setting up a carbon budget was to examine <Col N="817"/>directional trends in terms of us meeting our climate change and emissions commitments.  Unfortunately for the Government, the structure it set up is proof that the national climate change strategy is not working.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 3% per year is a joke at the moment.</P>
        <P>The Minister said there has been press coverage to the effect that Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions have increased in the past year.  Our emissions have increased but the Minister tries to massage the figures by introducing increases in forestry in Ireland, which do not even count yet in terms of the targets we face under our Kyoto Protocol commitments and those made to the European Union.  Let us be honest with people.  We are failing the climate change challenge at the moment.</P>
        <P>I agree with much of what the Minister said earlier.  He outlined the longer term strategy for meeting the challenge of reducing our emissions.  It is important to say, at this point, that this is not a voluntary exercise.  We are obliged to meet the commitments we make in Brussels and elsewhere.  If we do not meet those commitments, we are fined.  In this budget, the Government has set aside &euro;50 million next year to pay fines for not meeting our emissions targets.  That equates to almost &euro;1 million per week from taxpayers because we are not meeting our targets.  This is not just about a green agenda or something about which only environmentalists should be concerned.  The fact that our climate change strategy is not working is costing every taxpayer in the country money.  This is despite the fact that we supposedly have a green tinge to Government, with two key Ministries held by Green Party Deputies.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on a number of areas to which the carbon budget refers, particularly energy.  I have a lot of time for the vision of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in terms of where he wants to take Ireland from an energy point of view.  I welcome the fact that the Government has made a new commitment to 40% of our energy coming from renewable resources by 2020.  It will be a tough task to achieve, but I welcome the ambitious thinking.  The ESB is providing real leadership in this area, which should be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>However, progress in the energy sector alone will not enable us to meet our international commitments because this is the traded sector in the European Union in terms of emissions targets.  That sector has nothing to do with the Government <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the commitments it makes.  Post 2012, the large energy generators will have to purchase carbon allowances, which is what will drive their change in behaviour.  In that context, we do not need to worry about the energy sector, apart from our overall responsibility to encourage change.  That sector is not relevant in terms of meeting our commitments and avoiding fines.  Even if 80% of our energy was generated from renewable sources, that would not solve our fundamental problems.  It is the non-traded sector for which the Government has responsibility.  Transport, residential, small industry and agriculture are the major areas where we need big ideas and those ideas are not coming forward.  Let us not kid ourselves that the big idea from Government, led by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in terms of building turbines onshore and off-shore and creating energy and emissions efficient generation solves our climate change commitment problem although it is a good thing.  We need to hammer this home and make it much clearer in our carbon budget.  The carbon budget is about measuring the Government&rsquo;s performance as well as the country&rsquo;s performance in terms of emissions.  We need far greater focus on the non-traded sector.</P>
        <P>Transport is a major problem area, but it is a big area of opportunity if we had really ambitious thinking from Government on it.  A target was set in the carbon budget this year that by 2020 10% of our road fleet would be made up of electric vehicles.  Will the Government examine what other countries are doing?  A target of 10% by 2020 is miserable in terms of <Col N="818"/>making the switch from petrol, diesel and biodiesel run vehicles to electric vehicles.  Let us get serious about promoting electric vehicles in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Look at what they are doing in Israel.  They are trying to switch an entire transportation system from carbon based fuels to electricity.  They are doing it for political reasons as well as economic reasons because they do not want to rely on oil.  Israel is not the only country doing this.  Denmark is also doing it.  Because Ireland is an island, it is an ideal place for this.  For the first time, companies are offering viable solutions.  Let us embrace these ideas and technology and make it happen.  Whether it is a 5% or a 7% biofuel mix will not make the dramatic change we need in the transport sector to meet the commitments we have made.  We need far more radical thinking in terms of our responsibilities, merging the transport and energy areas.</P>
        <P>The energy by-product, if one wants to call it that, of a transport sector heavily reliant on electric vehicles is that if everyone in the entire country plugs a car in at 12 o&rsquo;clock at night to recharge it we will have significant demand for electricity at 4 o&rsquo;clock in the morning which we do not have at present.  The big problem for energy generators in Ireland at present is the huge spike early in the morning when people get up and have showers.  It then dies down, picks up again at lunch time, dies down and picks up again when people go home after work.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to integrate inconsistent wind energy, and wind energy is inconsistent because it only blows approximately 40% of the time, often when we do not need the power.  We need to find a way of storing electricity we can use later in the day or in the evening.  One way to do so is to link transportation to electricity so people plug their vehicles in at night, in the afternoon or late in the morning when there is not a high demand for electricity.  This would balance the curve of electricity demand which would be of major benefit to EirGrid which has responsibility to manage the electricity grid and to everybody proposing to build a wind farm, a tidal turbine or wave bob.  Let us have more ambitious thinking which is what we need but which is not at all evident in the carbon budget or in yesterday&rsquo;s budget.</P>
        <P>I agree with a great deal of what my ministerial counterpart has to say on energy.  However, I am hugely critical of his and his Government&rsquo;s performance in terms of the IT sector.  How many times have we heard Ministers state that they want to create a knowledge economy in Ireland on the back of a world class information technology infrastructure?  What is the Government&rsquo;s response?  A 25% cut in the money it plans to spend on information and communications technology programmes.  This is a reduction from &euro;53 million to &euro;40 million.  The Minister expects us to take him seriously when he states he will put high speed broadband into schools throughout the country.  He has no credibility on this issue.</P>
        <P>We are cutting back in the most crucial infrastructural area for IT and knowledge economy development in Ireland in a dramatic way in this budget.  This is a major mistake in terms of the type of jobs we want to create over the next one, two or five years.  We will regret it.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Brendan Smith.</P>
        <P>Social welfare has been prioritised in this budget because next year total funding for the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be &euro;19.6 billion.  This represents an increase of &euro;2.6 billion or 15.5% over the Estimates allocation for 2008.  More than 1.7 million people and their dependents will benefit from this expenditure, including 440,000 pensioners, 345,000 ill and disabled people, more than 80,000 carers, 30,000 low income working families availing of the family income supplement and more than 580,000 families that receive child benefit payments.</P><Col N="819"/>
        <P>The budget includes provision for an average live register figure of, unfortunately, 290,000 next year.  This compares with an average of just under 210,000 in the nine months to the end of September this year and an expected average of 220,000 for 2008 as a whole.  The Government is doing everything it can to keep unemployment as low as possible but it is prudent in the current economic environment to set aside funding in case it continues to rise.</P>
        <P>Providing for the expected increase in the live register alone accounts for &euro;1.25 billion of the planned increase in spending next year.  In addition to this, provision has been made for &euro;515 million worth of improvements in social welfare rates and qualifying conditions.  At a time when it is essential that public expenditure be strictly controlled in the national interest, this increased provision for social welfare is an unambiguous statement of the Government&rsquo;s intent to protect the vulnerable and less well-off in society.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what was stated in June.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputies will appreciate, there was no easy way to achieve the required savings.  Consideration had to be given to a wide range of changes and very difficult decisions had to be made.  Neither I nor the Government have taken these decisions lightly.  In total, the new expenditure control measures contained in the social welfare budget will amount to net savings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Cutbacks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;of &euro;124.9 million next year when compensatory measures are taken into account.  Of this, &euro;72.7 million is accounted for by changes to the social insurance system.</P>
        <P>As Members know, Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system is based on two quite different types of entitlement, a social insurance system for people who have paid sufficient PRSI contributions and a social assistance system for people without adequate contributions who have little or no household means of their own.</P>
        <P>Social insurance is intended both to enable people to insure themselves against adverse life events such as illness or unemployment and to provide for their State pensions and other benefits, through contributions to the national social insurance fund.  Social insurance benefits are not means-tested.  Instead, entitlement depends on having paid the required number of PRSI contributions relevant to the benefit one wishes to claim.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For the past 11 years, the social insurance fund has been in surplus, with more than sufficient income to the fund to cover the payments being made from it each year, without the State having to provide a subsidy.  However, that is changing.  As a result of further increases in the live register, expenditure is expected to exceed income to the fund by over &euro;200 million this year and approximately &euro;900 million next year.  Although these current deficits can be met from the accumulated surplus, it looks likely that the Exchequer may yet again have to subsidise expenditure from the social insurance fund within a few years.  In that context, it is appropriate to look at some of the instances where people with a very limited or distant contribution record have been able to qualify for very significant benefits, regardless of their household income.</P><Col N="820"/>
        <P>Currently, people who have paid just 52 contributions in total can qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit and health and safety benefit.  This means, for example, that migrants or young workers who have only worked here for one year are entitled to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s payments for 12 months, without having to satisfy a means test.  This will change from next January, when the number of required paid contributions will be doubled to 104 contributions for new claimants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Why has the Minister added migrants to that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>A further anomaly that exists at present is that some people, who were previously working part-time, can receive a higher rate of payment from these schemes than what they were actually earning while at work.  Again, this is considered to be inappropriate and a disincentive to employment.  Therefore, from next January, this situation will be addressed by increasing the earnings thresholds which apply to the reduced or graduated rates of payment from &euro;150 to &euro;300 per week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>She is playing the race card.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Kevin Myers solution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>At present, it is necessary to have made 13 paid contributions in the relevant tax year to qualify for illness benefit.  However, this condition does not exist for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, with the result that people who may not have paid PRSI contributions in the past number of years can qualify.  Again, it is considered that this position does not adequately reflect the contribution-based rationale for social insurance.  Therefore, from next January, new claimants for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit will be required to satisfy the same conditions as those on illness benefit and must have paid 13 contributions in the relevant tax year.</P>
        <P>The other two changes being made to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit relate to the duration of the payment.  At present, people who have 260 or more paid social insurance contributions can receive jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for up to 15 months.  As of today, this is being limited to 12 months for current claimants with less than six months duration on the scheme, as well as for all new claimants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister means cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Where the claimant has less than 260 paid contributions, the maximum duration of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit will be nine months, instead of 12 months, if the claimant currently has been in receipt of benefit for less than three months and in respect of all new claimants.</P>
        <P>New claimants for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit will in future have to have paid a total of at least 104 contributions to the social insurance fund, with at least 13 of these paid in the relevant tax year.  The rate of payment will more closely reflect what the individual was earning prior to becoming unemployed and the duration of the payment will be either 12 or nine months depending on the number of social insurance contributions they have made in the past.  Taken together, these changes to jobseeker&rsquo;s, illness and health and safety benefits are expected to generate &euro;72.7 million in savings next year and &euro;119 million a year from 2010 on.</P>
        <P>Those who will be affected by these changes will be able to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or supplementary welfare allowance instead if they have limited means.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Not if they are living at home with their parents.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="821"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The maximum rate of these two schemes is paid at the same rate as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The final social insurance change involves a new limit on the duration of illness benefit payments.  Illness benefit was intended to provide income replacement for insured persons during short spells of incapacity or illness, while other payments are available to people who cannot work long term because of a disability or a medical condition.  However, there is no limit on the amount of time for which illness benefit can be paid to people who have more than 260 social insurance contributions.  Over 28,000 persons have been receiving the payment for more than two years.  As a forthcoming OECD review notes, &ldquo;paying sickness benefit without time limitation is very unusual across the OECD, for good reasons&rdquo;.  The report points out that there is a great risk that people in such circumstances will never return to the labour market.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the Government has decided to confine entitlement to illness benefit to two years&rsquo;, 624 days, duration for claims arising after 5 January 2009.  Persons currently in receipt of illness benefit will not be affected by the change.  Some 8,500 persons on illness benefit pass the threshold of two years&rsquo; duration on illness benefit each year and such persons are likely to be affected by the proposed ceiling on duration.</P>
        <P>Approximately two thirds of these will satisfy the medical criteria to access either invalidity pension or, subject to a means test, disability allowance.  Medical criteria for both of these schemes require certification that the condition is likely to last for a further 12 months.  This measure will not result in any savings in 2009 or 2010, but should save up to &euro;101 million in a full year after the two-year rule has fully come into effect, which will not be for a number of years.</P>
        <P>Changes will also be made to the disability allowance.  Currently this can be paid from age 16 to young people with a disability and is worth approximately &euro;200 per week.  Domiciliary care allowance is a payment to the parents of children who have a severe disability requiring continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.  It is worth approximately &euro;300 per month.</P>
        <P>The National Federation of Voluntary Bodies is an umbrella organisation for 63 voluntary agencies who provide direct services to people with intellectual disabilities.  Its members account for in excess of 85% of the country&rsquo;s direct service provision to people with intellectual disabilities.  Its submission to the Department&rsquo;s review of the disability allowance argued:</P>
        <P LI="1">At present the age for receipt of disability allowance is 16 years.  We deem this to be too young.  This does not give an incentive for a child to pursue work or education options.  Subsequently a child may fall into the dependency trap too early.  Instead parents should receive the domiciliary care allowance for the child until they are 18 years old.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government has decided to implement this change.  The age of eligibility for entitlement to disability allowance is being increased from 16 years to 18 years for new claimants.  This change will not affect existing 16 and 17 year olds on disability allowance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister feels so strongly about it, why not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As an alleviating measure, the age for entitlement to the domiciliary care allowance is being increased from 16 years to 18 years.  It is estimated that a weekly average of 539 persons will be affected by this measure in 2009 and 2,115 in a full year.  These changes are expected to save &euro;5.6 million in 2009 and &euro;16.6 million a year from 2010.</P><Col N="822"/>
        <P>The changes being made this year to illness benefit and disability allowance are intended as only the first steps in the modernisation of the illness and disability schemes.  A comprehensive approach will be developed when the reports of the current review of the disability allowance scheme and the OECD review are finalised and the Department has had the opportunity to assess them fully.</P>
        <P>The final expenditure control measure relates to the rent and mortgage interest supplements.  All recipients of these payments are expected to make a personal contribution towards their accommodation costs from their own resources.  The minimum level of this contribution is currently set at &euro;13 per week.  This rate has not been increased since January 2004, despite the fact the lowest rate of social welfare payment has risen by nearly &euro;70 per week since then.  It is also significantly less than the minimum rent paid by local authority tenants which, for example, is &euro;24.87 in Dublin city and &euro;26 in County Limerick.</P>
        <P>As of 1 January 2009, the minimum personal contribution to rent and mortgage interest supplement is being increased by &euro;5 to &euro;18 per week.  With some 72,000 people in receipt of rent and mortgage interest supplements, this measure is expected to generate &euro;19 million per annum from 2009 onwards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister would be better off taking on the developers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, the Minister for Finance announced the Government decided that from now on child benefit will no longer be paid in respect of those who are 18 years old.  At that age they are effectively treated as adults in most respects.  This change will be phased in gradually.  A half payment will be made in respect of existing and future qualifying children from January 2009.  From January 2010, the payment will cease from the 18th birthday.</P>
        <P>Special alleviating measures are being introduced for young people in social welfare dependent and low-income families, with a special increase of &euro;15 per week in the qualified child payment for those aged 18 years.  It is expected that some 10,000 young people will benefit from this measure.  In addition, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance will be increased by &euro;215 to &euro;520 per annum for eligible 18 year olds.  Recipients of family income supplement will receive additional payments of up to &euro;15 per week for each dependant aged 18 years where they are not otherwise being compensated.  These transitional measures will cease in January 2011.  The net savings from this change to child benefit entitlements is expected to be &euro;27.6 million in 2009, &euro;67.2 million in 2010 and &euro;79 million per annum from 2011 onwards.</P>
        <P>Even in these difficult economic times, the Government has prioritised delivering real increases in social welfare payments.  Some Opposition spokespersons have referred to the fact that the 2009 social welfare increases are below this year&rsquo;s inflation rate.  That is not the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="823"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget provides for increases of between 3% and 3.8% in the basic payment rates next year.  These increases are also in line with the wage rises agreed by the social partners in the second phase of the national pay agreement.</P>
        <P>The maximum personal rates of payment for the State contributory and non-contributory pensions and State pension transition are being increased by &euro;7 per week from the start of January 2009.  State pensioners will also receive an extra &euro;6.30 per week for a qualified adult dependant such as spouse aged over 66 years and an extra &euro;4.70 per week for contributory qualified adults under 66 years.</P>
        <P>The price of fuel is an issue of major concern for many people, but especially the elderly and the ill.  I am pleased to announce the value of the fuel allowance is being increased by &euro;2 to &euro;20 per week, an 11% increase, with effect from January.  The duration of the fuel season is also being extended &mdash; which is what many people asked for &mdash; by another two weeks from April 2009, bringing it to 32 weeks in total.</P>
    
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>We asked for more than that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>These improvements to the fuel scheme will cost almost &euro;30 million extra in 2009 and will benefit nearly 300,000 households.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>It is going out the window.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The maximum personal rate of payment for all working age schemes is being increased by &euro;6.50 per week with effect from the first week of January 2009, with proportionate increases applying to people on reduced rates.  The rates of qualified adult payments are also being increased on all schemes by &euro;4.30 except for the invalidity pension scheme where a &euro;4.60 increase will apply.</P>
        <P>Social welfare-dependent parents currently receive an extra &euro;24 per week for each child on top of their basic social welfare payments, through what is termed the &ldquo;qualified child increase&rdquo;.  This is being increased by &euro;2 to &euro;26, or 8.3%, per child with effect from January 2009.  In the case of qualifying children of 18 years of age, the total rate will come to &euro;41 per week, including the special payment in lieu of child benefit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister took the allowance from them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Improvements are also being made to the family income supplement, which is paid to low income working families.  Income limits for the FIS are being increased by &euro;10 per week in respect of each child, giving an average extra payment of &euro;6 per child per week.</P>
        <P>The income thresholds for entitlement to back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance are also being increased to enable 18,000 more families to benefit from the scheme.  These increases are in addition to the special measures already mentioned for 18 year old children.  In addition to these improvements in social welfare schemes, the budget also provides an extra &euro;500,000 for the Family Support Agency to support programmes to promote positive parenting skills.</P>
        <P>I now want to address the future of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  A review of the Combat Poverty Agency was undertaken on foot of a Government decision on 6 June 2007.  The purpose of the review was to examine the role of the agency in light of the emergence, since 1986, of comprehensive strategies and new institutional arrangements to promote social inclusion.  These include the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, the Office for Social Inclusion and the voluntary pillar in social partnership.</P><Col N="824"/>
        <P>Having considered the review report, the Government has decided to integrate the Combat Poverty Agency with the Office for Social Inclusion. I do not intend that the Combat Poverty Agency will simply be absorbed into the Office for Social Inclusion in its existing form.  Rather, a new strengthened division will be created, which will make the best use of the considerable experience and expertise of the staff of both existing bodies and will seek to address the weaknesses identified by the review in relation to both.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Where will that take it then?</P>
      </Speaker>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>This new division can provide a stronger voice for those affected by poverty and social inclusion issues.  I am conscious of the concerns about the need for independent scrutiny of public policy that have been expressed by some interest groups.  I agree that independent critique is very important and this move is not intended to reduce the scope for such work.  As the review report notes, the function of independent reporting on poverty is no longer as dependent on the Combat Poverty Agency as it was in earlier years.  This is due, for example, to the emergence of other independent data sources, such as the statistics on poverty reported by the CSO, and independent analyses by bodies such as the ESRI and NESC, and on the international front by the EU and OECD. </P>
        <P>Ireland is well served by the social partners and a wide range of NGOs and other groups who have a strong voice in public debate about poverty and related issues.  I intend to prioritise putting in place procedures to ensure that the views of these and other stakeholders, including people experiencing poverty, continue to be available to Government in developing and monitoring the social inclusion strategies.  The Department is currently finalising proposals as to how this might be achieved.</P>
        <P>Another body the Government examined as part of the review of State agencies was the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  MABS staff provide a highly valued service to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  However, it has been recognised for some time that the service needs a proper legislative basis and structure.  It has been decided that this can best be achieved by placing MABS with the Citizens Information Board.  The MABS and citizens information centres complement each other as both are involved in providing information, advice and advocacy services to the public.  In addition, the CIB has a long association with the MABS at both national and local level and was involved in establishing some of the original MABS pilot projects.  I stress that there will be no change in the status of the 53 independent MABS companies, nor in the employment status of their 240 employees.</P>
        <P>These are the main elements of the financial and other changes incorporated in the social and family affairs part of budget 2009.  With extra funding of &euro;2.6 billion next year, a range of improvements will be made in social welfare schemes, including &euro;7 extra per week for State pensioners; &euro;6.50 extra per week for welfare recipients of working age, such as jobseekers and those on illness benefit; an extra &euro;2 per week on the fuel allowance, with payment also being made for an additional two weeks; increases in child-related payments to those dependent on social welfare and improvements in the family income supplement for low income working families; and 18,000 more families becoming eligible for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.</P>
        <P>To fund these improvements along with making payments to increasing numbers of people on the live register, it has been necessary to make savings in some areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what the Minister said a few months ago.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="825"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we have kept these expenditure control measures to an absolute minimum.  I have confidence that, given the circumstances, we have done our best to protect those on social welfare who are most in need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>In preparing the 2009 Estimates for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, my approach has been to focus available resources on measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector.  That involved making choices, some of them difficult, but the choices I have made will facilitate the continued strategic development of the agri-food sector.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the current economic difficulties, the total expenditure by the Department in 2009, in support of the agriculture, fisheries, food and forestry sectors will be more than &euro;3.2 billion.  This high level of investment reflects my commitment and that of the Government to the bio-sector and our recognition of it as one of the most important indigenous manufacturing elements in our economy, both from an employment point of view and as a major contributor to regional development.</P>
        <P>In addition to the significant amounts of money that are continuing to be invested in agriculture by the Government in 2009, I am particularly pleased that the Minister for Finance has recognised the value of several tax reliefs to the sector and that he has renewed these measures, notwithstanding the pressures on him.  The renewal of these measures is further evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of a competitive agri-food sector at a time when it can play a pivotal role in helping to address global food security concerns.</P>
        <P>It is perhaps ironic that at this time of global economic downturn, the prospects for agricultural commodities on world markets are good.  Currently, prices for a wide range of commodities, particularly dairy and some cereals, are higher than they have been for many years and there is general agreement that in the medium term, at least, prices are unlikely to return to their historically low levels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>Try telling that to dairy farmers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As Ireland is a major food producing and exporting economy, this is good news for the agriculture and food sector and presents us with opportunities into the future.  It is precisely for this reason that I have targeted my Department&rsquo;s resources in 2009 at the most productive elements of the sector to ensure that it continues to prosper and continues towards  achievement of its full potential.</P>
        <P>The Department operates a wide range of schemes and services, all of which came under scrutiny in the preparation of next year&rsquo;s Estimates.  I undertook a thorough review of all such schemes before choosing those for which I could prioritise funding.  The Department&rsquo;s single biggest and, perhaps, flagship scheme is the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme, REPS, which has some 60,000 participants.  I place a particular value on this scheme that meets environmental imperatives and consumer demands.  Accordingly, I decided to maintain the scheme in full and have provided additional funding that brings next year&rsquo;s expenditure to &euro;355 million, an increase of 7%.  Between 2000 and 2009, the Department will have invested &euro;2.25 billion in funding to REPS participants.  This additional funding ensures full payment to those already contracted under both REPS 2 and 3, who opt to see out their existing contracts, as well as those new applicants to REPS 4, who undertake new five-year commitments, and those transferring from REPS 2 and 3.  REPS 4 payments include a 17% increase in payment rates.</P>
        <P>I have also ensured that commitment entered into in partnership to spend &euro;250 million on a suckler welfare scheme is fully honoured.  Such was the success of the scheme that the levels of participation exceeded all expectation.  This year&rsquo;s level of participation, at a premium rate <Col N="826"/>of &euro;80 per head, will cost the Department &euro;77 million.  It will be necessary to correct the premium rate over the remaining four years of the scheme, but I am committed to the payment of the remaining &euro;173 million over the remaining life of the scheme.  The premium rate in the remaining years will depend on the participation rate and at current levels, the premium may have to be reduced by up to half.  In respect of 2009, all payments that would ordinarily fall to be paid in late November 2009 will be delayed slightly until early January 2010.</P>
        <P>Forestry is a particularly important sector, not least in providing important income to farmers and employment in rural areas as well as contributing significantly to meeting the challenge of climate change.  The 2009 Estimate provides &euro;127.7 million for the sector.  While, more than &euro;80 million will be directed to payments of premia, mostly to farmers, there will also be generous support for planting and support schemes.  The level of funding provided should allow planting to be maintained close to this year&rsquo;s level.</P>
        <P>I have also restated my commitment and that of the Government to support the Irish fishing sector through the provision of &euro;30 million, which does not include the funding provided to Bord lascaigh Mhara, with particular prioritised investment in fish processing, aquaculture development and fishery harbours.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, my commitment to the schemes to which I have referred must come at some price and I have, therefore, reluctantly decided to reduce expenditure under the scheme of area-based compensatory payments.  The provision for that scheme next year is being reduced to &euro;220.4 million.  However, this reduction will be targeted through reducing the maximum hectarage limit on which payments are to be made from 45 to 34 hectares and through a modest increase in the stocking density requirement, a requirement which has been advocated by some farm representatives for some time.  Based simply on the reduction in the maximum hectarage to 34 hectares, some 67,000 of the 102,000 participants will experience no reduction in their payments.  The modest increase in the stocking density requirement will have an impact on a further small number of scheme participants.</P>
        <P>I have also chosen to temporarily suspend entry to both the early retirement and young farmer installation schemes with immediate effect.</P>

	<P>Shameful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>While there have been a healthy number of applications under the installation scheme this year, applications for the early retirement scheme are relatively modest.  However, it is worth making the point that all current participants in the scheme will be paid and applications received to date will be processed and next year almost &euro;57 million is being provided to meet current commitments.</P>
        <P>In his budget speech yesterday, the Minister for Finance specifically referred to the renewal of several tax reliefs of benefit to the farming sector.  Several reliefs specifically targeted at new entrants are particularly welcome, especially given the notable increase in the number of young people entering agricultural college over the past two years and renewed optimism in the sector.  Of particular value is the extension of young trained farmers&rsquo; stamp duty relief for four years until the end of 2012.  This was a significant component of Macra na Feirme&rsquo;s pre-budget submission and is aimed at bringing about a level of stability and security to families planning and organising early farm transfers.  This relief is estimated to be worth &euro;53 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>The top rate of stamp duty on agricultural land transactions has been reduced from 9% to 6% on agricultural land transactions above &euro;80,000.  This should help reduce the purchase cost for buyers and make transactions more affordable.</P><Col N="827"/>
        <P>Also of benefit to young farmers is the renewal of the 100% rate of stock relief which is useful for young farmers building up the value of their herds.  The general 25% rate of stock relief for all farmers was also renewed.  Both these reliefs were renewed for a period of two years until 31 December 2010 at an estimated cost of &euro;2 million per year.</P>
        <P>Stamp duty relief for farm consolidation is renewed for a two-year period until the end of June 2011.  The relief is aimed at farmers reducing their farm fragmentation through the purchase and sale of parcels of land in accordance with the appropriate guidelines.   The accelerated rate of capital allowances has also been renewed for a further two years allowing a write-off period of three years and a floating allowance of the lesser of 50% of qualifying expenditure or &euro;31,750 in any one year.  This measure is estimated to be worth &euro;10 million in a full year.  This broad range of budget measures are aimed at supporting improvements in farm structures by encouraging new entrants, farm consolidation and mobility.  Combined, these cost-efficient measures are estimated to be worth more than &euro;65 million in total in a full year.</P>
        <P>There has been much comment over the past 24 hours on public service reform, much of it uninformed and incorrect.  The public service is not immune from the decisions that have to be taken at this time.  The grants-in-aid to the State bodies under the Department&rsquo;s aegis, namely Teagasc, Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Marine Institute and the SFPA, are being reduced to take account, in particular, of the need to achieve payroll and other efficiency savings.  These savings must be seen against what was a significant increase in funding to these organisations in recent years.  Next year, I will provide &euro;235 million to them to support agricultural, fisheries, food and forestry activities and I will ask them to prioritise their activities in the light of the current budgetary position and having regard to overall policy for the sector.</P>
        <P>In addition, the salaries provision for my Department will require a further fall in staff numbers of 150 by the end of next year.  This is in addition to a reduction of almost 500 in recent years and my Department is engaged actively in a programme of reviews aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness with which we provide such a wide range of services to all our stakeholders.  It is no more than the taxpayer deserves.</P>
        <P>The agri-food sector is of central importance to our economy.  Success will be achieved by reliance on quality, innovative and sustainable food production.  We have many natural advantages in food production and have developed a sophisticated food industry.  The opportunities now emerging for us as a food producing country are there to be grasped.  I assure the House that, for its part, the Government realises the potential of the sector.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the severe budgetary pressures, through Exchequer and EU funding, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will invest &euro;3.2 billion in support of the agriculture, fisheries, food and forestry sectors next year.  In addition, the Minister for Finance has also committed to the renewal of tax relief worth &euro;65 million for a further period of two years in most cases and four years in one case to which I earlier referred which was made at the request of Macra na Feirme.  I am also particularly pleased that the Minister has confirmed that the possibility of further measures specifically targeted at young farmers will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>Despite suggestions to the contrary, the Government&rsquo;s level of commitment to and investment in agriculture is significant and recognises the role the sector has to play and the enormous contribution it makes to the Irish economy.  My approach is targeted at the specific intention of protecting the sector&rsquo;s most productive elements and ensuring that it continues to prosper.  That approach requires choices to be made and a balance to be struck.  I am satisfied that the choices I have made are the right ones and in the best interests of the Irish agri-food sector at this time.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="828"/>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this budget.  I speak for most people in the country, certainly for this side of the House, when I say there was readiness to take some bad news and hardship if we felt it was to some purpose.  What has been most disappointing is that such will not be the case.  We, and most commentators expect us to be back here with cuts at least as bad this time next year, if not sooner.</P>
        <P>The truth is what was needed was not done.  We cut capital spending and borrowed to continue with current spending.  Some &euro;4.7 billion is to be borrowed, and God knows to what that will grow as the year progresses.  Far from correcting a nose-dive in the economy, this can only make matters worse.  Where there was spending, there was no attempt to produce long-term reform to deal with the problems so that we could be in a position to capitalise on any later upturn in the global economy.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S is a case in point.  Never will it be more important to be able to up-skill and retrain our workforce, and yet there is a budget of almost &euro;1 billion, largely money contributed by the private sector, that is completely unfocused, hardly relevant and inefficiently spent, and there has been no attempt to reform that organisation.</P>
        <P>The investment in infrastructure, particularly in public transport, has been tragically cut again.  That means Transport 21 is out the door, probably for another generation or maybe even two.  The history of this Government has been a failure of planning and of delivery.  There has been no mention of metro.  I heard last night that it will remain in the planning stage.  It has been in planning for ten years.  It will probably be another ten, maybe 20, years before we hear any more about it.  The result of all this is that people are even more dependent on their cars, and the Government&rsquo;s solution is to introduce a car parking tax.  One could understand this tax if it would make people use public transport, but the reality is it will end up only as a tax on work.</P>
        <P>The Government failed to make difficult decisions.  It made things difficult for people, but the difficult decisions which only the Government can make were not made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will speak about my area of responsibility, arts, sports and tourism, but I am conscious I must say something about the sick, the disabled and the elderly, the easy targets who undoubtedly will be the really big suffers as a result of this budget.  These are easy targets because they are not a cohesive group.  In any battle for scarce resources they will be the ones the Government can pick off one by one, and it could not resist the opportunity to do so.</P>
        <P>Many of my colleagues have spoken eloquently about the removal of entitlement to medical cards from the over 70s.  I do not want to go into it, except to state it is the most mean-minded and damaging economy I have ever heard of a government attempting to introduce.  It was despicable to hear the Minister for Health and Children try to defend it on the grounds that it was costing a great deal of money, with the money going to doctors.  The reason for that is the Government did a bad deal with the doctors.  The Government announced the measure before it reached a deal with the doctors, and taxpayers ended up paying more than they should.  The Government&rsquo;s solution is to ask old and sick people, who have worked all their lives, contributed to the economy and made the Celtic tiger, to pay for the Government&rsquo;s mistake by the withdrawal of their medical cards.</P>
        <P>Thousands of middle income families in my constituency and throughout the country are being targeted in the budget, specifically in the area of health.  One measure which has not received a great deal of attention, except in respect of nursing homes, is the decision to reduce tax relief from the marginal rate to the standard rate for medical expenses.  This measure is aimed specifically at families who have always paid their own way.  They pay for their general practitioner, medicines &mdash; for which they will now pay &euro;100 per month &mdash; health insurance, the <Col N="829"/>dentist, hospital tests, scans, physiotherapists and every other medical expense.  Overnight, the cost of medicine for those families has increased by 20%.</P>
        <P>When there are children in a family it is impossible to avoid medical expenses.  For most families there are sometimes exceptional medical expenses in respect of at least one member of the family.  A number of families contacted me about this measure today, particularly families whose children require orthodontic treatment.  For them, the cost of that treatment has increased by 20%.  Everybody knows that State-provided orthodontic treatment scarcely exists.  The treatment is hugely expensive so a 20% increase will run to thousands of euro.  For many families it will no longer be an option.  I am not talking about orthodontic treatment for cosmetic purposes but treatment that is essential for psychological or medical reasons.  That will no longer be an option.  This is one of the measures that has slipped under the carpet but it will emerge as the months pass.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach spoke about the relief for medical expenses this morning as if it was only relevant to nursing homes.  All medical expenses will be affected for middle income earners who do not have a medical card.  Everybody will be affected.  Indeed, the Taoiseach suggested that when the fair deal is introduced it will not be relevant because it will not be required by people going into nursing homes.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The reality is that if one has been prudent and saved for one&rsquo;s old age, if one has savings in the bank or under the mattress or if one has dividends, shares or a painting on the wall, everything must be spent before one will even become eligible for the fair deal.  The fair deal is only relevant to some people, and it is clear that it will not be fair to everybody.</P>
        <P>These are the hidden costs of the budget.  The Ministers glibly spoke last night about a percentage here and a percentage there but each of these percentages is bitterly felt by families.  They will be bitterly felt over the coming months, particularly when added to other taxes, charges and cuts.  I warn the Government, and I hope it acts before it happens, that people will die as a result of this.  They will forgo medicine and visiting the doctor.  It will not be a saving in the long run.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen.  He distinguished himself as the only Minister who saw a reduction in every budget line for his Department.  He is not long in the Department but he has become extremely creative.  His press statement yesterday would warrant a prize for creativity.  He managed to be the only Minister who compared his Department&rsquo;s allocations for 2009 to those for 2000 to show that somehow there was an increase when, in fact, there was a decrease in each of his Department&rsquo;s budget lines.</P>
        <P>Yes, these are hard times and we understood there would be a reduction in spending, but why an all-out assault on the tourism industry?  This is incomprehensible.  We will require this industry to provide growth in employment and income in the future.  It is a service industry.  We will not see growth in many other industries such as manufacturing and so forth, which are dying industries to an extent.  The service industry is where we must generate growth and foreign exchange.  However, a departure tax is purely a revenue raising tax.  It has zero policy content.  It will not just apply to Irish people leaving the country but people who come to this country, who will be charged when they leave.  We should be incentivising people to come to this country, not picking their pockets as they leave.</P>
        <P>This will also impact on the aviation sector, which is already a marginal industry with operators barely keeping their heads above water.  Ryanair has threatened to pull out of Shannon Airport because its fares will effectively double as a result of this charge.  It is the whammy Aer Lingus certainly did not need.  The Government is trying to persuade people to vote for the EU and says the Union is based on the fundamental tenet of free movement of people, but <Col N="830"/>I do not know if this tax is legal within the EU.  When one combines transport costs, VAT, holiday home taxes and 50 cent on a bottle of wine with reduced marketing, it is hard to believe the Government has an appreciation of the importance of the tourism industry.  Watch the holiday home tax.  This year it is &euro;200, next year it will be &euro;400 and, mark my words, the year after it will be on all homes.</P>
        <P>The Minister tried to tell us there is a minuscule reduction in funding for the Arts Council, scarcely 1%.  In fact, the reduction is 12%.  Jobs will be lost.  Jobs in the arts are marginal anyway and they will go.  This will impact not only on the indigenous industry, but also on tourism as festivals and performances are hit.  Sport is affected in every budget line and crucial funding for the Sports Council has also been savaged.  In the area of capital spending, all the investment in the cultural institutions, which are already on the bread line, has been cut to ribbons.  Many of these institutions are in such a condition that we will be lucky if they do not burn to the ground in the next couple of years.</P>
        <P>Funding for the national sports campus has been reduced by one third, despite the massive expansion that was announced by successive Ministers.  That appears to have evaporated into the ether, along with the former Taoiseach whose legacy and monument it was to be.  All one can see out there is a couple of offices.  This has been a budget of cuts, taxes and charges, with no strategy, tactic or policy content.  It is just a holding exercise until the next swingeing budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the budget.  Lest the public consider our contributions unjustified criticism from a party that has not nailed its colours to the mast, Fine Gael has published its alternative policy approach to the difficult financial time the country faces.  We have identified, for example, that there is a price worth paying in respect of the security that civil and public service employment provides by proposing a pay pause for that sector.  We have identified savings across all Departments and sought the elimination of the multiplicity of quangos that have been created.  We have presented an alternative view.</P>
        <P>Today we have an opportunity to provide a critique of the Government&rsquo;s policy and approach.  While there is an international dimension to what is happening in this country, by international comparison the situation here is far worse due to the successive policy decisions of the current Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance over the last four budgets.  The infatuation with the construction industry at the expense of the exposed trading sector of the economy, which was the original driver of the Celtic tiger economy, has cost an enormous price.  Alone among EU countries, Ireland has rapidly rising unemployment, the single greatest barometer of economic failure.</P>
        <P>I will deal with several issues concerning my area of responsibility, that is, agriculture, fisheries and food.  I am disappointed the Minister has left the Chamber because it is obvious he is now clearly the weakest link in Cabinet.  He has sacrificed the industry with the potential to drive the economic recovery.  It is not an option for farmers to relocate to eastern Europe or Asia as their future is rooted in the Irish economy.  There are more than 100,000 employed directly in the industry and perhaps as many more employed indirectly in the food and associated service industries.</P>
        <P>The agriculture industry has considerable untapped potential but it has been betrayed.  One of the main structural problems facing the industry is that 92% of farms are run by farmers over 35.   In recent years, there has been a three-pronged approach to encouraging mobility such that highly qualified, young trained farmers could have access to the means of food production, thereby driving the agriculture and food industries.  The three prongs are the early retirement scheme, the installation aid scheme and the stamp duty exemption scheme.</P><Col N="831"/>
        <P>The Minister lauds the fact that the stamp duty exemption scheme has not been abolished but the reality is that, in 12 months, there will be a significant decline in the number availing of the stamp duty exemption for young qualified farmers simply because their parents will not hand over their land-holdings because of the abolition of the early retirement scheme.  Young farmers will not be encouraged to take the batons from their parents because the &euro;15,000 installation aid grant, traditionally paid directly into the pockets of young qualified farmers, will not be available.  Shame on the Minister.  It is a vote of &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; by the Minister in the new generation that the industry desperately requires to be involved.  It is unforgivable of the Minister to behave in this fashion.</P>
        <P>There has been a significant reduction in payments in two other areas under the agriculture budget, the suckler cow welfare scheme and the disadvantaged areas scheme.  In this regard, I refer to a press release of 14 December 2007 by the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, when announcing the suckler cow welfare scheme, which was to run until 2012 and result in an annual payment of &euro;80 per cow, or &euro;82 for every cow if an application was made on-line.  She stated, &ldquo;Ireland is a food trading country, and our beef industry which has a self-sufficiency of 820%, serves a huge number of customers throughout Europe and the world.&rdquo;  She added, &ldquo;we have adopted a structured approach to the beef sector, the overall aim of which is to equip it to meet the challenges and exploit the opportunities available in the coming years.&rdquo;  She concluded by stating, &ldquo;I am confident the scheme will be a success, and will contribute over the next five years and beyond to the continued improvement in the quality of Irish beef, so vital if we are to improve our share of the lucrative European market.&rdquo;  This statement was made less than 12 months ago, yet the scheme is now being butchered significantly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a variation on a theme that is becoming quite common under the Government and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Only last October, the farm investment scheme was suspended.  It was launched the previous July and was expected to run for five years.  What is clearly emerging is a form of political leadership in the Department that makes decisions on the hoof and has no strategic long-term plan for the industry.  It betrays the new generation that is committed to agriculture and attending agriculture colleges throughout the country to obtain the young farmer qualification known as the &ldquo;green certificate&rdquo;.  This generation wishes to take the baton but now finds the door to the industry has been closed by the abolition of the early retirement scheme and installation aid.  It is unforgivable.</P>
        <P>In addition to these cuts, one must consider the cuts affecting Bord Bia, Teagasc and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I will not criticise these cuts excessively until I know their exact impact.  I do not believe any organisation is beyond becoming more efficient but the percentages across the bodies in question &mdash; 8%, 9% and 10% &mdash; are on the high side.  The research and development potential of Teagasc should not be compromised.  It is by innovation that we will make progress and develop new products that will give the industry opportunities for the future.</P>
        <P>I am particularly concerned about the transfer of the marketing role of Bord Iascaigh Mhara to Bord Bia.  Within Bord Bia, which does a fine job promoting Irish food, the budget for the seafood sector should be ring-fenced.  I am concerned that the seafood industry will lose its identity.  It is extremely important that it have ring-fenced funds within Bord Bia comparable to those made available to it to date under Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I am concerned because I have been unable to trace any line in the budget following up on the commitment the Minister made last year that the funding for decommissioning the whitefish fleet would be made available again this year.  It is unavailable.</P>
        <P>The abolition of installation aid and the early retirement scheme, the butchering of the suckler cow scheme, which will probably result in the promised payment of &euro;82 being reduced <Col N="832"/>to approximately &euro;40, and the significant curtailment of disadvantaged area payments for claimants with more than 35 hectares constitute a real betrayal of the agriculture sector, which has the potential to lead us out of the difficulties we face.</P>
        <P>I will comment on aspects of the budget that do not pertain to agriculture.  Many speakers referred to the most unkind cut of all, that is, the withdrawal of the medical card from those over 70.  Despite the best efforts of the Government to spin this issue, 125,000 of the 139,000 who hold a medical card today will not retain one after the new means test.  This, allied with hospital charges, general practitioner visits, accident and emergency charges and drug refund scheme changes, will have an enormous impact on their financial well-being.  Their mental well-being will also be affected because they will fear becoming sick and not being able to afford to see a general practitioner.</P>
        <P>Added to this is the fact that in recent years many elderly people, because of the security of having a medical card, surrendered their medical insurance policies.  Such people may now be obliged to pay for medical insurance again but will find they will have to wait a defined period before being covered by any health insurance company.  This, allied to the fact that many of them will be liable not only to the Lenihan levy of 1% on their incomes but also to a 2% health levy, is alarming.  Losing the medical card may constitute a single whammy but all the other charges result in a multiple whammy for the elderly.  The Government should reconsider these cuts in the health sector.</P>
        <P>Let me consider two other issues.  Great political capital was derived in my constituency because of the proposed decentralisation of some 100 laboratory jobs in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to Macroom and of 80 jobs in the Office of Public Works to Kanturk.  This proves to have been a political charade played out at the expense not only of those employed in those offices but also of those locals who legitimately expected secure employment to be delivered to their towns.  This is particularly the case because the towns are reeling at present due to increases in unemployment rates of more than 50% in the past 12 months.  The Government has a considerable case to answer regarding these commitments and how it misled people over a prolonged period.</P>
        <P>I will now address the education cuts.  Solemn commitments with regard to class sizes were given at public meetings I attended in the lead-up to the last general election.  Now we will have the largest class sizes in the OECD.  We must take into account that many of the OECD countries are not nearly as wealthy as this country, yet we are failing to provide the passport for young people into secure employment by virtue of education provision, which is unforgivable.  Added to this is the cowardice of the Minister for Education and Science, who during the summer flew the kite to reintroduce college fees by the back door but who has not got the political bottle to stand up and announce that it is effectively college fees by another name.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an overall assumption in the budget that the worst of the downturn has become apparent and that there will be an upturn in a year or two.  The problem is that while there may be an improvement, it cannot be assumed that the conditions of recent years will return.  However, the Government in its budget is content that reducing the deficit a little and pencilling in a 7% deficit for next year is fine as the economy will improve thereafter and there is little need for further action.  This is very optimistic.</P>
        <P>The budget is optimistic in assuming that inflation will fall to 2.5%, which may happen but is towards the lower end of expectations.  As a result, while capital expenditure is not cut too much in nominal terms, if inflation is high then there will be real cuts in this area.  Also, the current expenditure assumptions will come under severe strain.  Forecasts for current expendi<Col N="833"/>ture of 4.5% in 2010 and 2.8% in 2011 which are contained in the tables in the appendix on the Department&rsquo;s website also look optimistic.</P>
        <P>The result is that this must be seen as a stopgap enabling budget.  It is action of a sort in response to the greatly changed circumstances but the assumption that an upturn will be highly beneficial in the near future means that another tough budget is on the cards within a year.  We must not forget this is the second budget in ten months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be after the local elections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Most likely.  If this is not the case, next year&rsquo;s budget will have to be much harder than the current year&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>While I do not have much time, I wish to address several issues.  The 1% employment levy can only be described as the most inequitable in the history of the State.  We are taxing students earning a few euro to try to get through college and pensioners trying to boost existing pensions which have fallen significantly.  Such people may be adding &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 to their annual income but we are taxing them at the same rate as those earning &euro;95,000.  It has never happened before that we have taken such an incredibly retrograde step.</P>
        <P>The issue of medical cards has been dealt with so I will address the issue of business.  There is nothing in the budget that could be characterised as providing anything in the way of a long-term impetus for business in this State.  The Government seems to be clapping itself on the back because corporation tax remains at the current rate.  However, it did not have an option to raise it.  If it had done so, it would have benefited the countries throughout Europe who are currently wiping our eye, such as Switzerland, which offers zero corporation tax if one locates in certain cantons.  Other countries have 3% to 5% corporation tax for one reason only, namely, they are happy to get business into their country to earn social insurance levies and income tax from the people employed.</P>
        <P>The corporation tax rate was set by the rainbow Government of which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy Quinn were members.  From what I am told, many of the mandarins in the Department of Finance almost had nosebleeds at the idea of reducing and rationalising the rates, but Deputy Quinn did it.  Another man who took bolder steps than we have seen for many years is the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy, who reduced capital gains tax from 40% to 20%.  What does this Government do but reverse that trend and bring it up to 22%, a 10% increase, which is large by any standard?  To advise the Government Members opposite, perhaps they should bringing back Mr. McCreevy in the way Gordon Brown brought back Peter Mandelson.  Dublin South has a by-election in a few months.  He could be bunged in there to see how he does and perhaps he could then be bunged back into the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>VAT will increase from 21% to 21.5%, which is another tax on business.  Capital spending cuts are widespread.  Overall, capital expenditure falls by 9% and if we assume inflation remains close to 5%, this is a very large reduction.  Much of this, however, is taken up by cuts in agencies and quangos.  If waste is eliminated, that is fine, but it is far more likely that front line delivery will be cut to balance budgets in these agencies.</P>
        <P>The figures presented last year by the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, the then Minister for Finance, showed that our national debt ratio versus GDP stood at 25% at that time.  Today, we are predicting a deficit of approximately 0.9% of GDP, which translates as &euro;11 billion.  How can the Government have got these figures so wrong?  I have a major concern with regard to this year&rsquo;s GDP ratio, which the Department of Finance is pitching at 43%, a colossal 18% increase which almost doubles the national debt in a very short period without factoring in billions of euros that will be needed down the line to bail out the banks.  We are in dire straits and in perhaps the worst economic crisis in the history of the State.</P>

	<P>A total of &euro;551 million has been allocated to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism for 2009, which includes &euro;405 million for current spending and &euro;146 million for capital projects.  This figure represents a substantial investment by the Government in the arts, sport and tourism sectors and must be seen against the background of significant expenditure that has taken place in recent years.</P>
        <P>While there has been a substantial reduction in the allocation for capital expenditure from &euro;277 million in 2008 to &euro;146 million this year, this relates to the fact that the 2008 budget made provision for large once-off projects in the sports and arts areas, including Lansdowne Road, which received &euro;93 million last year, the Gate Theatre, the new Opera House in Wexford &mdash; which I have seen and look forward to seeing again tomorrow, and which is one of the most fabulous opera houses anywhere in the world &mdash; the new Lighthouse Cinema in Smithfield, the Carlow Arts Centre and the Everyman Theatre.  The Government commitment to these projects is now almost complete and they account for &euro;113 million in the Department&rsquo;s capital allocation in 2009.  When those once-off projects are taken into account, the underlying upward trend in the capital available to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is maintained.</P>
        <P>I will deal now with the individual sectors under my responsibility.  The maintenance of a significant allocation for tourism services in 2009 reflects the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to the development of tourism as an important economic sector which contributes some &euro;5 billion in foreign revenue earnings, 250,000 jobs and &euro;2.3 billion in estimated tax receipts.  The tourism sector has made major progress over the past ten years, with overseas visitor numbers doubling to 8 million and foreign revenue earnings increasing by a factor of 2.5 to &euro;5 billion.  This impressive performance was driven by a clear Government development strategy, in partnership with the industry, and by a range of supporting programmes and initiatives in the areas of marketing, product development and training.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the current domestic and international environment is very challenging for tourism worldwide and in Ireland.  Increased fuel costs and a global economic downturn, with adverse trends in exchange rates, are affecting business.  Current indications are that Ireland is maintaining its market share in Europe and many competitors are faring less well.  Latest figures from the Central Statistics Office show that, notwithstanding the difficult global environment, the number of overseas visitors for the first six months of 2008 was up by 2.6% on the same period in 2007.  The strongest growth was in the mainland European and long-haul markets, reflecting the broader economic trends.</P>
        <P>There was a 1.3% increase in revenue from overseas visitors in the first half of this year.  In actual terms, expenditure from overseas visitors for the first six months was more than &euro;2 billion.  Figures since July are less positive and mirror trends across Europe, where the year started positively but saw a downturn in monthly figures from May onwards.  However, the strategic approach taken to tourism in recent years by both the public and private sectors has given the sector the capacity to withstand such cyclical external challenges and sustain its performance in coming years.  The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation has stated that the fundamentals of the industry remain strong and Irish tourism is better positioned to withstand any downturn than in the past.  As our overseas tourism business has diversified across a wider range of markets in recent years, that has given it the capacity to better withstand pressures on particular markets.  The total allocation for tourism in 2009 is approximately &euro;160.5 million.  The amount secured is a very positive outcome in the challenging circumstances facing the <Col N="835"/>country and is recognition of the importance of tourism as an economic sector.  Our investment in front-line international tourism marketing is being maintained.  The allocation for the tourism marketing fund, TMF, for 2009 is &euro;48.5 million.  Although that is a reduction of &euro;1.5 million there will be no reduction in the amount available for front-line marketing activities.  That is because, in 2008, Tourism Ireland invested on a once-off basis on renewing the Ireland tourism brand, including the development of new promotional material.  In the five years from 2004 to 2009, the tourism marketing fund will have increased by more than 50% from &euro;31 million in 2004 to &euro;48.5 million in 2009.</P>
        <P>Within the overall tourism marketing fund, the allocation for 2009 will enable the tourism agencies, in partnership with industry interests, to maintain the super regions campaign &mdash; for which an identical amount to 2008, &euro;3.15 million, is being provided.  As in 2008, &euro;3 million has been provided also to allow for the continuation of Discover Ireland&rsquo;s wonderful west campaign, for the wider Shannon Airport catchment area, in line with the commitment given in the Shannon Airport catchment area economic and tourism development plan.</P>
        <P>Given the overall economic situation, the tourism agencies should also be in a position to negotiate better value in terms of advertising and marketing space, because there is a real reduction in available spend across the business world in terms of accessing media.  A total of approximately &euro;19.4 million has been provided for the administration and general expenses of Tourism Ireland.  The slight reduction on the 2008 figure will be achieved through reductions in administrative expenditure, non-programme advertising and consultancy spending.  That represents a very positive outcome and demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment, in co-operation with the Northern Ireland Executive, to marketing the island of Ireland overseas.  While we are obviously in a particularly difficult time, maintaining the front-line overseas marketing allocation, as I have done, will allow Tourism Ireland to play its part in helping the sector to manage the current challenges and to return to sustainable growth in the medium term.</P>
        <P>The budget provided to F&aacute;ilte Ireland is &euro;80.791 million, a reduction of just 2.5% over the 2008 provision.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland should be able to achieve these savings without any impact on front-line services to the industry.  It is expected that the bulk of the savings can be made in administration, non-programme advertising and consultancy spending.  That figure includes our commitment to the Irish stop-over in Galway of the Volvo Ocean Yacht Race 2008-2009, which will provide an economic bonus of &euro;44 million to the west of Ireland region and for Ireland as a whole.  It also includes contributions to Ireland&rsquo;s hosting of the Solheim Cup &mdash; the ladies Ryder Cup equivalent &mdash; in Meath in 2011, and the contribution towards hosting the World Rally Championship in the north west in January 2009.  Both of those events will have significant spin-off economic benefits for their regions.</P>
        <P>In 2009 capital funding of &euro;11 million is being provided to support investment in key tourism infrastructure, attractions and visitor activity facilities that are in need of upgrading and development, and to bring on-stream new products and experiences to meet the sophisticated needs of a more discerning international visitor.  Although lower than the 2008 figure, the allocation in 2009 reflects a careful assessment of the range and quality of applications under F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s tourism capital investment programme as well as the anticipated drawdown of funds in 2009.</P>
        <P>Following the Government decision regarding State agencies, my officials are in discussion with the affected agencies to ensure that the transition and necessary changes are achieved in the most efficient manner possible.</P>
        <P>The huge social and economic benefits of sport are acknowledged by the Government and are reflected in the unprecedented level of Government funding for sport in recent years.  As a result of our investment in sporting facilities in the past ten years people now have more <Col N="836"/>opportunities to play and compete in a vast array of sports than ever before.  The provision of approximately &euro;204 million for sport in budget 2009 is a significant investment and will enable the Department to meet its commitments in 2009.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;56 million has been provided for the sports capital programme to meet costs from existing allocations in 2009.  That will bring to &euro;780 million Government expenditure on sports facilities at local, regional and national level in the past ten years and underlines the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the provision of sports facilities.  The allocation for the local authority swimming pool programme next year is &euro;18 million.  The current round of the programme provides for 57 swimming pool projects.  Of those, 37 projects have been completed and opened to the public, eight other pools are under construction and another 12 are at various stages of development.  The total amount invested by Government in this programme in the past eight years is approximately &euro;123 million.</P>
        <P>The Irish Sports Council, ISC, will receive an allocation of just over &euro;53 million for 2009.  While the 2008 allocation was &euro;57.6 million, the 2009 funding is still significant and represents an increase of more than 300% on the 2000 funding level of &euro;13 million.  I am confident that allocation will be sufficient to support the work of the ISC in maintaining existing programmes and to build on recent significant progress in all areas including local sports partnerships, Bunt&uacute;s, women in sport, older people and sport, youth field sports and the high performance programme.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to confirm the Lansdowne Road stadium project continues to be on target to open in 2010 and that at the end of this year, the Government will have delivered on its commitment to make a contribution of &euro;191 million towards the project.  Lansdowne will be a world-class stadium and a suitable national venue for major rugby and soccer games.</P>
        <P>Under the legislatively-based funding arrangements for the horse racing and greyhound sectors, the horse and greyhound fund would have expected an amount of approximately &euro;80 million for 2009.  However taking into account budgetary difficulties, an amount of almost &euro;70 million is being provided.  A review of the fund is currently under way in my Department.  The rationale of the fund has been that the horse and greyhound racing industries needed certainty in their funding support on a multi-annual basis and that such funding to develop the industries should be derived from the duty generated from off-course betting.  The increase in off-course betting tax from 1% to 2% will serve to significantly reduce, if not virtually eliminate in 2009, the amount of direct Exchequer subvention required.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The arts are a vibrant and vital sector of our economy, an important part of our community and the wellspring of many of our creative and innovative enterprises.  The arts are primary economic contributors, real businesses and enduring employers of more than 45,000 people.  Next year alone, my Department will invest approximately &euro;200 million in the arts and culture sector and creative industries.  In 2008 and 2009, combined investment by the Government in those sectors will be approximately &euro;450 million.  It is not too long ago since the Arts Council&rsquo;s annual allocation was one tenth of that sum.  That is real, tangible investment in the real economy, in real people and in real jobs.  It is also investment that enhances the productive and creative capacity of our country.</P>
        <P>The arts, cultural and creative sectors have achieved much in recent years.  Many museums and the National Library have won awards in recent years.  I will continue to allocate funds under the existing ACCESS programmes.  I hope to complete them in the next year.  Notwithstanding the difficult circumstances in which we find ourselves, we can still look forward to continued substantial investment, rightly so, in the tourism, arts and sport area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the budget debate.  I do so from the perspective of my position as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for equality, disability issues and mental health.</P>
        <P>I reassure people that even though we are in a tight budgetary situation the commitments given by the Government under the programme for Government and the multi-annual investment programme will be honoured.  While it is not relevant to recall what commitments have been delivered to date, nevertheless, it is important to remind the House of what has been achieved under the disability strategy in the multi-annual programme and to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to continue that strategy.</P>
        <P>I refer to the multi-annual investment programme in terms of the services provided to date and more importantly the funding for the future.  I will also deal with the EPSEN programme and clarify the matter contained in the budget statement regarding the efficiency saving of the 1% reduction in funding towards voluntary groups.</P>
        <P>To date, under the multi-annual programme 980 residential places have been secured, and 313 new respite places and 2,500 new day places were created.  I am the first to acknowledge that speaking about what happened in the past is not good enough in terms of what will happen in the future.  I reassure the House that I am not trying to make a big deal of the fact that we are announcing a &euro;20 million investment programme, &euro;10 million to the Department of Health and Children and &euro;10 million to the Department of Education and Science.  I recognise the huge demand on existing services.</P>
        <P>I reassure the House, as this issue has cropped up in recent debates, that the funding to which I refer will be ring-fenced specifically for use by the Department of Health and Children in the area of disability and mental health services.  There has been some negative comment suggesting funding approved by the Government for these services goes into what is often referred to as the HSE black hole.  I assure the House and those interested in this area that the &euro;10 million allocations for health and education will be used specifically to fund new posts.  Not alone is the funding ring-fenced but, more importantly, the positions agreed have been agreed with the HSE.  Unlike what happened last year, the advertisements for the recruitment of 125 additional therapy posts in the disability and mental health areas will begin immediately.  I do not say this to gloat over the &euro;20 million that has been allocated.  I am reasonably assured on this matter, but obviously the funding for the multi-annual programme is not in the package this year.</P>
        <P>The funding agreed will take into account the commitments made for education for persons with special needs.  Within the present budgetary constraints education for persons with special educational needs, EPSEN, cannot be funded.  However, the &euro;20 million allocated for therapy positions represent EPSEN under another name.  The benefit of this additional funding will include much needed therapy posts which will be allocated within the disability sector and will include speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists for children&rsquo;s disability services.</P>
        <P>I refer to the 35 additional posts for child and adolescent mental health services.  This will include clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and social workers.  There will be some new additions to the existing multidisciplinary teams and rather than have groups worrying about the commitment to ring-fencing funding, as was the case last year, staffing levels will remain intact.</P>
        <P>I refer to additional funding under the mental health budget allocation.  Some &euro;1.75 million has been allocated for suicide prevention.  Regrettably, the incidence of suicide is on the increase and the figures for this year will demonstrate this.  It is opportune, timely and proper <Col N="838"/>to further invest in suicide prevention and I look forward to an early meeting with Mr. Geoff Day of the National Suicide Prevention Office to discuss how we can optimise the level of spending in this area.</P>
        <P>The commitments under A Vision for Change must be speeded up.  We are moving from the old structure to the new community-based structures in psychiatric services.  This is typified by what is happening throughout the State with the new acute psychiatric units.  I commit, as I have previously, to beginning the process of meeting with the 12 psychiatric hospitals in the State.  We expect to have closure plans in place before the end of this year.  The funding secured from the sale of these properties will be ring-fenced.</P>
        <P>The efficiency saving of 1% in funding of non-statutory services requires clarification and I wish to allay fears that may exist concerning this funding.  Some &euro;1 billion goes towards the voluntary sector and non-statutory groups each year.  I have met with some of these groups in recent weeks.  I have assured them that I do not wish to force an amalgamation.  The proposal is an efficiency measure made in the hope that we can discuss the matter with these groups in the coming weeks and arrive at a conclusion where groups may share front-of-office facilities, back-up facilities or whatever else.  The important point is that we will, hopefully, secure the services of an independent chairperson who will examine the process of seeking the efficiency measure.  We will invite people from the disability and mental health services sectors to sit on the commission that will seek the efficiencies.  I have no difficulty backing up the statement that the process is about efficiency, not about reducing the level of commitment in that sector.  More important, it is not about forced amalgamations.  This will not be a dead of night process, it will be an open, transparent campaign where all the people involved will have the opportunity to provide input.  The relevant groups will receive support as they investigate the process of amalgamation.</P>
        <P>I refer to the estimated cost of implementing the recommendations in A Vision for Change.  I do so not in the context of taking funding from the disability sector or other support services in that area.  A Vision for Change proposed funding amounting to &euro;150 million for a seven to ten year programme.  It is dependent to a great extent on the re-modelling of the existing resources.  There is some doubt outside the House about how we can, on the one hand, commit to a change in the delivery of mental health services and, on the other hand, divide scarce resources in the budget.  I make the commitment that at present the HSE is preparing an audit value of the existing properties.  The process will be transparent.  The resulting figure will be completed by the end of this year.  The closure plans have now begun.  I called to the constituency of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle a fortnight ago and met with the staff of St. Senan&rsquo;s Hospital.  I am pleased to say to the House it has moved far more quickly than any other facility and has its closure plan agreed.  I intend with all the energy I possess to deliver similar closure plans with the help of the hospitals involved, as was the case with St. Senan&rsquo;s Hospital, and to return to the House early in the new year to explain how A Vision for Change can become a reality with the use of the assets.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>In working with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, there have been many challenges in the finalisation of the 2009 Estimates process in the areas for which I have responsibility.  Difficult choices on priorities for investment had to be made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.</P>
        <P>My areas of responsibility are lifelong learning across the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and social inclusion and <Col N="839"/>school transport in the Department of Education and Science.  I have responsibility for overseeing the effective co-ordination of lifelong learning across the two Departments.  In this capacity, I am the chair of the interdepartmental committee on the implementation of the national skills strategy.  This committee has responsibility for drafting and implementing a plan to realise the targets and objectives contained in the national skills strategy.  It is my intention that this plan will examine the existing provision of education and training to ensure a co-ordinated and efficient provision between the respective education and training sectors.  The implementation plan will also determine the key areas and initiatives that will require continued priority focus to achieve the objectives of the national skills strategy.  It is my intention that this implementation plan will be completed by early next year.</P>
        <P>It has been necessary to have a prioritised approach to the 2009 Estimates.  While the provision for further and adult education in 2009 shows a small increase on the outturn for 2008, nevertheless it will involve very careful management of the available resources and a reduction in the number of places being funded.  This reduction is of approximately 500 places in the back to education initiative, BTEI, and 100 places in senior traveller training centres and will mean the number of places in the BTEI returns to 2007 levels.  I shall endeavour in the context of the 2009 provision to safeguard the position of adult literacy, the vocational training opportunities scheme and Youthreach.  Allowances to participants in the vocational training opportunities scheme, the Youthreach scheme and the senior Traveller training centres will be increased in line with the appropriate social welfare rates or F&Aacute;S trainee allowances.  We will continue to provide over 30,000 places in the post-leaving certificate sector.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S and Skillnets, which are the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s two key training providers, have increased their focus on the provision of training to the low skilled in response to the national skills strategy.  As a result of the current economic difficulties, particularly the rising unemployment rate, the Government has prioritised the provision of the necessary support services to assist people who have been made redundant and are unemployed.  This focus, which will continue in 2009, will be a central part of the delivery of the vision outlined in the national skills strategy.  This lifelong learning objective is important.  I am pleased to note the three qualifications agencies are to merge as a single body.  This was one of the rationalisations of agencies announced in the budget.</P>
        <P>Since I was appointed as Minister of State in the Department of Education and Science, I have worked closely with the Further Education and Training Awards Council.  The council has been effective in developing a broad range of awards for all learners across further education and training.  It is responsible for levels 1 to 6 of the national framework of qualifications.  Progression arrangements are being enhanced by this set of new awards, together with the work of the Further Education and Training Awards Council.  The merging of the three organisations as a single agency will enhance the lifelong learning approach and ensure the benefits of the councils&rsquo; work over the past seven years will be realised.  The new organisation will build on the leading quality assurance role Ireland has played throughout Europe in the further education and training and higher education sectors.  Ireland has made a real difference on the international stage in this regard.  The qualifications bodies have ensured we play a lead role in policy development and implementation.  I am delighted the lifelong learning approach to qualifications and quality assurance, which is embodied in the national framework of qualifications, is fully reflected in a single strong agency that prioritises the needs of learners.</P>
        <P>The Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, action plan is the central element of the Department&rsquo;s social inclusion strategy, which promotes equality of educational opportunity for all.  A key part of the strategy involves focusing the additional resources which are available on the areas of greatest need.  Schools which have been identified as disadvantaged will continue to be fully supported.  When the DEIS initiative commenced, it provided for <Col N="840"/>concessionary measures, to last for the duration of the programme, whereby continuing funding would be provided to schools which were no longer classified as disadvantaged.  In prioritising expenditure in 2009, it is necessary to cease such concessionary measures.  This means that additional posts will be withdrawn from schools which were included in previous disadvantaged schemes but are not included in the DEIS initiative.  Similarly, the top-up capitation funding provided to such schools, as well as the dispersed disadvantage funding given to schools not included in DEIS, will be withdrawn.  This withdrawal is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in its 2006 report on primary disadvantage.  The office suggested a more focused approach to prioritising expenditure should be put in place.</P>
        <P>The 2009 Estimates recognise the importance of the school transport scheme in supporting school access and attendance, particularly in rural communities.  The Estimates provide for an increase of 12% in the 2009 allocation, when compared to the initial allocation for 2008.  This will enable the provision of school transport for over 136,000 children, including approximately 9,000 children with special needs.  The additional funding is particularly important in light of the increase in the number of children in schools, the establishment of new schools and the expanding number of children identified as having special educational needs.  I have prioritised funding for school transport to ensure their needs are met.  The increase also reflects some of the cost pressures which are relevant to school transport.  In particular, the allocation allows for a compensatory allowance to be paid to private contractors who can avail of a fuel rebate scheme until the end of this month.</P>
        <P>To meet current demands, payments of post-primary transport charges are being increased with effect from next summer.  A single payment of &euro;300 will be payable for each child.  The maximum individual family charge payable will increase to &euro;650.  Eligible children in families that have a medical card, or children with special needs, will continue to be exempt from the charges.  The single payment system is a new departure.  It will mean that planning can be undertaken more efficiently for a full school year by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It will ensure that concessionary transport will be confirmed on the basis of a full school year, rather than on a term-to-term basis.  I am aware the term-by-term allocation has caused difficulties for many children and their families.  Post-primary transport charges will meet approximately 20% of the cost of post-primary transport in 2009.</P>
        <P>Many difficult decisions have had to be made in considering the 2009 Estimates for my areas of responsibility.  A commitment has been demonstrated to prioritising investment in difficult economic circumstances.  I am confident the steps being taken will ensure the available resources are appropriately used to have the most effective impact in these areas.  They will provide for sustainability in the long run.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>My office, like the offices of all my colleagues in this House, has been inundated today with calls from people concerned about the impact of this budget on the over 70s.  Such people previously qualified for a medical card automatically, without a means test, but they are now subject to such a test.  As this day has gone on, we have learned more and more about the nasty aspects of this budget.  Perhaps the nastiest development was the posting this afternoon of a notice on the HSE website about the means testing for medical cards of people over the age of 70.  Up to now, such people were not means tested unless they had a spouse under the age of 70.  In such cases, the threshold for eligibility for a medical card <Col N="841"/>was set at &euro;596.50 for a couple.  That threshold has been halved for all people over the age of 70.  All couples over that age are now subject to a means test threshold of &euro;298 per couple.  The threshold for couples over the age of 70 has been halved, in effect.  The means test threshold for a single person over the age of 70 has been set at &euro;201.50.  If a single person of that age wants to get a full medical card, he or she must not have an income in excess of &euro;201.50.  The relevant threshold for a married couple is &euro;298.  That means, in effect, that a person with a relatively small occupational pension will be ineligible for a medical card.  This development is shocking and worrying for those in the over-70 age category.  I cannot emphasise enough the number of people who are concerned about this.  There is a real fear among elderly people that they will not be able to pay for their health charges.</P>
        <P>We got a lecture from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, yesterday.  He told us we should be patriotic.  The elderly people of this country, who have paid their taxes and worked hard over their lifetimes, often on small incomes, do not need a lecture on patriotism.  They need fair play and an opportunity to have their health care needs looked after at this stage in their lives.  It seems the opportunity they were given in that regard is to be taken from them, which is absolutely shocking.  The manner in which the means test for medical cards operated before now was relatively progressive.  The threshold for a single person under the age of 65 was &euro;164 and the threshold for a single person between the ages of 66 and 69 was &euro;173.50.  The threshold for a couple under the age of 65 was &euro;266.50 and the threshold for a couple between the ages of 65 and 69 was &euro;298.  The threshold for a couple between the ages of 70 and 79 was &euro;598.50 and the threshold for a couple over the age of 80 was &euro;627.  That progression has gone completely.  The threshold for those over the age of 70 has been reduced to the level applying to those between the ages of 66 and 69.  This nasty little piece of work has been revealed on the HSE website.  It was not announced in this Chamber by the Minister for Health and Children when she spoke earlier in this debate.  It is a huge cause for worry among elderly people throughout the community.</P>
        <P>People are concerned that they will not be able to pay for their medical treatment.  Deputy Hoctor is the Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, but I am not sure if she is aware that the means test has been slashed in this way.  The threshold has been halved, where previously it was &euro;596.50 for a couple.  This puts fear into the hearts of people who are concerned for their health and it makes them wonder whether they will be able to get the kind of treatment they need.  We know that elderly people need to go to the doctor regularly and that it was a great comfort to them when the free medical card was introduced.  There were arguments about it at the time, and our party expressed concerns about introducing for everybody, regardless of income.  However, it was introduced a year before a general election in order to win that election, but was taken away a year after another general election.  That is highly cynical and damaging to the people concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>My party leader raised a point this morning about people who gave up their voluntary health insurance because they felt they did not need it following the introduction of free medical cards.  Those people are now trying to go back into an insurance system in order to cover health costs.  The point made this morning was that if people had an existing condition, then they would not be covered for a number of years if they went back into a voluntary health insurance scheme.  Since risk equalisation has been struck down by the courts, elderly people who broke their insurance cover and who wish to go back are in a very uncertain situation.</P>
        <P>I want to address some of the other issues that relate to health in this budget, especially the charges that have been introduced.  The increase from &euro;66 to &euro;100 for a visit to an accident <Col N="842"/>and emergency department is a huge burden on people who are sick.  When Fianna F&aacute;il went into Government back in 1997, that charge was &pound;12, so there has been an 800% increase.  There have been increases in charges for hospital beds.  The threshold for the drug repayment scheme has been raised to &euro;100 per month per family, which is up from &euro;90.  These charges impose huge hardship on families.</P>
        <P>The reason the health sector is suffering these increased charges, which are estimated to come to &euro;100 million, is largely due to the complete failure to reform the health services.  When the HSE was formed in January 2005, the Minister stated that it would provide efficiencies, save money, cut down on administration and provide funds for the patient at the coal face.  It has done precisely the opposite and the Minister for Finance admitted yesterday that there has been an increase of 1,900 administrative staff since it was set up.  That is hardly a reduction in the burden of administration.  The formation of the HSE was rushed for political reasons so that it could be put in place by 1 January 2005, but it was destined to fail.  It was designed simply to stick 11 health boards together and put another layer on top.  It was designed to be a centralised dinosaur, with very little power to make decisions at the patient level.  As a result of that, it has understandably failed to work.  There has been an increase in the budget, but the money has not produced any better results for patients.  Bureaucracy has been increased and has made it difficult for people who are directly looking after patients to make decisions in the interests of those patients.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party put forward a plan on how the HSE should be reformed.  I am glad to see that a little bit of it is being taken on board, as there is an effort to thin out the layers of administration at the higher levels.  However, we really need more power for those who are directly working with the patients so that they can control their budgets and decide how those budgets are spent.  That has not happened.  As a result of the lack of reform, there has instead been a chopping at the edge of the budgets, which will only hurt the patients.  It has been admitted that services to patients will be affected by this.  The 2% increase given to the HSE will not enable it to cope with the extra demand or with wage agreements that have already been signed.  Nor will it enable the HSE to cope with consultants&rsquo; payments, which have also been increased by agreement.  It will not deal with medical inflation, which is probably higher than general inflation.</P>
        <P>This winter, we will see more people on trolleys and waiting lists.  The Taoiseach made the point this morning that those over 70 who are to lose their medical cards will be all right because they are entitled to free care in the hospitals.  They will be so entitled, but how long will they have to wait?  We all remember Susie Long, who died on a waiting list because she was a public patient.  Are the people who are now losing their medical cards going to have to wait on lists that will grow longer?  I understand that health workers in the north east have already been told that their budgets will be cut back by 10-12% in hospitals, and we all know what is going on in Drogheda at the moment.</P>
        <P>The health sector has been deeply damaged by this budget, and the vulnerable people in our society, the old, the sick and the disabled are those who will suffer most.  They are taking the brunt of it and that is not how it should be.  We were told in this budget that the Government was going to protect the vulnerable, but it has done everything except protect the vulnerable.  The Government has exposed people to worries that they might not be able to look after themselves when sick.</P>
        <P>The leader of Fine Gael raised the issue of the &ldquo;fair deal&rdquo; and the ability for someone to offset health expenses against tax.  The reply was that it would not come in at the lower rate until the fair deal was in place, so things were fine because people would be covered by it.  However, we need to read the small print of the fair deal.  To qualify for the fair deal, one has <Col N="843"/>to be assessed as being in a state of maximum dependancy.  There are many elderly people who have to leave acute hospitals and go to nursing homes because they do not have enough support to go home, but who are classified as being of medium dependency.  From reading the legislation on the fair deal, I believe that such people will not qualify on the basis of the medical assessment.  I accept that there is a social assessment as well, but I have no doubt that many in nursing homes will not qualify for this new scheme.  Therefore, the families of those people will be affected by the change in the rate of tax that can be written off against medical expenses and expenses for long-term care.</P>
        <P>There are many aspects to the budget that will affect sick people.  It is a very sorry day for the health services.  It will take a long time to recover, yet we still do not know what allocation the HSE will get next year.  I have no doubt those figures will have a serious impact on health services in hospitals and in the community. I support the Government&rsquo;s wish that where possible people should be cared for in their own community.  I predict we will see cuts in home help hours and in the many other kinds of home supports needed if people are to stay out of hospital.</P>
        <P>This is a sorry day for the health services.  I wished to highlight the manner in which the over-70s have been treated and how they will now be means tested for medical cards.  Many of them are very worried tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>Most of the points about the health effects of this budget have been well covered by my colleagues.  They highlighted how the budget has imposed numerous stealth taxes and cuts.  Deputy Shortall has outlined the so-called treacherous 30.  A rational analysis of this budget would leave one in no doubt but that every single citizen will be adversely affected.  The Taoiseach yesterday called the nation to patriotic action.  In a later deposition, for want of a better word, the Taoiseach stated this Government is predicated on a philosophy of republican egalitarianism.  When the Minister for Finance finished his speech yesterday and the backbenchers rose to applaud him, I thought they were going to spontaneously burst into a rendition of &ldquo;Wrap the Green Flag Round Me&rdquo;.  From where I stand as a republican and as somebody who subscribes to those republican ideals and those ideals of egalitarianism, this budget is far from that.  If I was an elderly person today, or if I was somebody who was surviving on a low income or if I was unemployed and I was seeking some solace from this budget, none would be found.  There is nothing in this budget that covers those people who would subscribe to those same ideals, namely, every single citizen.</P>
        <P>If it was an egalitarian budget, it would not have introduced a levy of 1% on all income.  If we subscribe to the notion that taxation must be equitable and fair and it must abide by the canons of taxation, then the tax rates would have been increased and the Minister would not have increased taxation on all income.  I wish to nail the lie that this is somehow a progressive measure.  What it seeks to do is further decrease take-home pay and real income.  The people most affected will be those on the margins or in the low-income bracket.  If this is coupled with the increases in stamp duty, the increased charges for third level registration, increases in VAT and in DIRT, no matter what way, such people will be caught on all sides.  These are not the actions of a Government that cares about levelling taxation in a truly egalitarian manner.</P>
        <P>I had a call today from a lady from Cloyne in my constituency of Cork East.  This lady is married, there are two incomes coming into the family and she has four children.  This is a person who is rational in her assessment of the current climate.  She and her husband have lived through the 1970s and 1980s and had begun to raise a family in those times when her husband and herself were paying 50 pence in the pound and possibly more in taxation.  She has a 22-year old son and she is now actively encouraging him to emigrate.  She told me she can see no hope for him in the present climate in this country.  She is telling him his best chance of <Col N="844"/>getting a good job and surviving in this world would be to get out of here.  There is nothing that she could see in the current climate that would give her or her family any hope.  She told me that her husband is near retirement age and that they both worked hard for every single penny they earned.  They never asked for anything from the State.  They never had medical cards.  They paid the high rates of tax in the 1970s and 1980s.  They sent their kids to college but they never qualified for third level grants.  That family is representative of thousands of families who today will have to pay the price of the profligacy of the past seven or eight years.  They will have to pay the cost of that deficit of approximately &euro;12 billion, if the figures are to be believed.  As her public representative, what am I to say to her to give her any hope for the future?  I do not blame her for the cynicism that she expresses about the political system.  When I hear the Government wrapping the language of this budget in patriotic fervour and republican egalitarianism, it sticks in my craw a little bit.  The Government, notwithstanding the external forces we hear so much about, must take some level of political responsibility.  If we were on that side of the House, we would have to take political responsibility if the cards were stacked in the same way.  This is what the people want, particularly those who are on low to middle incomes.  They do not want always to be forced to pay the price of Government profligacy.  This is not what they have subscribed to.  They are, by their nature, always PAYE workers and they are the people that work the hardest, put their children through college and do not expect a lot from the State but they do not expect to be punished by the State either and that is what this budget has done to those people.  If we are talking about egalitarianism and about equity in the system, then I call on the Government to reverse some of those measures to at least release the real income or let them claw back some of that real income they have lost through these measures.  This would be equitable and fair and there would be a greater share of the burden of responsibility.  As a high-income earner, I would be happy to take on a greater burden if necessary.</P>
        <P>It is often said that the true mark of an egalitarian society is how older people are treated.  This budget has clawed back the medical card for the over-70s and this is nothing short of a disgrace.  I will not use superlatives or come out with a soundbite but it is unfair on those people.  We had created expectations and put in place a system that people had become familiar with.  When they came to the autumn years of their lives they had the peace of mind of knowing they could go to the GP when they wanted to and had that little entitlement when inflation and the cost of living were increasing.  They no longer have that little cushion.  I call on the Government to reverse that as an egalitarian and truly republican measure.  If the Government subscribes to those ideals it will reverse this measure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Listening to Deputy Sherlock speak and recalling how the Government tried to wrap the green flag around itself one is reminded that &ldquo;patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.&rdquo;  This Government has behaved like a scoundrel.  Over the past couple of days we have had an example of what happens when the entire future of a country is invested in a pyramid scheme.  The Government invested everybody&rsquo;s hopes, aspirations and financial future in a housing bubble.  Like every other pyramid scheme, that bubble collapsed, leaving ordinary people, as with every financial rip-off, carrying the can.  I would like to talk about some of those people, but before I do that I will digress.</P>
        <P>A couple of years ago I heard an old Chinese fable and I could not make sense of it until the past couple of days.  It is about a scorpion during a flood seeking a lift across a river from a frog.  The frog refuses, saying if he lets the scorpion on to his back the scorpion will sting and kill him.  The scorpion replies that if he does that they will both drown in the river.  The frog sees the logic, allows the scorpion on to his back and sets off across the river.  Half way across the scorpion stings the frog and they both begin to drown.  When the frog asks the scorpion <Col N="845"/>why he did it, the scorpion replies that it is in his nature and he cannot help it.  Such is the type of Government we get from Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is in the party&rsquo;s nature and it cannot help it.  Fianna F&aacute;il cannot help ripping off the small guy and looking after the developers.  While the Galway Races tent is packed up in a Barna shed somewhere, the mentality is still alive.</P>
        <P>The Government told the public it was mending the roof and the country.  That is easy to do when the sun is shining.  When it started to rain we found out it was doing nothing.  I looked at the Visitors Gallery today and saw 18 year old children.  For the past 18 years those children have been coming here and they would have seen a remarkable change in our country.  Where are they?  A child born in 1989 is no better off in 2008 because, as Deputy Shortall pointed out today, developments such as third level education are being undermined.  The children&rsquo;s allowance that allows children to continue in the education system has been taken away.  Even illness benefit for a child is not paid until he or she is 18 years old.  Undermining, undermining, undermining.  One must ask why, when there is a downturn in the economy, one which was signalled for a number of years, the most vulnerable and the weakest are the first to be hit.  How does it make sense that taking a medical card from a 70 year old or an 80 year old will give somebody a job sooner?  It will not provide a single job.</P>
        <P>Before the budget, the Labour Party gave the Government a road map because this budget has no strategy.  We needed a budget that would create a job strategy with managing public finances.  This budget has done neither.  We should have got a very clear strategy that would have given the public confidence that there is a way out of the morass it caused.  The Government can blame international finances until the cows come home, but with its buddies it created this property bubble, and it has fallen on top of all of us.  The Government could have redirected or restimulated the housing sector and the Labour Party put forward many options.  It could have provided educational and training options for people who are losing their jobs.  It could have made the social welfare system more flexible so that people are not waiting for 12 or 18 months to requalify to return to employment options.</P>
        <P>Last Saturday morning I heard the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, trying to pretend he is Roosevelt, talking about a &ldquo;new deal&rdquo; and saying we have nothing to fear but fear itself.  To use a Roosevelt term, he has pulled the social contract out from under people in this country.  People who have been paying social welfare contributions find from this morning they have to pay twice the contributions they paid yesterday and they are entitled to only half the benefit.  For the past ten years we have had developer-led Government.  What we need is Government-led development.  That is an entirely different concept.  Like the scorpion on the frog&rsquo;s back, we will never get Government-led development from Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; mise ag roinnt mo chuid ama leis an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Curran.  Time and again the Opposition states the money was wasted in the past ten years, but the record is very different.  In the past ten years we reduced the national debt, which was extraordinarily high after the 1983-87 coalition of Fine Gael and Labour.  We dramatically reduced that until we had the lowest debt to GDP ratio among Europe 15, other than Luxembourg.  We went further.  We put a huge amount of money into the pension reserve fund, putting money aside for the future because we were aware that the rate at which money was coming into the Exchequer could not continue indefinitely.  We put money aside for the rainy day.  We spent money on improving services.  In every school in the country one can find a large number of staff who would not have been there five, ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  I remember when a three-teacher school was literally a three-teacher school.  There was no support or ancillary staff.  That has all changed dramatically.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We are involved in the greatest ever investment in infrastructure in this country.  When we came to power &euro;320 million was being spent on national roads.  The budget for 2009 is &euro;1.9 billion.  We were spending something paltry like &euro;12 million on railways, but now we are making major investment in light and heavy rail throughout the country.  We have provided our citizens with one of the best social welfare systems and pension rates anywhere in the developed world.  Anybody who is used to dealing with people from other jurisdictions, when he or she examines what people get, realises how good our social welfare system is.  That is where the money was spent and if that is what the Opposition Members consider wasting money, let them stand on their record.  We were right to invest the money in these different ways and it was prudent.</P>
        <P>I also recognise this budget was difficult for people.  In the past ten years we have had the luxury of unprecedented economic growth.  Year after year on budget day we could give more and more and were always able to give more than we took away.  However, no matter how high the mountain, people want to go one step higher.  It is a human desire.  Therefore, I fully accept it was a shock to people this year that in the difficult budget we had to announce yesterday we had to ask the taxpayer for more than we could give.  That was necessary to protect into the long-term, distant future the quality of the services we have developed and, particularly, to protect the vulnerable.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is trying to create a fear factor.</P>
        <P>Virtually all reputable economists agree it was necessary for us to take the steps we took to consolidate the gains we have made and to make sure they last into the future.  However, when one examines all the decisions made collectively, it is clear there were a number of basic aims.  The first was to protect those on social welfare, with a &euro;500 million package.  The second was to protect those on lower incomes by putting a greater proportion of the burden on those with higher incomes while at the same time not creating a disincentive for employment and development.  The third aim was to continue with the vast majority of the investment outlined in the national development plan, including in schools and our road and rail networks.</P>
        <P>There are those who believe all our problems can be solved by reductions in cost of the public service.  Indeed, the Government has built in significant savings in the cost of the public service for next year.  However, it is insulting and grossly inaccurate for people to infer that most public service workers are either unproductive or underemployed.  Having worked with public servants for many years I wish to state that my experience has been that many of them go way beyond the call of duty.  Any time I have asked public servants to attend meetings at night, they have done so without question and with no additional remuneration.  Of course there are people in the public service who do not deliver but that is true in all situations where thousands are employed.  There will always be a few who are not pulling their weight.  However, I have met many public servants who go way beyond the call of duty and who more than make up for those who might be less than productive.</P><Col N="847"/>
        <P>The Government is making radical changes and I have announced a number in my own Department.  There is no question that all of us can create efficiencies.  In the past three years I have set about amalgamating the Leader and partnership companies.  It was a slow process and I thank some Opposition Deputies for their enormous support in this regard.  The amalgamation was necessary because there was duplication of effort between the two organisations.  Likewise, I amalgamated Bord na Gaeilge with Foras na Gaeilge because there was no need for a free-standing board in that case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have no doubt that in the coming months, however, as decisions are made by the Government and put into action in the wider public service, despite present calls for even more radical action, we will be inundated with representations from Opposition Deputies to preserve the jobs and conditions of employment of those in the public service.  I hope I am wrong and that the Opposition shows consistency in this case and supports the necessary measures we will take to ensure we have the best public service in the world.</P>
        <P>There has been a well-orchestrated campaign in the last few weeks to convince people that decentralisation is at an end, with references by the Labour Party to phantom civil servants and so forth.  Even last night, certain media headlines were claiming the programme had been abandoned.  Like Mark Twain, the rumours of the demise of decentralisation were greatly exaggerated and the facts speak for themselves.  To date, 2,500 people have already decentralised and progress will be made immediately with the decentralisation of another 3,500 people, making this by far the most ambitious decentralisation programme ever, with the headquarters of numerous Departments relocating to various parts of the country.</P>
        <P>I recognise we have deferred the relocation of the final 4,000 posts for reconsideration in 2011.  In the current circumstances, this was a wise decision.  However, this should not detract from what has been achieved and the benefits it has brought to many communities around the country.  It is interesting to note that one of the happiest campers in the D&aacute;il yesterday evening was an Opposition Deputy who has seen at first hand the benefits of decentralisation, not too far from Deputy Devins&rsquo;s part of the world.

        <P>It is amazing how people forget the way it was in the past.  When I came into the Department in 1997, the total capital allocation for the islands was &euro;1 million.  This year, despite a slight decrease, it is &euro;25 million.  In 2003, the budget of the Department was less than half of what it is today.  There will not be as much money available next year and there will be a small reduction.  However, when it is put in the context of how far we have gone so fast, I believe with careful management of the money we can achieve great benefits next year.</P>
        <P>The rural development programme to be announced in the coming weeks will be the largest rural development programme ever and will involve an investment of &euro;425 million.  It will be almost three times the size of the programme which ran from 2000 to 2006.  The programme will be rolled out between 2009 and 2013.  Within this programme are major opportunities for people to develop rural areas and overcome some of the challenges they face at present.</P>
        <P>As Minister, I will continue to focus on urban deprivation in which we face major challenges, some financial and some social.  I will continue to make a major commitment in time and effort to the RAPID programme which is slowly but surely acquiring the confidence of the people in the communities affected.  We will continue to roll out the programme as vigorously as ever. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has always been focused on helping disadvantaged people by supporting communities throughout the country.  This disadvantage, whether in urban or rural areas, can come in a range of forms from social exclusion to communities damaged by drugs problems.</P>
        <P>I remain committed to the local development social inclusion programme and the community development programme and to the communities they serve. The range of social inclusion programmes, including the local development social inclusion and the community development programme have made a considerable contribution to the tasks of countering disadvantage and in promoting equality and social and economic inclusion.</P>
        <P>The high numbers of communities and individuals supported by the programmes since their inception is the result of the hard work, commitment and co-operation not only of the personnel of partnerships but of the boards of partnerships and the boards of the community development projects and their inclusive representation in many cases from the State, social partners, elected representatives and, perhaps most important of all, the community sector.  The key to the success of many social inclusion programmes is due in no small part to the input and commitment from individuals and community groups from all over the country.</P>
        <P>Active citizenship is the key to success with each resident considering what he or she can do to bring about the changes needed to access opportunities and to enhance community life.  This is at the core of the principle underpinning all social inclusion programmes and initiatives.  Community and voluntary activity is at the centre of a vibrant and inclusive society and the <Col N="850"/>Government recognizes the invaluable role it plays.  The Government is committed to the principles underpinning the relationship between the State and the sector as set out in the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity, as well as taking on board the work of the task force on active citizenship.  By building on our experience of community consultation and participation, we can continue to improve the delivery of necessary supports to local communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, in a vastly altered and ever-changing economic and social environment, the concept and reality of &ldquo;community&rdquo; are not what they were when this and other programmes started out.  Our society, our family unit and by extension, our communities are now much more diverse.  Programmes such as this, need to adapt to this new diversity and to new and emerging trends in as full and inclusive a way as possible.  In the current economic environment, there is an ongoing need to ensure that resources are directed in a targeted and effective manner and that we constantly subject our activities to critical appraisal.  In this way we can continue to ensure that those we work to assist will receive the maximum benefit.</P>
        <P>I pay a special tribute to the countless volunteer members of local boards of management of community projects.  Often working with limited resources, they put in many hours of voluntary effort for the good of the people in their neighbourhoods.  We need to cherish the values that inform and drive those who have taken upon themselves the responsibility for the development of their community, their locality, and the promotion of social inclusion.  We are entering a difficult period, but with prudent management of our scarce resources, I look forward with confidence to the further successes that the local and community development programmes will bring over the next year.</P>
        <P>There will be continued support for the elderly through the community support to older people scheme.  This scheme has been successful in supporting community groups to provide essential security items for older people living at home.  Funds are made available for socially monitored alarms; smoke alarms; door and window security; emergency external lighting and a range of other personal security equipment.  Last week, I was in Kerry where Muintir na T&iacute;re held a community awareness week.  I was asked about the scheme and I stated the scheme of grants in place would remain in place.  It could easily have been withdrawn but I have seen its benefits first hand.</P>
        <P>I have increased the provision to &euro;3.5 million for 2009 in line with the level of demand evident in recent years.  This scheme is modest in the overall context of the budget and even in the context of the broad range of funding provided for the community and voluntary sector.  However, it is one area that clearly delivers front line services to those older people in our urban and rural communities most in need of reassurances and protection in their homes.</P>
        <P>My Department, through its funding to voluntary and community groups, also supports a growing variety of opportunities for citizens to get involved in a task or organisation that appeals to them.  Yesterday, I had a very useful discussion in the Seanad on the role of volunteering in Ireland.  During this discussion, the immense contribution of volunteers to society was highlighted on all sides of the House.</P>
        <P>I recently attended a number of &ldquo;Give It A Swirl Day&rdquo; events, an initiative promoted by Volunteer Centres Ireland through its members around the country, and it is a great example of an innovative approach to encouraging people of all ages and from all walks of life, individuals, families, community groups and businesses, to get involved for just a few hours, in a hands-on volunteer project in their local community.  The events held throughout the country include activities such as community clean-ups, tree planting, decorating homes for the elderly and painting murals.  Other initiatives assist sporting organisations like the GAA to develop <Col N="851"/>opportunities for volunteers in local clubs and to engage with other voluntary groups to achieve wider community objectives.</P>
        <P>This network of volunteer centres across the country is funded by my Department and now provides annual funding of approximately &euro;2.5 million to 20 such centres located throughout the country.  So far this year, these volunteer centres have registered more than 5,660 volunteers and more than 800 volunteer-involving organisations.  It should also be noted that 56% of registered volunteers had never volunteered before and 70% are aged 35 years and under.  We often roll out new initiatives and let them off.  However, we took the view in the Department that this initiative needs to be critically monitored and evaluated from an early stage to achieve best practice, high standards and the roll-out of volunteer centres on a national basis.</P>
        <P>I am aware that in the current economic climate difficult decisions need to be made and compromise is required.  However, this does not signal in any way an end to progress in the implementation of the national drugs strategy.  Rather, it means that all involved will have to continue to build on the progress made to date and be innovative in our response to the ever-changing patterns of drug misuse.</P>
        <P>The partnership approach, which underpins the strategy, involves statutory agencies working together with the community and voluntary sectors to combat the problems associated with substance misuse in our communities.  Collaboration, a key element in our achievements so far, has made a significant contribution to the roll-out and effective running of drugs programmes.  I am confident that together we can continue to build on these achievements.</P>
        <P>Investment is set to continue and over &euro;61 million has been allocated in the Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2009.  However, this represents only part of an overall allocation of over &euro;200 million, provided by the Government across several Departments and agencies, to tackle the drugs problem this year.  As I keep pointing out, tackling drug misuse requires a multi-agency, partnership approach and we must not lose sight of this with the publication of the 2009 Estimates.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs does not work in isolation and the Government is continuing to invest in the drugs strategy across the relevant Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>Funding from my Department is provided annually for the projects operating in the local and regional drugs taskforce areas under their respective plans, including those under the emerging needs fund.  Funding will continue in 2009 for projects targeting services for particular communities and areas of need ranging from treatment, rehabilitation and prevention to supply reduction, education and research.  In 2009, funding will also continue to be targeted at initiatives introduced in 2008.  This will cover new responses to cocaine misuse across the taskforce areas.  It will also cover measures to strengthen and deepen existing cocaine specific projects, as well as others aimed at polydrug-cocaine use in taskforce areas.  Cocaine remains a significant problem that touches all levels of society but has a disproportionate effect on areas of disadvantage.  I am delighted, therefore, that my Department is investing in this initiative.</P>
        <P>I am also making funding available in 2009 under the rehabilitation initiative introduced in 2008.  This measure, which is also taskforce led, will assist recovering drug misusers to regain their capacity for daily life, allowing them to reintegrate into their families and communities and begin to lead more meaningful lives again.  It also represents a step towards the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the working group on drugs rehabilitation, published last year.  It made a series of recommendations for the development of a comprehensive rehabilitation pillar under the drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive will take the lead role in the implementation of these recommendations.  A national drugs rehabilitation implementation committee is in the process of being put in place to dovetail with the appointment by the Health Service Executive of a senior <Col N="852"/>rehabilitation co-ordinator who will chair it.  The first meeting of the committee will be held on 6 November.  It is envisaged the working group recommendations will be implemented over several years, depending in part on the funding available.</P>
        <P>With regard to the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, my Department is progressing arrangements to transfer the functions and duties relating to the fund to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The fund&rsquo;s integration into that office will provide a cohesive and comprehensive response to the needs of all young people, including those at risk of drug misuse.</P>
        <P>My Department has also addressed the needs of young people in the areas not covered by the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund.  Under the regional youth initiative, capital funding of over &euro;2 million will be provided for the development of 16 dedicated youth facilities where the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund does not operate.</P>
        <P>My Department has also made provision in 2009 for the valuable work of the national advisory committee on drugs, the research arm of the drugs strategy.  I expect to continue to provide a grant to support the work of the national drug documentation centre which operates under the aegis of the alcohol and drug research unit of the Health Research Board.</P>
        <P>The period covered by the current national drugs strategy comes to a close at the end of this year.  My Department, aided by a steering group made up of representatives of the various interested parties, is working on the development of the new strategy for 2009 to 2016.  It is vital to get the new strategy right and to have relevant targets, demanding but achievable, with the optimum structures in place to facilitate their implementation.</P>
        <P>While I am aware of the current economic climate, I intend to strive to ensure that as many as possible of the concerns voiced during the comprehensive consultation process undertaken by my Department, particularly at the 15 public meetings held around the country, are taken on board.  I will also be placing great emphasis on ensuring that addressing the problem of substance misuse remains a priority for all key Departments and agencies involved in the delivery of the new strategy, which I hope to launch in early 2009.</P>
        <P>While recognising that reduced funding is available to my Department, it is my objective to ensure maximum funding is directed to frontline services.  To achieve this, my Department will not be entering into new contracts to provide support services to community development projects.  These supports will now be provided directly by staff in my Department.  Further efficiencies will be achieved by reducing our Department&rsquo;s dependence on the use of outside agencies.  Specifically some work being carried out by Pobal on behalf of the Department will revert to the Department.  Maximum funding will be provided to frontline services such as partnerships, community development programmes and drugs taskforces.  Savings will be made in administration through the Department.</P>

	<P>This is a rough budget.  It is rough on the vulnerable, the poor, children, their parents and teachers.  It is particularly rough on the elderly where many of the supports they had come to rely on are being removed without notice.  It is also rough in its construction, showing all the signs of a hastily produced document.  Many Ministers, even those with a certain competence in economic matters, were not able to explain details of the budget in either last night&rsquo;s or today&rsquo;s debates on the financial resolutions.  There have been four different explanations as to how nursing home fees will be treated for tax purposes in the <Col N="853"/>future, with no satisfactory explanation yet.  In the late afternoon, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, was forced to back down on the 2% health levy which would now apply to the over 70s who are no longer exempt because they possess a medical card.  It is a rough budget in every respect.</P>
        <P>One reason it is rough is that its date was conceived as a public relations stunt.  There is very little in it which will come into effect until 1 January 2009.  There was no reason, therefore, for bringing the date forward.  We could easily be debating this budget in the first week in December and it would make no difference to the fiscal position.  However, after a period of inactivity since the Taoiseach was elected and throughout the summer, the Government needed to show it was in charge, in command, busy about the nation&rsquo;s business.  So we had this public relations stroke to bring the budget forward.  The stroke went sour because the budget date more or less coincided with both the domestic and international financial and banking crises.  That must have put enormous pressure on the key officials, particularly those in the Department of Finance, and the key Ministers.  As a consequence, we have had a roughly hewn document which was not subjected to the normal proofing and scrutiny that would apply if the budget was delivered at the normal time.</P>
        <P>Another problem with the budget, which is based on a fallacy, is the suggestion that somehow or other the crisis is connected to the banking and financial crisis, which it is not.  If the banks were as sound as the Bank of Ireland used to be in the olden days and if there was no problem in any international bank and no liquidity or credit problems anywhere in the world, Ireland would still have a major fiscal problem because revenue receipts no longer match expenditure and the gap is widening.  It is a separate matter, yet Ministers have tried to wrap both issues together.  They have tried to excuse their incompetence over the years by pretending that this budget and the problems it deems to address were a by-product of a wider financial crisis.  They are not.  This is a stand-alone crisis.</P>
        <P>Another fallacy is that nobody saw this coming and that suddenly, in July, the ground opened under Ministers&rsquo; feet and they had to introduce emergency measures before the summer recess, cutting expenditure by &euro;400 million to balance the books for 2008.  There was another cataclysm after the summer when they saw things were going wrong for 2009 so they had to advance the budget date.  That is all bogus, however, because this situation was well flagged.  It was flagged in this House and by economists.  The then Minister for Finance, who is now the Taoiseach, did not take action because he had a political agenda within the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  He did not want to be the Minister for Finance who had to deal with these issues, but the issue was there over 12 months ago.  When the former Minister for Finance came into this House on 27 June 2007 and introduced the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2007, we told him there was an emerging deficit that needed to be bridged.  The Bill contained the paltry measures he took on stamp duty after the election.  I stood here on that day and saw the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, sitting beside the then Minister for Finance.  I told him that the figures from the Cental Statistics Office were out and that housing starts for each month from the start of the year were down dramatically.  As night follows day, if housing starts are down in 2007, housing completions will be down in 2008.  I told him, and he knew, the rule of thumb was that for every 10,000 fewer housing completions, &euro;1 billion less comes into the Exchequer.  The figure was falling from 90,000 houses and was heading down to approximately 45,000.  It is heading down to 25,000 for 2009.  The Minister of State can do the calculations for himself.</P>
        <P>I asked the former Minister for Finance to introduce a White Paper in the autumn to show how he would bridge the emerging fiscal deficit.  In his reply, he dismissed me in the way he always treats intellectual inferiors.  Of course, that would not upset anyone because in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s world everybody from the Fastnet to the Cliffs of Moher and up to the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway is an intellectual inferior so we were part of a fairly large group.  The Taoiseach <Col N="854"/>knew, however.  He is shrewd and understands finances.  He knew what I and other Deputies were talking about, but he chose not to deal with it because he was running a different political agenda.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like all Ministers for Finance, the current Minister had three choices to bridge the gap between receipts and expenditure.  He could tax, borrow or cut expenditure, and they are all connected.  In my view and that of many people outside this House, he is borrowing and taxing too much, while not cutting enough.  It is as simple as that.  One may ask where the Minister could make more cuts, but what he is doing now is unsustainable because he is driving the country further into recession.  There is no chance that we can tax, cut and borrow our way out of this problem.  The only way out of this problem is to grow our way out of it.  As the country goes back on a growth path, the revenue will be yielded once more that will match the expenditure we desire to make.  That is the only way out of this.  It was the only way out of it in the 1980s and it is the lesson of the 1990s.  Unless we get the country back on that growth path again we will have no chance.  Instead of going back on that growth path, however, the Minister is making things worse.  In simple economic terms, if one takes &euro;2 billion of spending power, which is the tax imposition of this budget, out of consumers&rsquo; pockets and transfers it to the Government, there is a problem.  That money will not be spent by consumers, which will deepen the recession.  That is the difficulty the Minister is facing.</P>
        <P>We had two phases of the Celtic tiger.  The first phase was the genuine Irish fairy story, the real success story, whereby the model was based on a competitive society.  Labour costs were low, there was great output and productivity by Irish workers and the cost of utilities and other facilities was competitive.  We had export-led growth and were successful in manufacturing industry and internationally traded services.  Our employment rate increased from about 1.1 million to over 2 million.</P>
        <P>We then had the false model whereby we became uncompetitive and the Government drove the country by over-stimulating the building industry.  That bubble has now burst so we must get back to the path of growth, which yielded results in revenue, employment and living standards which we all enjoyed.  Without a strategy for growth, however, we will go nowhere.  There is no such strategy in this budget, apart from one item, an increase in the provision for research and development in industry, whereby the tax credit goes from 20% to 25%.  That is welcome but it stands out like a lighthouse in a bog as the single item to encourage industry back to the path of the 1990s when we had a really competitive economy based on internationally traded goods and services.  That is where we have to get back to, but we are not going there with this budget.  Far too much &mdash; &euro;2 billion &mdash; is being raised in taxes and there is far too much borrowing.  The borrowing levels are frightening.  Over 16 months the position has deteriorated by about &euro;20 billion, which is scary.  Just because the Minister receives a standing ovation for introducing a budget, it does not mean the trajectory is stopping.</P>
        <P>The trend is downwards, while borrowing is rising, but the budget will not stop it.  It collects &euro;2 billion extra and gives the Minister permission to borrow, but he will be borrowing about &euro;12.5 billion in 2009.  This is crazy stuff.  The GDP-debt ratio was approximately 25% this year and it will be 43% next year, which is some jump.  The year after it will get worse.  Anybody on the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenches who thinks this is a once-off story should think again.  For reference, they might examine the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech this morning in which he stated that he wants to:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0" el="5">establish a long-term sustainable path, whereby day-to-day expenditure corresponds to tax receipts.  As tax revenues are 10% less than expected for this year, with little improvement in that position assumed for next year, that can only be done progressively over time.</P><Col N="855"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Taoiseach wants to bring the budget back into balance and suggests he will do so by taxing, making up the 10% gap by further taxes.  It is in his speech that we will not have this big gap forever, but that is for the lads in Europe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has the highest rate of cystic fibrosis in the world and one of the lowest life expectancy rates for cystic fibrosis patients.  While there is no official data on life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland, it is clear that we lag behind many other developed countries in life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients.</P>
        <P>In an effort to change this, family and friends of cystic fibrosis patients in Cork and Kerry founded a group called Build4Life.  The aim of Build4Life is to raise awareness of cystic fibrosis in the region and to raise over &euro;1 million for a dedicated adult cystic fibrosis treatment unit at Cork University Hospital.  I am pleased to say that after an enormous amount of voluntary effort, the Build4Life campaign has already raised over &euro;1.3 million.</P>
        <P>A statement of need for the provision of these dedicated cystic facilities has been passed by the executive management board at Cork University Hospital, and it is now up to the Health Service Executive to progress the project.  It is expected there will be 150 adult cystic fibrosis patients in Cork and Kerry alone by the end of next year.  I understand the statement of need provides for an adult day centre for adult cystic fibrosis patients and 11 isolated units for patients.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the multidisciplinary medical team is already in place for the treatment of adult cystic fibrosis patients at Cork University Hospital.  Dr. Barry Plant, a respiratory consultant with particular focus on cystic fibrosis, is driving the initiative within the hospital for the provision of dedicated facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.  The team also comprises a paediatric respiratory consultant, adult and paediatric nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  In addition, the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland is funding a registrar post at Cork University Hospital this year and, hopefully, next year as well.  Essentially, the multidisciplinary team is already in place and the patients are being treated, but not in a suitable and appropriate environment.</P>
        <P>The Build4Life campaign is calling on the HSE to identify an area within the hospital campus which would be suitable for the provision of these dedicated cystic fibrosis facilities.  This is absolutely essential because cystic fibrosis patients are at serious risk of cross-infection on an ongoing basis, which results in many visits to hospital.  At present, cystic fibrosis patients must be admitted to hospital through the accident and emergency department, which leaves the patients exposed to infections which can be life threatening, given their condition.  One in 19 people in Ireland carries the cystic fibrosis gene.  If two persons with the gene have a child, that child has a one-in-four chance of having cystic fibrosis.  There are many families who have more than one child with cystic fibrosis.  I believe that the HSE has an obligation to respond to the extraordinary voluntary initiative taken by everyone associated in the Build4Life campaign in Cork and Kerry, and I ask the HSE as a matter of priority to identify an area within Cork University Hospital where these facilities can be provided.</P>
        <P>The Pollock report of 2005 demonstrated clearly that the majority of adults with cystic fibrosis in Ireland are being treated in facilities that are dangerous.  The report was extremely critical of the lack of segregation and isolation facilities throughout the country.  The report <Col N="856"/>recommended the development of a small number of dedicated cystic fibrosis centres around the country.</P>
        <P>Life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients in other European countries and in the United States is in the 40s and 50s, with many patients living with cystic fibrosis and leading healthy and productive lives well into their 60s.  As the country with the highest incidence of cystic fibrosis in the world, we should become the world leaders in services and facilities for cystic fibrosis patients, and I hope that the Minister will have a positive response on the development of such facilities at Cork University Hospital.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>There are currently approximately 1,100 people living with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  Approximately 45% of these people are adults and 55% are children.  The Minister has identified the development of cystic fibrosis services as a policy priority in recent years.  In 2006 and 2007, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.78 million was provided to the Health Service Executive to develop cystic services.  Part of this funding has facilitated the appointment of 44 staff to date to deal directly with cystic fibrosis in a number of hospitals nationally, including Cork University Hospital.  In addition, the necessary funding has been made available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.  The other hospitals which have benefited from this funding include five in Dublin &mdash; St. Vincent&rsquo;s, Crumlin, Tallaght, Beaumont and Temple Street &mdash; together with Galway, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
        <P>Cork University Hospital currently provides both adult and paediatric cystic fibrosis services.  It is one of very few hospitals that have both services on the same site.  There has been a significant investment in the resource allocated to enhancing cystic fibrosis services at Cork University Hospital over the past number of years.  In excess of &euro;700,000 in additional revenue funding was provided to the hospital in 2006 and was used to recruit two new medical consultants, one to lead an adult service and the other to lead a paediatric service.  The consultant for adult service took up his post in August 2007.  Interviews for the second post were held but did not result in the selection of a suitable candidate for permanent appointment.  The post is currently filled in a temporary capacity pending its filling on a permanent basis.</P>
        <P>Additional nursing, allied health professional and clerical support staff have also been recruited for cystic services in Cork University Hospital.  In 2007 the HSE southern hospitals group received an additional revenue allocation of &euro;293,000.  This funding will be used to recruit a medical scientist to support the provision of microbiology services and to advise on infection status and antibiotic susceptibility of people with cystic fibrosis.  The funding will also help to enhance nursing and physiotherapy support services with the planned recruitment of two further nurse specialists and a physiotherapist for cystic fibrosis patients.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed the Minister for Health and Children that it is currently considering the provision in Cork University Hospital of a new dedicated facility for patients with cystic fibrosis.  This would include inpatient beds, a dedicated day unit and a respiratory ward to accommodate the caseload of adult patients, and the necessary multidisciplinary team, and enable cystic fibrosis services to be delivered in line with best practice.  A new facility would also provide a pathway for existing paediatric patients to move to adult care within the same setting and with many shared staff.</P>
        <P>The Minister understands that Cork University Hospital has been in discussion with the Build4Life programme, a charitable organisation which is proposing to donate up to &euro;1 million towards a dedicated cystic fibrosis unit at the hospital.  The pace at which such developments <Col N="857"/>can take place will, of course, depend on the availability of the capital and revenue funding, but the Minister and the HSE are committed to ensuring the best possible service for patents in the Cork area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting for the Adjournment this serious situation created by the withdrawal of the visiting teacher for visually-impaired students in County Mayo.  This service was already restricted but nonetheless invaluable to the 45 visually-impaired students attending schools in County Mayo.  Each school where there was a student or students with visual impairment was visited, probably just once a term, so that they could get the help and advice needed.</P>
        <P>The visiting teacher was withdrawn in September and replaced by a telephone consultation advice service on each Monday for two hours.  We have all been hearing about the cutbacks in education after yesterday&rsquo;s budget, but the withdrawal of the visiting teacher in County Mayo came two months ago and is especially miserable because it takes away what was only a partial service in the first place.  This is a cutback on top of a cutback.  We have been assured that the savings introduced by the Minister will not affect the disadvantaged and the vulnerable.  There is evidence to the contrary in this instance.  The amount of money needed to restore the partial service that existed before September would be only minute in the great scheme of things.</P>
        <P>This service is critical to the education of children with visual impairment.  It is of vital importance not only to the affected student but also to the teacher and the student&rsquo;s classmates.  Everyone is made aware of the difficulties a visually impaired child can face.  Advice is also given on the teaching tools and computer technology that can be of great assistance.  I was visited by the parents of visually impaired children following the withdrawal of this service.  It is hard to explain to them that we could sit in the House all night a week or two ago to provide billions to bail out banks, yet we cannot provide a few buttons, as it were, to maintain a service such as this.</P>
        <P>After speaking with a number of school principals and the parents affected by this, I cannot over-emphasise the necessity of restoring the visiting teacher.  It was an invaluable service for teachers and visually impaired students.  To suggest that the same service can be provided by mobile telephone is grossly insulting to the plight of these children.  The telephone solution is really quite bizarre when one considers that it is dealing with visually impaired students.  Equally alarming is that the Department of Education and Science, through its directorate of regional services, has indicated that while new referrals can continue to be sent to the regional office, there is no guarantee of service for them until further notice.</P>
        <P>Does this mean that new students in County Mayo with visual impairment will get no assistance until further notice?  I do not know what the Minister will reply but I am anxious that my question is answered before I leave the House.  I make a final appeal to the Minister to restore this service.  The children with visual impairment relied on it.  Even though it was limited and inexpensive, it gave them a sense of security and self-esteem.  In short, they felt cared for.  Will the Minister walk away from them now, in their hour of need?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement on this matter.  The Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s visiting teacher service promotes, facilitates and supports the education of children with visual impairment from pre-school through first and second level schooling to third level.  In addition to working with individual children, the work of a visiting teacher includes involvement with parents, schools, teachers and access offices in third level institutions.  A key element of the visiting teacher&rsquo;s work is engagement with a range of referral agencies, such as the National Council for the Blind in Ireland, special education needs <Col N="858"/>organisers and other agencies working in support of visually impaired children and their families.</P>
        <P>Taking account of an individual child&rsquo;s level of impairment and need for support, the involvement of a visiting teacher with that child may vary between once weekly contact in the case of blind children; monthly, once a term or annual contact in other cases and occasional visits to special schools primarily to support staff where children have other underlying disabilities.  With regard to County Mayo, referral agencies, schools and parents of pre-school children with visual impairment currently are being informed by visiting teacher management of an interim telephone advisory service that is now being provided while alternative arrangements for a visiting teacher presence in County Mayo are examined.  New referrals to the service continue to be accepted and assessed.</P>
        <P>Most recent caseload figures for County Mayo show a total of 51 children who are eligible for support from the visiting teacher service on current criteria.  These break down as follows: six of pre-school age, 23 in primary schools, eight at second level and 14 in special schools.  I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to provide a service in County Mayo at the earliest opportunity.  Again, I thank him for affording me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding this matter.</P>

      <sTitle>Schools Building Projects.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this important issue.  It concerns a school in Ballygarvan, outside Cork city, that was promised a new school building ten years ago this month by the then Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  There have been five other Ministers since then but the school is still waiting.  It has not even reached the stage of a site being purchased.  This is extremely frustrating for the children, their parents, the school principal and the teachers.</P>
        <P>At present, there are 265 pupils in the school.  There are two permanent classrooms and eight prefabs.  The site is just over half an acre and is full to capacity.  There is no room to put any more prefabs on it.  A site for a new school has been identified.  It is in three parcels and the Department of Education and Science is fully aware of the details about purchasing it.  Recently, it asked the diocese to purchase the site, which the diocese is willing to do if it gets an assurance from the Minister and the Department that a school will be built on it.  The diocese does not wish to be left with a site and no school on it.  The Department should be the driving force on this matter but it has failed to act.</P>
        <P>The situation at the school has now become more urgent.  At a recent meeting, the school principal informed the parents of 19 children that the school would be unable to accept their children next year.  The school is at a stage where it can only accommodate siblings of the pupils in the school.  Children who are living next door to the school, therefore, cannot be accommodated.  There is no space on the site for additional classrooms.  If the Department would ensure that the other site was purchased, perhaps that problem could be resolved.</P>
        <P>The situation at the school has reached a crisis.  It is in a rapidly developing area and in the past few weeks Cork County Council gave permission for the construction of 144 additional housing units in the village of Ballygarvan.  One can readily estimate how many children will have to be accommodated in a school that is still on a waiting list for site purchase.  This is an urgent problem, particularly for the 19 children who have been told there is no place for them in the school next year.  They will not be going to school with their neighbours or friends in the locality.  Instead, it appears they will have to seek school placements outside the village.</P><Col N="859"/>
        <P>This matter is in the Minister&rsquo;s hands.  He can act to ensure that the site is purchased and that the project moves to design stage immediately.  It is in his interest and, more importantly, in the interests of the children in the school and their stressed teachers and principal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  It provides me with the opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and the position on the provision of additional school accommodation for Ballygarvan national school.</P>
        <P>The Government has dramatically increased investment in the schools building programme.  Under the lifetime of the national development plan, almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.  The Minister recently announced a list of schools to go to construction as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing additional school accommodation.  The schools building projects announced by the Minister will provide permanent primary school places for more than 4,600 students in five new schools and 15 extended and modernised schools.</P>
        <P>A further 3,000 students at post-primary level will benefit from one new school and three major extension and refurbishment projects.  The provision of a new physical education hall in a post-primary school will benefit another 600 students.  Seven of these schools building projects are in a position to start construction towards the end of the year.  A further 15 are expected to be in a position to start construction in the first quarter of next year.</P>
        <P>This year, more than &euro;586 million will be spent on the schools building programme, with one third of that invested in rapidly developing areas.  This has resulted in the delivery of 12,000 new school places in 2008, a record number in any one year.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment that reflects this Government&rsquo;s commitment to continuing the programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  The Minister intends to make a further announcement in the first quarter of 2009 on major primary and post-primary school projects to proceed to construction.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a developing areas unit was set up recently in the Department to focus on the school accommodation needs of rapidly developing areas.  The main emphasis in 2008 and 2009 is on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, in addition to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  Ballygarvan national school is a co-educational school catering for boys and girls from junior infants to sixth class.  Enrolments in the school have risen steadily from 140 pupils in 2000 to an expected enrolment for 2008 of 251 pupils.  The staffing at the school reflects this enrolment.</P>
        <P>The school&rsquo;s board of management submitted an application to the Department of Education and Science for a new school building.  The existing school site is very restricted and, on its own, is not a viable site for the proposed project.  The Deputy will be aware that a suitable site has been identified.  This site comprises three plots of land belonging to three separate owners.  It was originally intended that the Department would acquire the three plots of land.  Negotiations, while difficult at times, were progressing on that basis.  Earlier this year the school&rsquo;s patron indicated that he was willing to acquire the plots of land directly to advance the project and overcome difficulties experienced.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has been in contact with key stakeholders with a view to exploring the options open to advancing both the acquisition of the plots of land and the proposed building project.  These discussions are ongoing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me and Deputy O&rsquo;Connor to raise this very important matter.  Not only does it affect the two sports halls in our constituency, namely those in Killinarden and Firhouse, but also the centres in Palmerstown and Collinstown.</P>
        <P>The concept of dual sports halls first came into being when the Government made &euro;34 million available for nine halls nationally.  The halls were to be used in a dual capacity and were to be much more significant than the average PE hall.  They are three times the size of the latter, they are equipped to a very high standard and, most important, they are accessible to the wider local population as well as the school population.  The objective was that the four halls in question would be open 24 hours per day, seven days per week, such that the community would have use of them after school hours.  The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, stated the project was to encourage positive links between the local community and schools and to open up the state of the art facilities to young people from disadvantaged communities.  This holds true for Killinarden and Firhouse.</P>
        <P>I understand from County Dublin Vocational Education Committee that 8,000 people use the halls constantly.  Not only are they used by the local community schools, they are also used by the local national schools.  This is an extraordinary asset to primary education.  It is very important that we save the jobs in Firhouse and Killinarden in addition to the facilities.  The funding provided under the dormant accounts fund or the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund has now dried up.  I am aware that a clear verbal commitment was made by the Department of Education and Science to County Dublin Vocational Education Committee that necessary replacement funding would be found once the initial phase of funding ended.  It has now come to an end.</P>
        <P>In a few months, the facilities in Firhouse and Killinarden, designed for multi-purpose use, including community use, twenty four hours per day, will no longer be available unless replacement funding is found to keep them open and to keep the capital investment, which has been so wisely used, to the forefront of our entire endeavour as a local community.  We await what I hope will be the positive remarks of the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science.  Otherwise, the facilities will be closed after 4 p.m. each day, which none of us can accept.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to join Deputy Brian Hayes in raising this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  The importance I ascribe to it can be gauged from the fact that I have rushed back from Croke Park where I was cheering on my Tallaght neighbours, Robbie Keane and Richard Dunne &mdash; I am not quite in their age group so I cannot call them colleagues.  I was there for Robbie Keane&rsquo;s goal but then returned to the House and missed him getting injured.  The Minister of State knows I would not leave Croke Park if my being here to raise this issue tonight were not important.  </P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, has emphasised we are referring to the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee facilities in Palmerstown, Collinstown, Firhouse and Killinarden.  I will not talk too much about the former two because I have no plans for them in respect of the European elections but I will concentrate on Firhouse and Killinarden.  I was at the official opening of the centre in Firhouse with the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.</P><Col N="861"/>
        <P>We must impress upon the Minister of State the importance of this issue, regardless of his reply tonight.  It is a question of sport.  It is interesting that I referred to being in Croke Park and sports persons from Tallaght given that we are discussing two excellent facilities that are under threat.  Not only do these facilities provide an excellent service to the primary schools and communities generally, they are used in the school completion programme.  This is the case in respect of Killinarden community school, which is in a disadvantaged RAPID area.</P>
        <P>It makes no sense to get into a bind over who should fund first-class State facilities.  As a former member of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee and former member of South Dublin County Council, as was Deputy Brian Hayes, I campaigned for the PE halls in both Killinarden and Firhouse.  The battles were well fought and the communities got right behind the campaigns.  They now support the facilities in a very definite and positive way.  I receive many calls on this issue from young people, employees whose jobs are in jeopardy and others who, for all sorts of reasons, want to use the facilities.  I make a special appeal to the Minister of State to acknowledge this issue, which is so important to me and my community in Tallaght.  We really hope he will help us.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputies Brian Hayes and Charlie O&rsquo;Connor for raising this matter, in particular Deputy O&rsquo;Connor for his dedication and commitment to his constituents in returning to the House.  I am grateful to the Deputies for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the background to the provision of these facilities.  To begin with, these halls were built as part of a programme to develop community sports halls in drugs task force areas in Dublin and Cork.  The stated objective of the programme was that each hall would be dual use in nature in that they would be accessible to the wider community as well as to the local school population.  The intention was that, apart from normal school usage, the facilities would be available as much as possible to the community and, in particular, to target groups such as youth at risk.</P>
        <P>As a reflection of its commitment to the programme, my Department provided funding in excess of &euro;34 million to cover in full the capital cost of constructing nine dual use halls with enhanced facilities attached to post-primary schools.  Eight of these halls are located in Dublin, including the halls referred to by the Deputies, and one is in Cork.  The full list of relevant schools is as follows: Firhouse Community College, Tallaght; Killinarden Community School, Tallaght; Collinstown Park Community College, Clondalkin; Scoil Phobail losolde, Palmerstown; Pearse College, Crumlin; College of Further Education, Inchicore; Senior College, Ballyfermot; St. Michael&rsquo;s secondary school, Finglas; and St. Vincent&rsquo;s Convent secondary school, Cork city.  These halls are of a different order of magnitude to the standard school PE hall.  They are over three times the size of a standard hall and include a large number of distinct spaces, including the main arena, a meeting room, a fitness studio and a multi-purpose area.</P>
        <P>An application was made by my Department in 2006 for dormant accounts funding to enable community usage of the halls to commence.  Government approval was received in 2007 for the drawdown of funding of approximately &euro;2.1 million in respect of six of the halls, including those referred to by the Deputies.  In regard to these six halls, management structures were put in place and community groups were given access.  In Dublin county, County Dublin VEC has managed and operated the halls at the schools in Firhouse, Killinarden, Clondalkin and Palmerstown, while in Dublin city, Dublin City Council, on behalf of my Department and City of Dublin VEC, has managed and operated the halls at Inchicore and Crumlin.</P>
        <P>The position is that the allocated dormant accounts funding will provide for the operation of these halls until the end of 2008.  My Department does not normally fund community facili<Col N="862"/>ties but we are in contact with other Departments with responsibilities in this area and will be in contact with the relevant stakeholders.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputies once again for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position on this matter.</P>

        <Quest> the cost to the Exchequer, if the maximum allowable pension fund was capped at &euro;5 million, &euro;4 million, &euro;3 million and &euro;2 million respectively. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Budget and Finance Act 2006 introduced a maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes.  A limit of &euro;5 million was placed on the total capital value of pension benefits that an individual can draw upon in their lifetime from tax-relieved pension arrangements.  This is known as the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT). </P>
        <P>A higher limit (the Personal Fund Threshold &mdash; PFT) was also introduced at that time for individuals whose pension fund values exceeded &euro;5 million on the date the SFT was introduced, 7 December 2005.  The PFT was deemed necessary on the grounds that those individuals with pension funds in excess of &euro;5 million had built up those funds in good faith over the years while availing of tax reliefs available by reference to the law as it stood prior to the change and it would not have been possible to retrospectively deny them those reliefs.</P>
        <P>Finance Act 2006 also introduced indexation for both the SFT and PFT from 2007 onwards in line with an earnings factor.  As a result, for example, the value of the SFT for 2008 has increased to over &euro;5.4 million.  Indexation will not occur in 2009 however.</P>
        <P>As with the Budget 2006 change, therefore, any reduced SFT limit, as proposed by the Deputy would have to take account of the pension funds of individuals that had been built up legitimately above any new limit.  Consequently, any reduction in the SFT would be unlikely to have immediate effects in terms of Exchequer savings.</P>
        <P>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant data is not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling the estimates requested by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Intensified oversight and scrutiny of financial institutions has been in place since the onset of the current turmoil in financial markets.  I note that the Chief Executive of the Financial Regulator, appearing yesterday before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, stated the Regulator intends to increase further its focus on the management of credit and liquidity risks of the banks, through measures such as the deployment of additional senior supervisory staff and introducing enhanced reporting obligations in relation to capital, asset quality and individual large loans to supplement its daily liquidity reporting requirements.  Later today, under powers conferred on me by the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act, 2008, I will present to the Houses of the Oireachtas the scheme setting out the detailed terms and conditions on which support will be provided to financial institutions, including additional provisions to ensure that high standards of regulation are achieved in Ireland and that the quality of corporate governance in the institutions that benefit from the guarantee acts as a bulwark against any risk of loss for the State. </P>
        <P>In relation to the increased access to funds that credit institutions have enjoyed in recent weeks, it is to be welcomed that the guarantee of deposits and lending to credit institutions active in this economy has, as intended, enabled credit institutions to access adequate liquidity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, mortgage insurance is only one of a number of factors that has the potential to increase home ownership for people requiring higher loan to value mortgages.</P>
        <P>Mortgage insurance for lenders is a financial product that already exists in Ireland and providers of the product must be authorised in accordance with the European Communities (Non Life Insurance) Regulations, 1994 (Statutory Instrument No. 359 of 1994).</P>
        <P>The provider should conduct an appropriate assessment of the risk attached to each mortgage in line with commercial considerations and regulatory requirements should it wish to take out mortgage insurance cover.</P>
        <P>These regulatory requirements include the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  The Code requires a mortgage provider to gather and record sufficient information from the consumer to enable it to provide a recommendation appropriate to that consumer.  The level of information gathered should be appropriate to the nature, and complexity, of the product sought and allow the provider to provide a professional service.  The provider must ensure that, <Col N="866"/>having regard to the facts disclosed by the consumer and other relevant facts about the consumer of which it is aware, the product is suitable to that consumer.</P>

	<P>The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) is responsible for the implementation of CervicalCheck, the National Cervical Screening Programme.  Colposcopy services are an integral part of a population based screening programme.  Women who have pre-cancerous cell changes detected by their smear test are referred for colposcopy.</P>
        <P>The NCSS is making a significant investment to enhance colposcopy services.  This will ensure timely access to a quality assured colposcopy service for women who require further investigation.  It is important to ensure that as part of CervicalCheck, women can access colposcopy services within international best practice timeframes, based on adherence to quality assured clinical practice and the achievement of best clinical outcomes for women.</P>
        <P>The NCSS has identified eleven colposcopy services to support CervicalCheck initially.  The colposcopy service at Letterkenny General Hospital (LGH) has not been identified for initial referrals of women.  However, in the interim LGH will continue to provide colposcopy services to women already attending or awaiting colposcopy.</P>
        <P>The provision of additional colposcopy services to women in the North West is being examined.  The colposcopy service at LGH requires a number of enhancements to meet the quality assurance standards defined by the NCSS.  The NCSS is working with LGH and the question of the hospital&rsquo;s future participation in the colposcopy service for CervicalCheck will be considered in this context.</P>

	<P>In relation to health services for people with a disability, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the significant resources which have been expended on disability services in 2008.  The Multi-Annual Investment Programme for Disability Services makes provision for the development of additional residential, respite places and day care places for people with intellectual disability and Autism and additional residential care and home support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
        <P>In the 2008 Budget, &euro;50m was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to fund a range of additional services under the Multi-Annual Investment Programme for Disability.  Although the commencement of the planned developments in disability services this year had been delayed to a financial review, I am pleased to inform you that the Executive has informed the Department of Health and Children that it is now in the process of rolling out the planned developments.  The HSE has indicated that due to the delayed start to some of these developments, it expects to spend &euro;33m of the &euro;50m by the end of 2008.  The resulting &euro;17m time related savings were included in this Department&rsquo;s budgetary consolidation measures announced in the House in July 2008.</P>
        <P>In light of the current financial circumstances, it has been necessary to defer the implementation of the 2009 element of the Multi-Annual Investment Programme.  Priority is being given in 2009 to therapy services for children with special needs, with &euro;10m in additional funding being made available to provide 125 additional posts, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and clinical psychologists.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are responsible for the provision of road traffic signs on regional and local roads.  A five-year Regional Road Signposting Programme was introduced in 2003 with the aim of upgrading directional signposts on all significant junctions on all regional roads in county council areas.  A sum of &euro;3.9 million was provided for this programme in 2007 and a total of &euro;7.5 million has been allocated towards it in 2008.</P>
        <P>Local authorities may also use discretionary improvement and block grants towards the cost of providing signposting on regional and local roads.  In 2008, the discretionary improvement grant allocation to County Councils is &euro;24.9 million and the block grant allocation to City, Borough and Town Councils is &euro;16.1 million.</P>
        <P>In accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act, 1993, the allocation of funding in relation to the construction or maintenance of national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority.</P>

It is the responsibility of the licensee to adhere to any conditions imposed by planning authorities and other statutory bodies.</P>
        <P>The IAA has advised me that it has made no amendment to the Weston Aerodrome Licence since 2005, when the Authority harmonised the licence conditions for all public use aerodromes.

	<P>Long Term Residency is an administrative scheme introduced in May 2004 and is focused on persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit / work authorisation / work visa conditions.  Such persons may apply to my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants. Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency. While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in June 2008. Applications are dealt with in strict chronological order. I understand that applications received in January 2007 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on his case, the person concerned will be notified.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I can advise the Deputy that my Department, in association with the Probation Service commissioned a &lsquo;Review of Adult Probation Residential Facilities&rsquo;  in 2007  in order to examine, inter alia, the management structure, overall governance and operation of the four residential facilities and the role of the Probation Service. The commission also sought recommendations for the future of the facilities. In addition, the review included an examination of the efficiency, effectiveness and value for money achieved from the funding provided. The report was completed at the end of July 2008 and provides the Probation Service and my Department with a very valuable &lsquo;blue print&rsquo; of how the four facilities are currently operating.</P>
        <P>I would like to advise the Deputy that the residential facility in question was established to provide short term accommodation to prisoners on release.  It has no role in the provision of &lsquo;critical addiction counselling and recovery services&rsquo; as stated by the Deputy.  The findings of the review in respect of the facility detailed by the Deputy gave cause for concern.  Of particular concern is that,  &ldquo;a clear vision, purpose and strategy for Kazelain is absent and it is difficult to determine its fit with the Probation Service&rsquo;s or any other strategy&ldquo;. The report notes the absence of &lsquo;structured activities&rsquo; and &ldquo;while Kazelain&rsquo;s literature aspires to provide personal development and independent living skills there are no specific programmes in place to achieve this&ldquo;. The overall conclusion of the Report was that the centre in question was &ldquo;a costly project and represents very poor value for money given the service provided.  Taking the average occupancy rate of 7, the staff to resident rations is 1.71, well above the norms for supported housing in the homeless sector.&rdquo; The report went on to say that the Board of Management &ldquo;appears divided, dysfunctional and is not working in harmony with the acting manager&rdquo;. The evaluator got no sense that there was a clear, coherent vision for Kazelain in the context of its role of providing services for the Probation Service that is shared by all the Board members.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of the report the Board of Management (BOM) of the centre received a letter from the Probation Service in September advising them of the findings and inviting them to a meeting with the senior management of the Probation Service. At the meeting held on 2 October, the Director of the Probation Service discussed the report&rsquo;s findings with the Board. They undertook to communicate their decision following their consideration of the findings in the review, in writing, to the Probation Service.</P>
        <P>I am committed to finding the best option available to us to meet the accommodation needs of the client group of the Probation Service. The current report, combined with other reports on the facility, gives us a good basis upon which to make informed decisions that will ultimately lead to a better, more focussed and tailored service to this particular client group.</P>

	<P>The Millennium Development Goal for hunger is to reduce by 50% the proportion of those suffering from hunger by the year 2015. </P>
        <P>Progress to date on achieving this goal has been mixed. Success has been most marked in East Asia &mdash; notably in China and Vietnam. While some progress has been evident in other regions, such progress has been insufficient. In Southern Asia almost 50% of children are underweight and this region alone accounts for more than half of the world&rsquo;s undernourished children.</P>
        <P>The majority of those States making the least progress in reducing child malnutrition are located in sub-Saharan Africa, where a number of countries are unlikely to achieve the millennium hunger goal. In sub-Saharan Africa a small improvement has been recorded overall, with the percentage of underweight children less than 5 years of age having fallen from 33% to 29%.</P>
        <P>These statistics do not take account of the full impact of recent global food price increases which are likely, at least in the short term, to further imperil the attainment of the millennium hunger target throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.</P>
        <P>The recent report of our Hunger Task Force outlined the stark realities of the current hunger crisis. It is a chilling fact that the figure for the world&rsquo;s hungry quoted on the cover of that report &mdash; 862 million &mdash; was the estimate at the time of the Rome Food Summit last June. By the time of the launch of the report in September, the estimate had already risen to over 900 million and rising &mdash; driven by the recent upsurge in world food prices.</P>
        <P>The report of the Task Force rightly reflects a sense of urgency at this continuing scandal. I share that sense of urgency. Their report is timely and I welcome its focus on three key areas where they believe Ireland could help to achieve progress. It is my intention to take forward our work in these areas and, in order to facilitate this, I am establishing a new section within my Department which, inter alia, will have a special dedicated focus on food security and which will be tasked with advancing our work on addressing the issue of hunger in our world.</P>

	<P>Funding was awarded to the group in question under the 2005 cycle of the Programme of Support for Local Community and Voluntary Groups.  The Programme provides support to groups to undertake refurbishment works, to engage in a broad range of training activities and to equip community facilities in support of the local delivery of services.  This cycle of grants was closed over two years ago.  Despite signing a contact, the group failed to meet its reporting and drawdown obligations.  As a result of this, the Department moved during 2007 to get the group to claim the outstanding grant by the end of 2007 or have it withdrawn in line with the terms and conditions agreed.  The group made a claim in March 2008 some two and half months after the deadline set by the Department.  I understand that in a review carried out since mid-year, my Department has agreed to process a number of outstanding claims, even though a process to withdraw the grant in question had commenced.  All payments due to the group will be made when outstanding queries have been satisfactorily resolved.</P>

All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain disability-type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.  The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  The proposal to extend the free travel scheme to <Col N="879"/>those with certain medical conditions is one of a range of proposals made to extend the free travel scheme.

        <Quest> the number of people who are in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance at full rate; the number of other social welfare recipients receiving the half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance; if she is satisfied that this system means that more elderly and disabled people can remain in their own homes at minimal cost to the Exchequer compared to full-time care; her views on making the scheme more accessible; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>Budget 2007 provided for new arrangements whereby people can receive a maximum payment equivalent to a half rate carers allowance while receiving another social welfare payment, other than jobseekers benefit or allowance. At present there are 41,539 people in receipt of <Col N="881"/>carers allowance. Of these almost 14,256 are in receipt of half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in addition to another social welfare payment. A further 2,260 people are in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
        <P>In June 2006 the number of hours for which a person can engage in employment, self-employment, education or training and still be considered to be providing full-time care for the purposes of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full-time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income. Approximately, 5,800 people who are not in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit have so far received a respite care grant in respect of 2008. A carer who is caring for two or more people is entitled to a full grant for each of the care recipients. The rate of the grant increased to &euro;1,700 per year from June 2008.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that all of the improvements made to carers payments in recent years have helped more people with disabilities and older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The living alone increase is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone. It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and receiving payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes. The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs faced by a person living alone.</P>
        <P>The policy in relation to support for older people has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension in addition to enhancing the household benefits package which includes TV licence, telephone, electricity/gas and the fuel allowance rather than supplements like the living alone increase. The objective is to use resources to improve the position of all pensioners to the fullest extent possible rather than focusing on particular groups.</P>

	<P>The EU-led operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, was established for a period of one year from March 2008. A total of 409 Defence Forces personnel are currently serving with EUFOR &mdash; 18 at the Operational HQ in Paris and 391 in Chad (23 at the Force Headquarters, and 368 as part of the 98th Infantry Battalion).   The security situation in Chad will require a multidimensional presence well beyond 15th March 2009 when EUFOR&rsquo;s mandate expires. On 24 September 2008, the UN Security Council, (UN Security Council Resolution 1834 (2008)) expressed its intention to authorise a United Nations military component to follow on from the EUFOR when its mandate expires on 15 March 2009. The Security Council requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on the follow on operation by 15 November 2008 concerning its size, structure and mandate. The Security Council should take a decision on the matter by 15 December 2008. To ensure a smooth transition between EUFOR and United Nations follow-on force, the UN has sent a formal request to Ireland to consider putting the Irish troops currently deployed in CHAD with EUFOR under the command of the United Nations after the 15 March 2009. This request is currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Defence Forces. However, any decision to participate will need to await the outcome of ongoing discussions on the size, composition and mandate of the follow-on operation. Account will also be taken of the intentions of other current EU contributors and the support they would provide. Irish participation in a UN follow-on operation will, of course, be subject to the &ldquo;Triple Lock&rdquo; of UN mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval. I would be positively disposed to participation by the Defence Forces in the follow-on mission subject to the above issues being addressed.</P>

        <Quest> the expenditure to date arising from our participation in EU battlegroup operations in Chad and elsewhere; and if any of this money can be recouped from the EU or other bodies. </Quest>

	<P>Battlegroups have been on standby in the European Union since 1 January 2007.  To date no Battlegroup has been deployed to Chad or elsewhere. However, the Defence Forces are currently deployed with the UN mandated EU-led military operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD/RCA.  All costs associated with deployment of personnel and equipment to this mission are borne by the troop contributing countries. All EU Member States, irrespective of participation, are contributing to the common costs of the operation. The estimated cost to the Defence Vote arising from the Defence Forces participation in this mission will amount to approximately &euro;57m.</P>
        <P>Ireland participated in the Nordic Battlegroup (NBG), which was on standby from 1st January 2008 to 30th June 2008.  The other members of the Nordic Battlegroup were Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway and Estonia. The Defence Forces contribution to the NBG was an Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (EOD/IEDD) contingent with its own security detail. Although the Nordic Battlegroup did not deploy, Ireland incurred expenditure of &euro;6.77m, which covered the costs associated with training and the purchase of new equipment to fulfil our particular obligations to the NBG.</P>
        <P>The expenditure on equipment covered the purchase of vehicles and spare part, ammunition, engineering equipment, etc. This equipment has subsequently been re-allocated within the Defence Forces, addressing equipment requirements as they arose.</P>
        <P>Training costs related to deployment of Defence Forces personnel and equipment to Sweden for specific training exercises. These training exercises were primarily focused on testing the interoperability and strategic movement of the Defence Forces within the NBG and were designed to enhance the skills required for a real life Battlegroup deployment. None of the costs incurred by Ireland resulting from our participation in the Nordic Battlegroup or in the EUFOR operation in Chad are recoupable from the EU or elsewhere.</P>

	<P>The question of extending the areas subject to smokeless fuels regulations has been, and continues to be, kept under review in consultation with local authorities <Col N="884"/>and having regard to the need to ensure good air quality.  Monitoring at permanent and mobile monitoring stations by the EPA and local authorities confirms that air quality in Ireland is good.  The question of the need to extend the air quality monitoring network to cover additional urban areas due to population changes has been raised with the EPA in the context of an overall monitoring review which has been requested by my Department as part of the Programme for Government commitment on monitoring air quality. I expect the EPA will conclude this review by year end.</P>
        <P>On 8 October 2008 I signed a new voluntary agreement with the Solid Fuel Trade Group. This provides that in the towns and environs of Athlone, Carlow, Clonmel and Ennis, the Group will maintain the smokeless fuel market penetration level of 75%, as a percentage of overall solid fuel sales, as set out in previous agreements.  These four towns are additional to those already covered by smokeless zones.</P>
        <P>In the context of developing the <i>&ldquo;</i>National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012<i>&rdquo;</i>, my Department engaged consultants to advise on greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions from the use of solid fuel in all sectors of the economy. The consultants report &ldquo;Determining the Share of National Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Emissions Trading in Ireland 2008-2012&rdquo; is available on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.environ.ie). In addition, in its recent report on &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Environment 2008&rdquo;, the EPA addresses, and provides a breakdown of, the total energy requirement by fuel type in the period 1990-2006.  A copy of the report and its greenhouse gas emission projections for the Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008-2012 are available on the Agency&rsquo;s website (www.epa.ie).</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the hardship being caused to elderly and disabled people in County Monaghan as a result of the failure of his Department to adequately fund Monaghan County Council for the housing adaption grants scheme, the mobility aid scheme and the housing aid for older people scheme since the introduction of these new schemes from 1 November 2007; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the council has a shortfall of more than &euro;2.8 million versus the value of applications on hand at 20 September 2008 and that old and vulnerable people in the county are being forced to borrow from financial institutions as the council cannot pay out the grants approved; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>My Department is very much aware of the critical role that the Housing Adaptation Grant schemes for Older People and People with a Disability play in the context of an overall continuum of care. The revised suite of grant schemes, implemented in November 2007, streamline the administrative and operational procedures governing the schemes, providing a more targeted and integrated response to the housing needs of some of the more vulnerable members of society. </P>
        <P>The launch of the revised suite of grant schemes and the associated publicity has led to a heightened level of demand across a number of local authority areas. In light of this, housing authorities have been requested to prioritise applications within available resources, with particular consideration to be given to those applicants requiring alterations or adaptations to facilitate discharge from hospital or alleviate the need for hospitalisation in the future, and those applicants who require essential repairs or improvement works as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>A combined allocation of &euro;1,911,390 was notified to Monaghan County Council earlier this year for the operation of these schemes. It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the level of funding to be provided for each of the schemes from within this combined allocation and to manage the operation of the schemes from within this allocation.</P>
        <P>In light of particularly significant levels of demand under these schemes, Monaghan County Council was recently notified of an additional Exchequer allocation of &euro;250,000 towards their operation in 2008.</P>

	<P>As previously indicated to local authorities, requests for additional funding under the Housing Adaptation Grants Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability are dealt with in the context of the reallocation of any surplus resources arising elsewhere. In this context, my Department has advised all local authorities to monitor their expenditure under the Schemes carefully. </P>
        <P>Requests have been received from a number of local authorities, including Kildare County Council, for supplementary allocations in respect of the Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes and the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Schemes. In response to the particularly high levels of activity under the revised schemes experienced in 2008 by certain local authorities, my Department recently made supplementary Exchequer allocations totalling &euro;3.6 million towards the operation of these schemes this year.</P>
        <P>While Kildare County Council was not among those authorities, the issue of an additional allocation to the Council will be considered in the event of further funding becoming available. My Department has re-emphasised to local authorities the importance of prioritisation in assessing grant applications given the level of activity being experienced nationally.</P>

	<P>The Planning Code provides for extensive public notification of proposed development.  It is a general requirement that a valid application for planning permission must be advertised by site notice and a notice in an approved local or national newspaper.  These notices must state, inter alia, that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority, and that submissions or observations in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing on payment of the prescribed fee within the five week period beginning on the date of the receipt by the planning authority of the application. </P>
        <P>Article 19(4) of the 2001 Regulations provides that where a valid planning application is made in respect of any land or structure, and a subsequent application is made within six months from the date of making the first-mentioned application in respect of land substantially consisting of the site or part of the site to which the first-mentioned application related, the site notice for the subsequent application must be on a yellow background rather a white background.  Accordingly an existing site notice could not be replaced by a notice of the same colour unless there was over six months between the two planning applications.</P>
        <P>Article 20 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 was amended in 2006 to require a site notice to be removed by the applicant following the notification of the planning authority decision on a planning application.</P>
        <P>Article 26 (5) of the 2001 Regulations also provides that the notification from a planning authority to an applicant that his/her planning application is invalid, must request the applicant to remove the site notice.  I have no plans at this time to further amend the legislation in relation to site notices.</P>

        <P>In March 2007, my Department published new design guidelines on housing delivery entitled Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities.  As well as housing design issues, the guidelines address integrated approaches to the delivery of community facilities.  Guidelines were also <Col N="888"/>published in September 2007 on Design Standards for New Apartments which promote quality design and space standards.</P>
        <P>Draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas issued for public consultation in February 2008, accompanied by an Urban Design Manual which sets out best practice in implementing the guidelines.  These guidelines will promote high quality living standards in new residential developments, encourage higher density developments at appropriate locations such as those with access to public transport, emphasise that new residential development must be integrated with facilities and services for the new community and promote energy efficiency.  Following consideration of the seventy detailed submissions received, I intend to issue finalised statutory guidelines by the end of this year which will replace the 1999 Residential Density Guidelines.</P>

	<P>The Irish Hare is listed in Annex V of the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC).</P><Col N="889"/>
        <P>Under Article 17 of the Directive member states are obliged to report to the European Commission on the status of listed habitats and species every six years.  In December 2007, Ireland submitted the first baseline assessments of conservation status for all 59 habitats and some 100 species that occur in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Each species was assessed according to its range across Ireland, the population, the quality of its habitat and its future prospects.  The reporting template requires the results of the assessment to be expressed as good, inadequate or bad status.</P>
        <P>The range and future prospects of the Hare were considered favourable.  As the extent of population fluctuation between years is not yet understood, it was not possible to identify a specific favourable reference value for population, resulting in an &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; response to this assessment category.</P>
        <P>The habitat was assessed as inadequate because there had been some loss due to urbanisation and agricultural intensification.  Although only one assessment category reported an inadequate result the rules of the reporting methodology require that the overall summary position must then be described as inadequate.</P>
        <P>I understand that the ruling of the European Court of Justice in 2007 concerned species in Annex IV of the Habitats Directive and therefore does not relate to the Irish Hare.</P>

	<P>The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR) has overall responsibility for energy policy and is the lead Department for the promotion and development of renewable energy, including biofuels. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food supports the supply side of the bio-fuel market by offering grants to farmers to grow energy crops as feedstock for domestic bio-fuel production. The introduction of these incentives contributed to the planting of some 9,000 hectares of energy crops in 2007.</P>
        <P>The incentives introduced by my Department include a National Energy Crop Premium to supplement the EU premium available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme. A new Bioenergy Scheme was also launched providing establishment grants of &euro;1,450 per hectare to farmers interested in planting willow and miscanthus. Areas planted with energy crops can also qualify for the Single Payment. The Department is also funding research projects that relate directly to biofuels and energy crops through the Department&rsquo;s Research Stimulus Fund Programme. The aim of this research is to identify and select plant varieties and crop production systems that are most suited to bio-fuel production in the Irish context.</P>
        <P>The Department has published Best Practice guidelines for growing willow and miscanthus under the Bioenergy Scheme. Among other items, the guide provides advice to growers on planting and harvesting operations to maximise crop yield and improve the economic viability of the crop. Together with Teagasc and Sustainable Energy Ireland, the Department co-funded a new educational DVD entitled &lsquo;Willow &amp; Miscanthus &mdash; From Field To Furnace&rsquo; to advise producers on the planting, crop management, harvesting and storage of these crops. Teagasc has also published a Farm Diversification Manual, which provides detailed technical advice to farmers on the cultivation of energy crops.</P>
        <P>It is a requirement of the Bioenergy Scheme and the EU Energy Crops Scheme that applicants provide evidence of end use to ensure that the feedstock is destined for the bioenergy market. Such evidence may include a contract or letter of intent between the farmer and the end-user and refers to the delivery of oilseed rape for processing into liquid bio-fuel and willow/miscanthus for combustion in the heat and electricity market.  My Department does not compile information on the amount rapeseed refined into bio-fuel.</P>

	<P>The Mullingar element of the decentralisation of my Department&rsquo;s Headquarters will take place when new permanent accommodation is ready for occupation. </P>
        <P>Over 130 posts in Dublin are now held by officers who will relocate to Mullingar with their posts. Volunteers for decentralisation will be assigned to the remaining posts as the current post-holders transfer out under the Dublin Arrangements or to decentralise to other locations.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has procured a site in Mullingar for the development of the new headquarters of my Department. In December 2007, the OPW announced a preferred tenderer for a bundle of three Public Private Partnerships projects to include my Department&rsquo;s <Col N="893"/>new headquarters in Mullingar. Full planning permission for this development was received in July 2008. The contract has yet to be signed and discussions are underway in this regard.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, following a review of the Decentralisation Programme, the Government has given approval for this project to proceed.</P>

	<P>The criteria for appointment of Special Needs Assistants specifies that the minimum requirement necessary for appointment is an award of Grade D (or pass) in Irish, English and Mathematics in the Intermediate Certificate/Junior Certificate or Day Vocational Certificate Examination or in an examination of equivalent standard.  Boards of Management of schools are the employers of all staff, including SNAs, employed in schools. State funding of any SNA position is granted on the basis of agreed recruitment policies and guidelines being adhered to by Boards of Management and <Col N="895"/>these being applied in a fair and consistent manner in all cases. The minimum educational standard required for these positions is based on the needs of the SNA post generally across all schools and it is not open to schools to deviate from this standard in individual cases.</P>
        <P>With regard to the means by which a person may attain the necessary educational requirements, local education service providers (e.g. VEC) may be able to  assist with access to an appropriate course or courses which will, on successful completion, lead to an award of the required standard.</P>
