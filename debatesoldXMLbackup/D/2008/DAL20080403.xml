      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.  I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the urgent need for the Taoiseach to appoint a new senior counsel to investigate the Stardust tragedy in Artane as there is a conflict of interest in the current appointment.  Some of the families of the victims have contacted me. They are very unhappy and angry with the Government that a junior counsel on the Garda legal team in 1981 was selected to head up a new inquiry into the Stardust tragedy.  The families of the victims are now withdrawing all co-operation with the inquiry and seek the urgent appointment of a new independent senior counsel who has no connection with the original inquiry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the mismanagement of our national environmental commitments, which, according to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, will lead to EU fines impacting on every taxpayer in the country who once again will be forced to make up for such incompetence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the failure of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, to advise last night in this Chamber how a 99 year old County Cavan patient and others are to have their increased nursing home charges paid for and further to explain how the &euro;110 million earmarked for delivery of her Fair Deal policy is now being used and why some of this funding cannot be used to pay the nursing home increases, thus removing the pressure and anxiety from our oldest citizens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the survey by the Irish Primary Principals Network published to coincide with world autism day, yesterday, and showing that nine out of ten children with autism are not getting access to the specialist services they need, including speech and language therapists, psychologists and occupational therapists, and the need for Government action to address this totally unacceptable situation.</P>

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Private Members&rsquo; business shall be No. 31, motion re rate of unemployment, which shall also take place tomorrow immediately after the Order of Business and shall be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Sometimes the folders get mixed up.</P>
        <P>The legislative programme for this D&aacute;il session published by the Chief Whip contains 17 Bills, seven of which were listed for the previous session and some others were on the list before that.  Has any analysis been carried out of how these targets are to be reached?  There is little point in publishing lists of Bills which do not make it through to publication, never mind as far as being debated in the House.</P>
        <P>In respect of the figures produced yesterday and with economic indicators going in the wrong direction in many ways, will the T&aacute;naiste consider time for a debate next week, in view of the fact that tax revenue is &euro;600 million short and we are heading for a deficit of more than &euro;6 billion, which will be the largest ever?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="3"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot deal with that matter now, as Deputy Kenny well knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just asking for an opportunity to debate the matter next week.</P>
        <P>The second report on the Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley case, as referred to by Deputies Reilly and Gilmore, sets out very clearly that patient-centred care is not sufficiently embedded in the management process, that systems have delayed and avoided difficult decisions and priority was not given to those who needed it.  This is a major indictment of the capacity of the HSE to do the business for which it has been set up.  Are there any proposals from Government to deal with this situation in view of the fact that the O&rsquo;Malley report follows the Fitzgerald report, both of which equally indict seriously the capacity of the HSE to do its job?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot deal with that matter now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same issue, a Cheann Comhairle, and it is relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is relevant to the Order of Business, but the last issue was not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>From what Deputy Kenny has raised, both in respect of the O&rsquo;Malley report and the Barringtons Hospital report and the indictment of the HSE which they represent, will the Government facilitate an opportunity to have these reports debated and discussed in this House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask whether the Government will facilitate an opportunity to address these reports.  It is a legitimate question to ask and I am appealing that we are given that opportunity.  Let there be no mistake that significant concern arises out of these reports and other investigations under way, including in the north east.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Standing Orders relate to promised business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of what business can be taken and what debates can be held, that is a matter for the Whips to consider.  The House had a debate on the cancer care situation some weeks ago and I contributed to that debate.  The Taoiseach made the point yesterday in response to Deputy Gilmore and it is on the record that an interim policy and procedures have been adopted on the serious incident-management issue.  The Taoiseach gave a full account of the reaction by the HSE and HIQA to these recommendations and the need to ensure, in so far as is possible, there is not a repeat of the incidents such as those in Portlaoise, the case of Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley, Barringtons Hospital and elsewhere.  Policies have been implemented by the Government.  The Health Information and Quality Authority is the mechanism by which we can seek much better quality assessment and quality provision of health care services generally and cancer care in particular in regard to the issues that have been raised this morning.  I refer both Deputies to what the Taoiseach said yesterday in what I thought was a full and informative reply on the present position on those matters.  It is a matter for the Whips to decide if they wish to take that debate further in plenary session in this House.</P>
        <P>On the issue raised by Deputy Kenny on Exchequer returns, it is important to point out that some of the downside risks referred to by me have perhaps started to materialise in terms of the high price of oil, the change in the sterling and dollar exchange rates and the downturn in the international economy, which will have its effect here as it will elsewhere throughout the developed world.   However, we are in a good position in terms of the public finances to withstand the pressures that are undoubtedly emerging as a result of that.  We have a very low <Col N="4"/>GDP-debt ratio &mdash; it is only 15% net.  We will ensure that we control our public expenditure and current expenditure.  We will not resign on our investment plans, namely, the capital investment programme, which is important.  I said in my budget speech that we needed to borrow prudently to invest ambitiously, and we are doing that.  We should not change tack in that respect.  Our approach should be quite the contrary.  Where below potential growth is being achieved, as is happening internationally, that is the time to invest in a capital programme that will ensure we develop the productive side of the economy.  The Government is playing a role in that context in that, as part of the economic cycle, it is making an enhanced contribution in terms of the public expenditure and investment programme.</P>
        <P>Regarding legislation, nine of the 17 Bills on the spring A list of the legislative programme have been published.  There are seven Bills on the new A list, the Irish Sports Council amendment Bill, the broadcasting Bill, the chemicals regulation and enforcement Bill, the ombudsman amendment Bill, the adoption Bill, the health long-term residential care services Bill, the prevention of corruption amendment Bill and the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, which was before the Cabinet only this week and is being dealt with.  Therefore, there is a substantive body of legislation for this session and, hopefully, with the co-operation of everyone we can deal with it in a way that will enable Members on all sides of the House to make a contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise three matters.  The first one relates to the Exchequer figures.  I support Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s call for a debate in the House on those figures and on the changing position of the public finances.  The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reply to Deputy Kenny underscores the need for a debate because the Labour Party would not accept that the changing economic and public finance position is entirely due to international circumstances.  There is the issue of domestic decision-making and the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s management of this area requires to be debated here.  The downturn in the revenues from capital gains tax, stamp duties and so on are intimately related to what has been happening in the property market.  That needs to the debated.  The Ceann Comhairle is shaking his head and I understand why, but this matter needs to be debated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair is indicating to the Deputy that he has made his point and should move on to the next one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The main point is that we understand one another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always advisable to be one step ahead of the Chair.  Are there any plans to introduce Supplementary Estimates arising from the changes that are occurring?</P>
        <P>The second matter I wish to raise concerns the civil unions Bill, on which a report is being prepared by the Government.  I recall that when the Labour Party&rsquo;s Civil Unions Bill was before the House it was promised that the heads of the Government&rsquo;s legislation would be published at the end of February or in March &mdash; I will not quibble about the month.  Is it still intended to publish the heads of the legislation and when will we have sight of them?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The third matter I wish to raise is the electoral amendment Bill, which is listed for publication this session.  This Bill will introduce the revised D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies.  On previous occasions when legislation of this kind was introduced to implement the report of a boundary commission, it was done on a stand-alone basis, in other words, simply in regard to the new constituencies.  I note from the list that what is intended on this occasion is to implement the recommendations of the Constituency Commission, to revise the procedures for the establishment of future commissions and to deal with other electoral matters requiring to be addressed in advance of the 2009 European and local elections.  I have two questions relating <Col N="5"/>to that.  What are these other matters that are required to be addressed before the 2009 elections?  Why is the boundary commission report not being introduced on a stand-alone basis?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will check for the Deputy the other issues referred to in the legislation.  On the question of the possible examination of how electoral commissions will work in the future, comments have been made by Members on all sides of the House on the impact of the constituency revisions that have been published in the report by the commission to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which are meeting with varying degrees of enthusiasm on all sides.  This indicates that because of the huge shift in population etc. there was a greater degree of change on this occasion than was the case in the past.  We are simply presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> and practitioners of politics like ourselves do not have an input into what is happening.  The independence of the commission is in no way being challenged or compromised, but there is some merit in an interim report being published which would invite comments from the House on the workability of the efficacy of some of the proposals, which could be taken into account by the commission when it finalises the report and comes forward with its final position.  At present it is a<i> fait accompli</i> .</P>
        <P>I spoke to Deputies on all sides of the House and they would more than quibble with some of the decisions.  These are recommendations to this House.  The House has the right, if it so wishes and a consensus can be gained, to change any part of those.  The position since 1977 has been that we have always taken the recommendations in blanket form and we have not considered them.  I am aware that since the publication of this report Deputies on all sides of House have had serious reservations about provincial and county boundaries being breached.  Radical changes have been proposed <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the previous arrangements and a great deal of dissatisfaction has been voiced throughout many parts of the country, including in County Leitrim&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste not understand the instructions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for which I have particular sympathy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will he do something about it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is open to this House to do what it wishes about it if we can get a consensus and perhaps a political will should be developed here to stand up for what we would regard as more common-sense solutions than those that are before us.  What we usually do is delegate the responsibility elsewhere, the report comes before the House and we do not have the political courage to sort something out when we know it is not right.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Because it is so politically correct, we do not interfere but stand back.  It could be open to people in this House to come up with solutions if they so wish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste have a proposal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very strongly of the view that if there is a will in this House, an all-party committee could meet to discuss whether a solution can be found.  Obviously one person&rsquo;s solution might be another person&rsquo;s problem.  We could arrange for a minimum 20-seat representation for the Labour Party and that should sort out the problem.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="6"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I have gone to my constituency&rsquo;s political meeting and asked the people of south Offaly for their views on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste knows he must take great care of his constituency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I have gone with the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, who is a great friend of mine, to the vote in north Tipperary and <i>vice versa</i>.  One sees the cam&aacute;in being taken out of the boots of cars.  I have given an undertaking to the people I represent.  That boundary has not been breached since the foundation of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste knows we cannot go into this now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is possible for us as public representatives to galvanise ourselves and create some collective political will to deal with issues we know in our hearts and souls to be anomalous.  We will accept them if we have to but perhaps we should consider doing our job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste to respond to the other points I raised.  I also offer him the counsel that whatever promises he gives in the coming weeks, it would not be advisable to promise changes in constituency boundaries to any of his colleagues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore would be surprised how much support he would find among those seated behind him for such an approach.  Perhaps I am speaking more often than he to those Members, but I know he is working on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste, wherever he goes looking for support, not to look behind me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Deputy Gilmore is held in high regard by those seated behind him.</P>
        <P>On the civil partnership Bill, it was stated in the D&aacute;il that the Minister would bring his proposals to the Government by the end of March.  He has met that deadline.  The proposed scheme draws on the options identified by the working group on domestic partnership, under the chairmanship of Ms Anne Colley, and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report on the rights and duties of cohabitants.  The scheme will propose a statutory civil registration scheme for same sex partners and a redress scheme to provide certain legal protections for them and other cohabitants.  I understand the heads of the Bill are being drafted but I cannot give an exact date for publication.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we see the Bill?</P>

	<P>We will deal with the Bill this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Were the heads of the Bill brought to the Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No, they are being drafted.  The Minister said in the D&aacute;il that he would bring his proposals on how to address this issue to the Government.  That was done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of the redrawing of constituencies, we all had an opportunity, which some of us exercised and others did not, to make a submission to the independent commission, which is chaired by a High Court judge.  We should leave it to the commission to make the decision, whatever that decision may be.  As much as we would like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has commented on this issue and I wish to respond.  It is a matter that must be left out of the political domain.  Let us make our submissions to the commission and let the commission decide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd makes an important point and it is important that we are accurate about the statutory position.  Submissions can be made to the commission, as the Deputy observed.  The commission then brings forward its recommendations to this House and it is open to us to accept all, any or none of them.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is time that this sovereign Parliament took upon itself the responsibilities arising in this area.  If we have a difficulty with the commission&rsquo;s recommendations and can devise a consensus around modifications or changes, why should we not do so on behalf of the constituents who are declaring such dissatisfaction?  Perhaps the difference between me and Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd is that I never joined that politically correct club.</P>

	<P>The historical incidence of the gerrymandering of constituencies in other jurisdictions &mdash; I do not refer to this State &mdash; has proved to be an unworthy endeavour which has caused serious problems for the democratic process.  It is absolutely unacceptable that this House should begin to interfere with the determination of the independent commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The commission puts forward a recommendation.  We can agree to change that recommendation on the basis of consensus.  What is the problem with that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be changed on the basis of the Government&rsquo;s recommendation?</P>

	<P>This debate could last all day.  I have called Deputy Charles Flanagan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I advise the T&aacute;naiste to exercise great care, having regard to the seat from which he rises, in proposing the establishment of an all-party committee with an input on constituency boundaries.  Any such committee would undoubtedly include a majority of Government Members.  The terms of reference of any such committee must be carefully considered.  This House should hesitate to go down that road.</P>
        <P>One of the most important items of proposed legislation heralded not only by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but also by the Taoiseach in recent times is the sale of alcohol Bill.  We were assured that proposals in this regard would be published before the end of March and that the legislation would be processed and enacted by this House before the summer recess.  However, the latest legislative programme distributed by the Government Chief <Col N="8"/>Whip indicates that publication of the Bill has been deferred to some time late this year.  What is the reason for this delay?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I understood from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform hopes to bring forward proposals on below-cost selling during this session.  It is my understanding that the more comprehensive general sale of alcohol legislation will be taken later.  The Minister is prioritising the below-cost selling aspect of the Holmes report which he received only this week, some four to six weeks after he commissioned it.  Yesterday&rsquo;s Official Report will clarify that point.</P>
        <P>I do not wish there to be any misunderstanding of my comments on the constituency issue.  I am simply making the point that if a political consensus can be devised, it is open to this House to modify a recommendation of the independent commission if it so wishes.  That is all I am saying.  Sometimes when we receive reports, we convince ourselves that we have no say in the matter.  Under the law, we have a say if we so wish.  If we cannot find agreement, there will be no change to the independent recommendation and the precedent will proceed.  Members on all sides of the House are aware of the problems and difficulties arising from this issue, including in the exalted constituency shared by Deputy Charles Flanagan and me.</P>

	<P>Property management companies are unregulated and uncontrolled, with young families being ripped off to the tune of some &euro;1,200 per year for no other service than to have the grass cut in their estates.  This problem is widespread in the new built-up estates in my constituency and elsewhere throughout the State.  The issue was debated at length in the House before the last election and we were given clear promises that legislation would be introduced.  We were told, however, that there was some complexity because three Departments would be involved and three separate Bills required.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is no indication in the new legislative programme that anything will be done about this before next October.  Before Christmas, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised primary legislation early this year, that is, in the last session.  Has the Government any intention of tackling this issue in respect of which Members on all sides of the House agree there is a requirement for statutory regulation and control?  There seems to be an incapacity to ensure the three Ministers concerned get this legislation through.  Why can this not be done quickly?  Everybody knows what the problem is and what the solution should be.  Legislation is required to implement that solution.</P>

        <P>The former US Senator, George Mitchell, played a crucial role in the Northern Ireland peace process.  When will the George Mitchell scholarship fund amendment Bill be introduced?  It is on the C list, rather than the A or B list.</P>
        <P>Can the T&aacute;naiste insist that funding be made available to alleviate the problems caused by the failure to bring the &ldquo;fair deal&rdquo; legislation before the House?  Such a Bill is needed in the short term to address the serious problems being faced by the elderly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the social housing Bill will be introduced in this session.  The heads of the George Mitchell scholarship fund Bill have not yet been prepared.  As it is on the C list, I would say that it will not be introduced until later this year, at the earliest.  The fund is in operation at the moment anyway.  The Office of the Attorney General is trying to work through some legal issues, as opposed to constitutional issues, which have to be ironed out in respect of the third Bill mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Two of the three Bills I would like to raise have just been mentioned by Deputy Crawford.  The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, has previously said that the Office of the Attorney General has highlighted legal difficulties with the section of the social housing miscellaneous provisions Bill that provides for the sale of council flats to tenants, which is a provision that has been outstanding for some time.  Given that the legislation is now due to be considered during this session, can I take it that the legal difficulties have been dealt with?  Do I understand correctly that a tenant purchase scheme, which is currently not available to those who live in flats, will be established on foot of the legislation?  When can local authorities expect to get such a mechanism up and running?</P><Col N="10"/>
        <P>On 14 December last, it was promised that a Green Paper on local government would be published.  We are still waiting for it to come before the House.  Can the T&aacute;naiste indicate when the House will receive the Green Paper?</P>
        <P>Deputy Crawford raised an issue that pertains to the Department of Health and Children.  I have been informed by officials in the southern HSE region that costs relating to subvention are completely ring-fenced so that they apply to the long-term residential care service.  Many people are unable to cope with the annual increases in nursing home costs because the subvention payments are frozen.

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the social housing miscellaneous provisions Bill will be introduced in this session.  The Green Paper on local government was discussed at Cabinet level this week.  I do not know when it will be published, but I assume it will be as soon as the discussions which comprise the deliberative process have been finalised and the requirements of the Official Languages Act 2003 have been met.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to give an example in support of Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s point about promised timescales for Bills not being met.  In last autumn&rsquo;s legislative programme, it was indicated that the national monuments Bill would be published in 2008, but the latest list suggests that it will not be published until 2009.  As Minister for Finance, the T&aacute;naiste must be concerned that this delay could cost the State money.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, said the other day he anticipates that this country will be fined by the EU as a result of its failure to transpose environmental law.  This legislation is one of the relevant Bills in that regard.  There is just one environmental Bill on the list for this session.  Surely the Government can bring forward the national monuments Bill as a matter of urgency.  The T&aacute;naiste said last month that constitutional issues had arisen in respect of the &ldquo;fair deal&rdquo; legislation.  If additional moneys are available as a result, perhaps they can be used to address the HSE&rsquo;s cuts in respite care in west Dublin.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The national monuments Bill will not be introduced in the House this year.  Deputies will probably have to wait until next year.  The problem is that many issues have to be considered by the Government when giving priority to legislation.  While all these Bills have their own individual merits, priority usually has to be attached to matters of more immediate concern.</P>

	<P>Where are the Bills?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Colleagues throughout the House have raised legislation relating to many issues, particularly health.  There were two Bills from the Department of Health and Children on the A list in the last session &mdash; the &ldquo;fair deal&rdquo; legislation and the adoption legislation, but neither of them was published.  They are on the list again this year.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, no longer answers questions in this Chamber.  She passes them all on to the HSE.</P>

	<P>This House does not get an opportunity to debate a wide range of health issues because the Minister does not introduce legislation and does not answer questions.  I am convinced that we need to have a broad-ranging debate on health in this House.  I refer to matters like patient safety, for example.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand this was dealt with yesterday, when the five items of legislation were asked about.  They are on the list and will be dealt with as soon as they are brought forward.  I do not see the purpose of raising this on a daily basis, since the answer was given yesterday.

	<P>I have another question and it is important.  This one impinges on the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s authority as Chairman of this House.  Recently I have noticed creeping into replies to parliamentary questions from various Departments the phrase, &ldquo;it is not usual to comment on individual cases&rdquo;.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Health and Children because this has appeared as regards a series of services provided by her Department.  It asked whether the Minister had given instructions to restrict the flow of information to individual Members of the House, and she said she had not.  However, the Data Protection Commissioner issued a guidance note for data controllers on the release of personal data to public representatives, in line with which the HSE has prepared its standard operational procedure.  Effectively, it is now a requirement for public representatives to get written confirmation from a constituent before he or she can make representation seeking a response. </P>
        <P>As the Ceann Comhairle knows, this is totally in breach of the rules of the Oireachtas and the privilege enjoyed by its Members.  I am asking for either a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, with the Data Protection Commissioner in attendance or the legislation to be amended, if necessary, because there are no circumstances in which an elected Member of the Oireachtas has to seek permission from anybody to raise a question about any subject that involves expenditure of any kind.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The motion being taken in Private Members&rsquo; time this week is slightly overshadowed, perhaps, by other political events, but is timely, nevertheless, and should be part of an ongoing debate in this country.  Sometimes it is easy to forget that the timeframe of Ireland&rsquo;s relative prosperity is very short, indeed.  We should never forget what &ldquo;the  good old days&rdquo; were like and none of us, either in Government or Opposition, wants to return to them.  This is most evident when we meet delegations from other countries who wonder how we managed to pull off what has become known internationally as the Celtic tiger.  A combination of factors were responsible, not just one.  Stability in Government was one and, as such, cannot be dismissed.  The rainbow Government made an enormous contribution.  I recall the heads of the institutes of technology talking to the then Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte about the lack of science places.  At that stage we were talking about computerisation, programming and the whole information technology sector.  They called for specific spaces to be put in place as regards science and recommended how it should be catered for within third level institutions.  I realised at the time that as long as we had academics such as the heads of the <Col N="16"/>institutes of technology who knew where the future lay and where the investment should be targeted, we should always be at the cutting edge when it came to employment and creating opportunities for our communities. </P>
        <P>I listen week after week in this House to debates on education in particular, as well as debates on disadvantage and justice.  I believe they are inextricably linked and one cannot be separated from the others.  A party colleague recently said that teachers in primary schools can now distinguish children who will have difficulties in later years as early as first class.  This is not a new phenomenon, as the Ceann Comhairle and I know, and it has always been the case.  I do not believe the theory, incidentally, that one can tell, at the age of six, whether a child will end up in jail.  Not all children who have difficulties or come from disadvantaged backgrounds end up in jail.  To suggest otherwise is to take forward planning to unsustainable levels.  Nonetheless, it is possible to tell which children will have difficulties because of their circumstances.  It is not always true that they will have difficulties because they come from disadvantaged areas, rather it is due to a combination of circumstances.  Given that we know this, I am always astonished that we have not yet managed to deal with the problems and resolve the issue.  Surely, if the problems can be detected early on, we should be planning a proper targeting of resources to ensure they do not continue.</P>
        <P>We will always have children with difficulties due to various causes, if not due to disadvantage.  This has a great deal to do with unemployment.  I see people who have been working, say, for eight or nine years and have never known unemployment except for short periods.  The unemployment they will encounter in the future, in the event, will be entirely different from what was experienced in the 1970s, 1980s and 1950s because the needs of people will have changed.  They will have mortgages and cars and children attending third level.  I sometimes make the point that the only education that does not have to be paid for is third level.  At other levels many people put their children into private primary and secondary schools.  This is ridiculous because the primary education system is quite good, in my opinion.  However, the type of unemployment they will meet will be entirely different from that encountered in the past.  Their needs will have changed and the type of debt ratio they are managing is entirely different.</P>
        <P>That is why there should be a permanent committee of the Oireachtas discussing on a continual basis how the economy is going and how people on a lower socio-economic level to bankers and construction bosses will deal with unemployment when it hits them.  The children who can be identified at age six as liable to encounter difficulties in the future will be the same people who will find themselves unskilled and unemployed when there is any type of economic downturn, and we should keep a close eye on that.  The slump is not inevitable but the changeover is in respect of needs.  We should surely be developing initiatives involving the State agencies that upskill and train employees, including F&Aacute;S, formerly AnCO.  It will be a question of promoting different skills, a different approach to employment, mobility and flexibility.  We should consider this as much as we consider those who find themselves unemployed.  In this respect, playing games with employment and job announcements is outrageous and disgraceful.</P>
        <P>Just before the 2002 general election, my husband was walking through Blackpool, where we live.  Where else would he be walking?  He was almost knocked down and said it would have been okay because the Taoiseach&rsquo;s car was involved.  It was part of a cavalcade on the way to Macroom on &ldquo;Golden Thursday&rdquo; to announce 300 additional jobs.  The day would have been fairly memorable in itself, therefore, had the near accident not happened.  The jobs announced were to be created by Elan in Macroom.  The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, was in the car with the Taoiseach.  The jobs were never created.</P><Col N="17"/>
        <P>On the same day, the T&aacute;naiste did a midlands tour that included Limerick.  A thousand jobs in total were announced but they never materialised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>

	<P>What company?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>There were three companies.</P>
        <P>Jobs are announced years before elections and sometimes they are never created, just like those announced before the election in 2002.  Kildare was promised 400 civil servants during that election campaign but never received them.</P>
        <P>In the 2007 general election campaign, there was a big announcement that Amgen would create jobs.  This was a particularly bad case as the announcement was a form of canvassing.  The then T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, said the creation of the jobs was a vote of confidence in the Irish economy but, behind all the rhetoric, she was really saying, &ldquo;Please vote for me because I am delivering these jobs&rdquo;.  The jobs were never created.  The head of the corporate sector in the United States was involved in regard to the announcement.  Cork County Council spent hundreds of thousands of euro putting in place infrastructure and on site preparation.  Will the council be reimbursed?  The Government should stop playing ducks and drakes with people&rsquo;s lives.  Ultimately, this is the result of making announcements to garner votes.  Employment and investment comprise a very serious subject and they determine how people live their lives.  We should be discussing them constantly, not just when considering Private Members&rsquo; motions.</P>

	<P>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach on his leadership of my party.  He was the seminal politician of his generation and, during his tenure as Taoiseach and party leader, he displayed considerable political and personal skills.  He will leave a great and unique legacy in terms of peace, prosperity, partnership and Ireland&rsquo;s standing internationally.  For this I compliment him and wish him the very best for the future.</P>
        <P>Any debate on the economy must be considered in the context of the deterioration of the economic climate over the past six to nine months.  Through intention, design and our own initiatives and strategies, we have transformed our economy from being insular and introverted to being perhaps the most open in the world.  We have an open trading island economy.  This has had considerable positive consequences but also negative ones.  Most economists agree unanimously that our strategy since the late 1950s has resulted in considerable benefits and premiums for the economy.  We are the true winners in terms of globalisation.  We have made it easy for companies to locate here and do business, and we have made it easy for Irish companies to invest abroad.  This has resulted in unprecedented growth in Ireland in recent years.</P><Col N="18"/>
        <P>Ireland is the envy of Europe and the world.  Our strategy, however, makes us subject to the vagaries of international economic circumstances.  The outlook is such that circumstances will be very difficult.  In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste, he identified in the Chamber this morning the international factors that could have adverse effects on our economy.  To dress these up as economic mismanagement in Ireland, as the motion seeks to do, is crude and unsophisticated and I do not agree with it.</P>
        <P>The international outlook is decidedly unsure.  This week, the chairman of the Federal Reserve System, Mr. Ben Bernanke, indicated for the first time that the United States may go into recession.  The European Central Bank indicated an interest rate drop is not on the cards for 12 months.  There is turbulence in the international financial markets.  Oil and commodity prices especially are rising.  German growth is projected to decrease to close to 0% this year.  All these factors pose serious challenges for our economy, yet this motion seeks, in a crude way, to dress up these challenges as domestic economic mismanagement.  The electorate did not buy that during the election campaign last May and will not do so this May or the one thereafter.  It is much too sophisticated to do so.  The motion is crude and does not deal with the real issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having mentioned the factors that pose challenges, it must be said that the strength and resilience of our economy place us in a good position from which to deal with the international circumstances.  Our workforce is much more flexible and skilled than it was ten years ago.  We are able to deal in a flexible and managed way with the international conditions that arise.  We would not have been able to deal with the current international shocks ten or 20 years ago because of the rigidity of our workforce and economy in that era.  The World Bank, in its report last week, regarded Ireland as the eighth best country in which to do business out of 178.  The respected publication <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> ranked Ireland&rsquo;s economy third out of 157.  This motion would have us believe that Ireland is the worst place in the world in which to do business.</P>
        <P>The motion notes that &ldquo;these jobs have been lost...as a direct result of flawed Government policies, notably the stimulation of a debt-fuelled housing bubble&rdquo;.  I disagree with this contention fundamentally because it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how the economy works.  What Fine Gael calls a &ldquo;debt-fuelled housing bubble&rdquo; is regarded as providing houses for an expanding economy and population on this side of the House.  The motion is misconstrued.  It calls on us to invest further in infrastructure and the national development plan but this is exactly what the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance signalled in his contribution this morning.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The motion refers to the need to upskill 500,000 people by 2020 and it is that aspect of it that I intend to address in my contribution.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to recount progress in recent years on Ireland&rsquo;s human capital development.</P>
        <P>The Government has continued the policy of successive Governments since the 1960s in investing heavily in education and training.  We have long recognised that the key to prosperity lies in our ability to continually meet changing and challenging global economic circumstances.  To effectively compete, our labour market needs the right mix of skills and competencies to rapidly respond to the changing business needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recognising that the issue of the economy&rsquo;s future skills needs will play an increasingly important role in determining future prosperity, the Government established the expert group on future skills needs in 1997.  Its purpose is to provide research-based advice on our future skills requirements and to make recommendations as to how these needs can be met effectively. <Col N="19"/> The group reflects the social partnership model, with members from enterprise, academia, Departments, and employer and employee groupings.</P>
        <P>The resulting expert group report, entitled Tomorrow&rsquo;s Skills &mdash; Towards a National Skills Strategy, was launched last year.  This strategy sets out clear long-term objectives for developing our human capital through upskilling, training and education for the period to 2020.  Its implementation will be central to ensuring that our education and training systems meet the future demands of industry in the medium to longer term.  In short, the national skills strategy will facilitate the development of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive advantage in terms of world-class skills, education and training.</P>
        <P>As this motion states, the national skills strategy&rsquo;s principle objective is for Ireland to upskill half a million people by at least one level on the national framework of qualifications over the period to 2020.  The strategy also contains several other objectives, which are key to the achievement of this principle objective.  These include the need to increase participation rates in upper secondary level education to 90%, and progression rates to third level to 70%.  We also need to facilitate the skills needs of the immigrant population and those wishing to re-enter employment.</P>
        <P>According to the national skills strategy, as the economy increases its dependence on services and high technology manufacturing, and traditional sectors such as agriculture decline in importance, there will be a corresponding change in the particular skills and balances needed in the economy.  The achievement of the targets and the vision contained in the national skills strategy will require an integrated approach, jointly led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Education and Science.  It will also be dependent on successfully involving all of the key agencies in the education and training sectors.</P>
        <P>I will personally chair an interdepartmental implementation group.  It will comprise senior officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Finance.  This group will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the national skills strategy.  It will convene for the first time later this month.</P>
        <P>While it is too early to give a precise description of the implementation plan, it will likely examine the existing provision of education and training and determine the key areas and initiatives that will require additional focus in order to achieve the objectives of the national skills strategy.  It will also determine the key benchmarks and targets that will be progressively monitored over the 12-year period to 2020.</P>
        <P>We are determined to implement this national skills strategy.  I am determined that the interdepartmental implementation group will work effectively to realise the objectives of the national skills strategy.  Given the positive commitment of all, no doubt measurable progress will continue to be a primary feature of our education and training systems in the years ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretConlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Margaret Conlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to comment on the amendment to the motion.</P>
        <P>It is important that certain key steps are taken to ensure that Ireland remains a highly competitive economy.  At the top of that agenda, there must be no delay in delivering the national development plan.  The Government has shown that it fully intends to do this, as evidenced by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in his December 2007 budget where he prioritised the plan.  It is necessary for the future development of our country and to meet future challenges.</P>
        <P>While the international economy is under pressure, especially with the weak dollar and sterling, Ireland is still performing well and it would be remiss of us to talk down our strengths. <Col N="20"/> Exports in Enterprise Ireland-supported enterprises grew by an annual average of 5.2% between 2000 and 2006, with export growth of 7% for the first half of 2007.  In the choppy waters of international trading conditions, exports grew to over &euro;154 billion in 2007 and the Government is committed to meeting the challenges head-on as they steer a steady ship.</P>
        <P>A new opportunity for the economy is coming via the strong number of skilled immigrants.  We should relax restrictions on immigrants who want to set up a business here in Ireland and contribute to the economy.  The Government has identified certain strategic gaps in the economy and it aims to fill these gaps through the effective implementation of new employment permits in the workforce by a new green card scheme.  We must keep going forward with such moves.  Cross-departmental synergy is required to tackle the problems for immigrants in getting loans, mortgages and credit via the Department of Finance, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister of State with responsibility for integration and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We must, through the social partnership process, convey to financial institutions the importance of them playing their part in the provision of credit lines to immigrants who wish to set up their own businesses.</P>
        <P>Another highlight for the economy and companies has been the highly successful recent trade missions led by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin.  Indeed, I was proud that Monaghan&rsquo;s Harte Peat was one of the major winners out of the South African trade mission.  This company is ambitious in its targets and aims to supply 35% of the mushroom industry in South Africa within the next 18 months.  It should be an inspiration to other companies, both in Monaghan and nationally, that the company can carve out such niches, both at home and abroad.  It is to be commended for its initiative and entrepreneurial spirit.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not to note the recent awful job losses at Grove Turkeys in Monaghan.  The loss of this high number of jobs in a rural setting would be the equivalent 1,000 or more job losses in one of our major cities, such is the ripple effect.  It is important that these indigenous industries are assisted at every level to meet the many challenges facing them on the international stage.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, it is important that the Government continues to work within the EU to ensure that Irish companies are not inadvertently put at risk compared to their European counterparts with the draft EU directive providing for derogations on equal treatment which could lead to different terms for enterprises in Ireland because of our different legal and industrial relations framework.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to research and development must be recognised.  This is one area where funding is targeted at businesses to ensure that they are able to keep product development at the top of their agenda.  This year, the Minister announced &euro;500 million in a simplified research and development scheme.  Ireland has improved in this regard; we were ranked fifth in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook last year.</P>
        <P>There are many challenges remaining for the economy.  The Government is tackling these issues and the Minister, Deputy Martin&rsquo;s, lead steps are to be welcomed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s permission, I wish to concur with the remarks made by Deputy Peter Power about the Taoiseach and to thank the Taoiseach for his enormous contribution to Ireland during his time in that office.  I received many messages this morning which I will convey to him.</P>
        <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak in favour of the Government amendment to the motion.  The motion states there has been an increase in the live register of 16,300 persons, but <Col N="21"/>it is important to note that the live register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It also includes part-time workers, those who work up to three days a week and seasonal and casual workers entitled to job-seekers benefit and allowance.  Unemployment is measured effectively by the Quarterly National Household Survey.  In that respect, the live register is a crude measure with which to gauge an economy, because it includes people who are working in various forms or who are entitled to benefits for part-time work.</P>
        <P>The mid-west region and County Limerick, my area, has suffered some job losses in recent years, but to the credit of the Government and this and previous Ministers we have policies in place which are effective at finding replacement jobs and industries for the region.  I note the Fine Gael motion does not mention any particular job losses in the area.  It mentions a number of areas around the country, but does not mention any in my constituency or within the mid-west region.  There have been job losses within the constituency, but the jobs were replaced.</P>
        <P>Recently, the local development agency, Shannon Development Company, in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, announced 250 jobs in Shannon with Zimmer and an additional 75 jobs with a health care company, Vistacon, in Limerick.  We also got good news through An Bord Plean&aacute;la that the Shannon LNG project has received planning permission at the Shannon Development land bank in Tarbert in north Kerry, which is adjacent to my constituency in Limerick.  That development will provide an estimated 650 construction jobs over a four year period and between 50 and 100 permanent jobs when the plant becomes operational.</P>
        <P>We must guard against talking our economy down.  In the previous severe recession in the UK, many commentators talked down the economy there and created significant hysteria.  We must guard against that happening here.  We are far from that scenario and the message should not go out from this House that we face that scenario.  IBEC is a fair-minded, independent organisation that represents over 7,000 employers and is on the record as stating that the level of investment being made by US companies here is staggering.  It stated that corporate America&rsquo;s investment position in Ireland was &euro;52.5 billion in 2006.  This is significantly ahead of investment by US companies in China, Russia, India and Brazil, which, combined, stands at &euro;45.6 million.</P>
        <P>From this point of view, we should not talk our economy down or send out the wrong message.  We must act responsibly.  The policies and principles are in place.  The Minister for Finance is well placed, through the Finance Acts, to take the hard and capable decisions needed.  We took the tough decisions after the general election in 2002 when the economy dipped a bit.  We are now in a similar scenario and will take the tough decisions to get the economy right and let it rebound.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to put on the record my gratitude to Deputy Bertie Ahern for his excellent work as Taoiseach since I entered D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and as leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  The people were asked to pass judgment on him in three general elections and each time they gave him a positive result.  I am sure that when historians come to write the book, they will make an equally positive assessment of his career.</P>
        <P>I am happy to support the Government position on this motion.  This is a bit of an unreal motion and I understand the Opposition had to scrape the barrel to find some subject to raise.  Ten years ago when I first joined the D&aacute;il there were 1 million people in the workforce.  Today there are 2.1 million people in it.  It has more than doubled in the past ten years.  Therefore, the economic perspective of people who put forward a motion such as this suggesting unemployment is a serious issue is very short term, probably about 30 seconds.  If they looked at the situation in the normal short, medium or long term, they would realise the motion has no standing.</P><Col N="22"/>
        <P>The Government takes a longer view of these issues and of the economic cycles here, abroad and internationally.  The Government is in power because it is in the position to take the necessary major long-term decisions.  There will always be ups and downs.  That is life.  We need a strong infrastructure to cope with the ups and downs and that is why the Government&rsquo;s emphasis on the national development plan is so important.  The plan will help not just the construction industry, but also improve our competitiveness.  One only has to look at the roads, Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Limerick, Dublin to Waterford, Dublin to Belfast or wherever.</P>

        <P>I want to refer now to a significant issue in my constituency.  There is no major multinational operation in my county, County Laois.  There has been a significant reduction in employment in housing construction and in investment in that area.  I believe this creates the ideal opportunity for Ireland and the people to redirect investment put into the housing market over the past five to ten years into new knowledge-based science and technology Irish companies.  Ireland has surprised itself in recent times.  We talk about the level of foreign direct investment in Ireland.  I estimate that from 9% to 10% of our workforce is employed by foreign multinationals, a maximum of 200,000 people.  In recent years the economy has been strong, whether as a result of the agri-sector and various other businesses working abroad, and has been a net foreign direct investor in the international community.  This is a sign we have matured as an economy.  Not only is there sufficient investment available from Irish people for Irish businesses in Ireland, there is also sufficient funding available for investment abroad.  There is an opportunity now for a return on this investment.</P>
        <P>The fact that housing is now available at a more competitive and realistic price will help people.  They will no longer have such large mortgages and it will be easier for them to pay them.  This will help with the economic situation.  The slowing down in the housing market is an opportunity for the funding that was in that market to be redirected to new companies.  In recent years, the property market was the business to be in and people did not look at other good investment and employment opportunities that were available locally.  I hope they will look more realistically at these now and thereby provide a better opportunity for local indigenous businesses to grow and prosper.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am appreciative of being allowed five minutes to speak in this crowded slot.  The amendment put down by the Government was well thought through and put together.  We have much to appreciate in respect of the Taoiseach.  The North and jobs are two main areas on which he will be judged.  I am happy to join others in paying tribute to him.  I draw attention, in particular, to the programme of investment in the services sector.  In the past, people were not inclined to give much credence to the services sector.  However, at the beginning of this decade it accounted for 20% of our exports and now it accounts for one third of them.  This is a significant improvement and we are well placed to reap the dividends.</P><Col N="23"/>
        <P>The national development plan is another example of progress.  When I heard somebody say yesterday that the Taoiseach had no vision, I smiled and thought of all the work he had put in on the national development plan.  It is a significant amount of work and its rewards are being reaped around the country.  Research and development &mdash; the strategy for science, technology and innovation formula &mdash; is a significant matter.  This fourth level of education, which is involved in research and development, is one in which the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, is hugely interested and has talked extensively about.  I hope that this will continue.  The national skills strategy is equally important.</P>
        <P>As the Opposition motion mentioned a firm in my own town, I will talk about it.  The firm, Nexans Ireland, is referred to last in a list of companies outlined in the motion.  I pay tribute to the firm which has been in Athlone for 36 years.  It began as Cable &amp; Wireless, became Alcatel and then became Nexans Ireland.  It has struggled at certain points in past years although not lately.  Staff relationships have been difficult but they have evened themselves out.  The new manager, Mr. Donegan, made a great effort.  He decreased the loss but at the end of the day, the financial figures were the reality and Nexans Ireland closed with the loss of 96 jobs.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, and the Department itself to look at an overall package of new employment opportunities for the former employees of Nexans Ireland.  There is no point in waiting until June when everyone will wonder what they are going to do.  I would like to see a well thought-out upskilling project put in place because there is a long tradition of manufacturing in Athlone.  I am well aware that manufacturing must now reach the higher level if we are to keep our pre-eminence in that regard.  I ask for a properly thought out skills and redeployment package within the area.  I thank the workers for their work over the years.  Thirty-six years is a fair spell of time for a firm to last in a town.  Equally, I thank the firm for its commitment to its workers.  It has been a very fine industry and I understand very clearly the anguish suffered by those who have lost their jobs.</P>
        <P>I am also very glad to see that the Department and Minister are pursuing an equally vigorous campaign for workers&rsquo; rights.  People say that the minimum wage will ruin us all but that is not true.  There is no point in having all of the steps in place if workers&rsquo; rights are not recognised.  The trade union movement in Ireland is right to concentrate on that matter.  The National Employment Rights Authority is very useful in this regard.  One can telephone it with one&rsquo;s number and discover what one&rsquo;s rights are, as well as ascertaining information about various other matters.  The exploitation which has been carried out in the past will no longer be entertained.  I can only be very glad to note that and to hope that this proactive approach on the double track will continue.</P>
        <P>I make a final plea to the Department, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  I see that key targets are set during 2008 for the pharmaceutical, bio-pharmaceutical and medical technologies areas.  We are very well poised and placed and have benefited from innovative developments in those areas.  I make a straightforward plea for strong consideration to be given to developments in those three areas.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="24"/>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking in support of the motion moved by Fine Gael.  It is a very real motion based on fact and the situation in which this country finds itself in terms of financial deterioration and certainly deterioration in the unemployment figures.  There is an unemployment rate of 5.2%, which is the highest it has been in seven years.  Those of us who were looking for work in the 1980s would think a rate of 5.2% is a reasonable figure but we are dealing with a situation where the unemployment rate is at its highest growth rate in the past 25 years.  </P>
        <P>People who lose their jobs are not just statistics.  We are citing a considerable amount of statistics here today, myself included.  However, we should recognise that they are real people who find themselves without a job and, in many cases, are not sure what the future holds.  Perhaps they have a low level of skills or are in an age bracket which the market does not appear to demand.</P>
        <P>In many ways, we are victims of our dependence on construction.  The cost of manufacturing in this country is very high and many who have gone through our education system have poor skills attainment.  We are told that the unemployment rate will increase this year.  The ESRI predicted that it will reach 6.2%.  The Department of Finance has predicted that in a few months time, the number of people who will be unemployed in this country will be more than 200,000.  The jobs that are being lost, which are listed in the motion, are certainly not being replaced to the same extent.  I noticed that the Government&rsquo;s amendment mentioned 11 job announcements.  This adds up to 1,150 jobs.  A total of 1,100 jobs were promised in the Cork region through Amgen.  I know it has been mentioned here by Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  The jobs in Amgen never arrived.  That puts job creation versus job losses into context.</P>
        <P>Headlines in yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers showed that redundancies were up by 21% in the first three months of this year.  The construction and manufacturing and services sectors have borne the brunt of these losses.  A total of 699 jobs in the services sector were lost in March, which brings the number of redundancies in this area up to 2,320.  The situation is worse in manufacturing and is similar in construction.  Jobs have been lost there, bringing the numbers up to over 2,000 for the first three months of this year.</P>
        <P>We also know that the manufacturing sector is continuing to contract.  There has been a reduction in orders and an increase in costs.  We hear that Ireland is becoming an expensive country in which to operate.  These costs can be directly affected by Government action but have not been affected.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I heard the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance speaking on the Order of Business this morning and he mentioned the phrases &ldquo;deteriorating financial situation globally&rdquo; and the &ldquo;high price of oil&rdquo;.  He spoke as if the matter is outside his control, he can do nothing about it and outside influences are coming to bear here.  That is not true.  For the past number of years, we have been over dependent on a construction industry that is now in a downturn.  The Government was happy to sit back and let the money roll in from capital gains tax and VAT returns.  It was an easy number.  All the Government had to do was sit there and preside over it yet we now see the downturn in the construction industry and the direct effect it is having on tax revenues.  Yesterday, we saw another poor headline which showed that tax revenues were down &euro;600 million in the three months since the budget.  They are down almost &euro;700 million on this time last year due to a drop in capitals gains tax and VAT returns.</P>
        <P>I would speak for the next 30 minutes if I could.  I am not saying it is all doom and gloom.  I just wanted to make the strong point that the country has been mismanaged.  We have been over dependent on the construction industry.  Transport 21 is behind schedule.  We need to invest in infrastructure to ensure that our competitiveness can be regained and that we do not <Col N="25"/>slip further in this area.  We also need to encourage and develop competition in our energy sector, an area for which the Government is, again, directly responsible.  I could go on and talk about waste, environmental and water charges.  I know that these charges are necessary.  However, they are not controlled and are an excessive cost on business.  I am sure the Minister of State knows that in his capacity.  These are factors that could be controlled by the Government but have been neglected.  We are now paying the price for that neglect.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Varadkar for tabling this motion.  To contradict Deputy Fleming it is not scraping the bottom of the barrel, but it is very relevant and pertinent motion.  From dealings in my constituency I believe it is the most important debate we need to have in this House.  While facts and figures might seem like scaremongering to some people, it is the reality with which we are faced.  The vacuum that has been created did not happen overnight, or as a result of the events of 11 September 2001 or other global factors.  In my county in the north west for many years the textile manufacturing industry was the bread and butter.  With the decline in the manufacturing sector in the mid to late 1990s we needed to move on and embrace new areas of employment and initiatives.</P>
        <P>In 1999 the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, launched a task force report as a result of the major job losses in Fruit of the Loom and in the textile manufacturing industry which set out an ambitious target, which was welcome at the time, of trying to create new jobs in new environments.  That task force was launched in 1999.  It was followed by another task force initiated by the Minister, Deputy Martin.  An interdepartmental report was published in 2002 covering problems that were not solved leading to high unemployment levels in County Donegal.  The construction industry filled the vacuum in County Donegal after the loss of the textile industry, through not just direct construction jobs but also in ancillary services associated with the construction sector.</P>
        <P>I will focus on my constituency because Deputy McGinley will focus on Donegal South-West, which has similar problems.  The live register figures in Buncrana in February 2008 show a marked increase over 2007 for the under 25 male category.  There was a 50% increase in unemployment between 2007 and 2008 for males under 25 in that area.  That is symptomatic of what is happening around the county and the country, and we need to deal with it.  It is not just a question of us on this side of the House raising the issue because there is a problem: we also have solutions to these problems.  It is important that we address them immediately internally.  I was somewhat disappointed by the T&aacute;naiste blaming everything on international issues, including the exchange rate with the US dollar and saying that it was not our problem.  It is not just that.  Those working in small to medium enterprises and the representative bodies ISME and IBEC keep referring to competitiveness.  We are in charge of our own competitiveness regarding ESB costs, telecommunications costs and other costs that we can control internally.</P>
        <P>I sat on the National Economic Social Forum and there are solutions within that document.  There are barriers to entry.  Solutions were proposed for a more inclusive labour market, which need to be implemented.  That is something we can look towards.  Our peripherality is an issue and with an ever-expanding European Union the centre of Europe is moving further from us.  We need solutions in terms of advancing the infrastructure of our ports.  For the north west we need to consider the ports at Belfast and Lisahally in County Derry for integrated freight transport.</P>
        <P>Deputy Conlon said we should not be scaremongering in this House and sending out negative signals.  That is not our job.  Our job as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la is to be messengers for the people.  As a messenger of the people, I spoke to a woman this morning whose son was forced to go to <Col N="26"/>London to work.  That is the reality and the message we need to bring to the House.  It is not just about scaremongering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Last December the Opposition warned the House of the impending economic crisis.  At the time the Minister, Deputy Martin, said he believed the economy was continuing to show many signs of strength and that the figures showed employment levels were high and rising.  We were accused of being the prophets of doom yet the statistical analysis shows that Ireland&rsquo;s economy is facing its greatest challenge in more than 20 years.  The tremor permeating through the world&rsquo;s stock markets, the downturn in the US economy, and the consistent and rapid fuel price increases, all compound to put the Irish economy under pressure.</P>
        <P>The latest quarterly economic report from the ESRI warned that economic growth is set to fall dramatically this year from 4.6% last year to 1.6% with no net gain expected in the number of jobs created.  During the debate on the Private Members&rsquo; motion in December I warned of impending job losses in the mid-west region and if the Government ignored them it would be at its peril.  In the interim, we have had the welcome news from Shannon Development of the planned creation of 250 skilled jobs with Zimmer Holdings Incorporated setting up a medical devices facility in the Shannon Free Zone.  This is the scale of the investment we need in the Shannon Free Zone.  However, while we welcome this good news, there have been many job losses in the region in recent years.  Another potential blow is on the horizon this week with the news that Unbrako Europe SPS is being taken over by a US company, resulting in fears for the future of the 80 jobs at this facility.</P>
        <P>The live register figures provide the statistical proof if any was needed that jobs are haemorrhaging in County Clare.  The live register figures in the mid-west region have increased by a staggering 15.3% according to CSO figures at the end of December 2007.  This increase in unemployment is hitting homes in many corners of the county.  The figure for Ennis, which is becoming a dormitory town because people are travelling from the town to work in Galway, Shannon and Limerick, has increased by 14.56%.  In north Clare, in Ennistymon the figure has increased by 15.61% and in Tulla it has increased by 23.21%.  In west Clare the figure has increased by 12%.  This trend continues in to 2008, with an extra 823 Clare people signing on last month.  The Forf&aacute;s annual employment survey confirms that the mid-west is losing out.  The share of agency-supported employment by region shows a reduction of 1.8% in the mid-west region.</P>
        <P>If the mid-west region is to continue to be attractive for inward and indigenous investment then urgent action must be taken.  How many more warning signs does this Government need?  Key to addressing the decline is investing in our infrastructure.  Paying lip service to promises of balanced regional development is not good enough in a region that is just not getting the jobs.  Last year our region lost the connection to Heathrow, which was a major blow to many of the industrialists in the region.  This week the open skies agreement between the EU and US came into force which will provide its own challenges.  Instead of delivering on commitments to provide a major marketing fund to cushion the blow of open skies for the region we have a watering down of this commitment.  Watering down marketing funding is not acceptable given the weakness of the US dollar.</P>
        <P>Large digital black spots remain throughout County Clare and the new network generation has still not been rolled out.  During this Government&rsquo;s watch, Ireland&rsquo;s position in the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s global competitiveness list has dropped from fifth to 22nd place.</P>
        <P>Former US President, Mr. John F. Kennedy said that &ldquo;economic policy can result from government inaction as well as governmental action&rdquo;.  It is time for the Government to step up <Col N="27"/>to the plate or its legacy will be that Ireland&rsquo;s position in the global economy will continue to decline.  I urge the Government to support the Fine Gael motion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this very important motion and thank my colleague, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for tabling it.  As Deputy McHugh said, it is not up to us to talk down our economy.  We should be coming into this House and talking up our economy.  Unfortunately, however, the way our economy has gone in the last year or two, we have had no choice but to tell the facts as they are.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that many Deputies on the other side of the House agree with the Fine Gael motion and the sentiments expressed by the Fine Gael speakers regarding the direction our economy has taken.  If one examines the construction industry, for example, my county of Wexford has been totally dependent on that industry for the past number of years.  A number of factories have closed in County Wexford and have not been replaced, especially in Wexford town and Enniscorthy.  These included electronics and manufacturing plants.  Hundreds of jobs have been lost.  Rosslare Europort is located in County Wexford but it is not being used to its full capacity.  I blame the Government, particularly the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, for not utilising County Wexford, and particularly the Rosslare Europort to its full potential.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, attended a recent launch by Aircon Engineering, at which I was also present and saw at first hand what that company has achieved.  It is a committed Irish company which did not receive any help from IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Government or any semi-State organisation.  The staff worked hard themselves.  The company started with approximately 20 employees, has grown over the last ten years and is now employing upwards of 150 people.  That company was started by genuine people who have worked hard to get where they are today and who received no hand-outs.  At the same time, there are companies coming into the country which receive hand-outs.  However, when our competitiveness changes, labour costs rise, energy prices increase or our infrastructure, including broadband, does not develop, they leave.  They leave because they are not being genuinely looked after by the Government.  While it is wonderful to see foreign direct investment in the country, it is important that foreign companies are looked after.</P>
        <P>Deputy Breen spoke about the unemployment figures in County Clare but the figures for County Wexford are far more staggering.  In the past 12 months there has been a 23% rise in the numbers on the live register.  That is an absolute shame, particularly in the context of the buoyant economy that we have enjoyed for the past number of years.  There has been a 25% increase in the live register figures in Enniscorthy.  While Enniscorthy is not a major town by any measure, the fact that 25% more people have gone onto the live register there in the last 12 months tells its own story.</P>
        <P>County Wexford has been totally reliant on the construction industry over the past number of years.  Anyone who visits Wexford will see the vast amount of houses and other buildings that have been developed there.  Often when people spoke to me about the construction industry in England and the fact that it declined overnight, I argued that it could not happen here.  However, that is exactly what has happened in Ireland and in Wexford in particular.</P>
        <P>Last weekend I called on the Government to set up a task force.  However, I have spoken to Deputies from various other counties in which task forces are already in place who have told me they have made absolutely no difference.  If a task force is to be set up in Wexford, it must have teeth.  It must make a difference and be a forum in which people are listened to but unfortunately, this Government has not listened to the people of Wexford for the past number of years.  The number of additional people on the live register there tells its own story.</P><Col N="28"/>
        <P>It is sad for me to see people having to draw the dole or the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance who genuinely want to work.  Deputy McHugh made reference to a person who had to go back to England to find work.  Are we going back to those old days again, where people had to emigrate to find work?  I ask the Government to give serious consideration to what is happening.  I urge it not to deny what is occurring.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words on this very important motion.</P>
        <P>Unemployment is at a seven year high, at 5.2%.  Transport infrastructure and broadband are at a disastrous state of development.  No matter where one goes &mdash; any village, in any constituency, right across the country &mdash; broadband availability is an issue.</P>
        <P>The unemployment figures for four towns in Tipperary are stark.  In Cahir, unemployment is up by 14%, in Carrick-on-Suir, by 11.7%, in Cashel, by 18.4% and in Clonmel, by an incredible 31.4% .  The motion makes specific reference to the closure of one industry in Clonmel, namely Merriott Radiators, a company that has been in the town for many years.</P>
        <P>These figures are incredible but we have heard speaker after speaker defending the actions of the Government.  Everyone knows that oil prices can rise and we cannot do very much about that.  However, there are areas on which the Government certainly can take action and the provision of broadband is one.  We should hang our heads in shame at what is happening with regard to broadband in this country.  Local service charges are also increasing every year.  Small businesses in this State are finding that local service charges, which are increasing much faster than the rate of inflation, are putting pressure on their operations.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer back to Merriott Radiators in Clonmel.  That company transferred its operations to Wales.  Why did that happen?  It is shameful that the company which had a good and committed workforce who gave it more than 30 years of service, would simply leave and go across the water to another State.  Surely there is something wrong in a country that allows that to happen and something amiss with a Government that does not stand up, examine itself and examine its policies in the face of such events.</P>
        <P>Last week in Clonmel, Marlbrook Hotels, which had huge plans to build a golf course, hotel and housing, has put its plans on ice because of the current economic climate.  It is afraid to expand and develop and has put all of its ambitious plans on hold.  At the same time, the Government sits and says that everything is fine but it is not living in the real world.  I beg the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, who knows South Tipperary, to examine what is happening there in the next number of months.</P>
        <P>Last week the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, visited Tipperary Co-Op, one of the finest companies in the country.  It is a top of the range cheese production facility.  It is an excellent facility but where are the producers gone?  The farmers who produce the milk are all gone from the land.  Five miles down the road from the co-op, Rockwell Agricultural College has closed because there are no young people on the land of Ireland.  Tipperary Co-Op is a fabulous facility.  We have been told that demand for food is rising and markets for cheese are opening up all the time.  People all over the world are anxious to buy Irish food but where are the producers to produce it?</P>
        <P>I ask the Government to stop in its tracks, to think carefully, examine what is happening outside Dublin and acknowledge that there is unemployment in the country.</P>
        <P>An advance factory opened in Tipperary town but for seven years there has not been one ministerial visit or IDA promotion of that facility.  It is disgraceful.  The Government should hang its head in shame at what it is doing to Tipperary, the premier county.  I urge the Minister <Col N="29"/>of State to come and help us out.  He is not living very far away and I know he understands the way we think and the fact that we want to get on and deal with this important issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>A discussion on unemployment is appropriate, opportune and timely.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, on tabling the motion and on the research he conducted in framing it.  Once again, unemployment is escalating and the unemployment rate is currently 5.2%.  Former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, who was a decent man, said any Government that allowed unemployment to exceed 100,000 should not be in office.  Perhaps the Minister of State or Deputy Varadkar will not recall that statement but the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will.  The Government is trying to defend a scenario where almost 200,000 people are unemployed and I cannot understand how any Government could defend that position.</P>
        <P>Many jobs were created over the past ten years and the Government&rsquo;s amendment refers to 500,000 but a balanced geographic spread has not been achieved in job creation.  I refer to my constituency and county where over the past ten years 12,000 manufacturing jobs were lost, which must be a record.  Deputy McHugh referred to the task force that was established.  It undertook to create 1,000 new jobs annually between 1998 and 2007 but only 1,000 manufacturing jobs were created to replace the jobs lost at Fruit of the Loom, which straddled both constituencies in County Donegal, and the 600 jobs lost at Hospira in Donegal town.  In my own area of Gweedore in the Gaeltacht, 1,000 industrial jobs were lost.  The latest information suggests the unemployment rate is on the increase again in the county, which is much higher than the national average.</P>
        <P>A number of weeks ago, the CSO indicated Donegal has the lowest <i>per capita</i> income on a county basis in Ireland and the highest unemployment.  We must all realise the strong correlation between unemployment and <i>per capita</i> income.  Why should a tax incentive not be extended to industrialists, entrepreneurs and investors to set up in Donegal similar to the incentives offered to set up in the upper Shannon basin, which covers County Leitrim, the only county in the Republic that borders County Donegal, and the mid-Shannon basis in the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance&rsquo;s constituency?  Unless something imaginative such as this is done, the problems we have will not be addressed.  County Donegal has a workforce, excellent educational facilities and a good infrastructure.  We have everything except the will of the Government and the Department to look after the employment needs of many people in the county.</P>

	<P>I join with my Government colleagues who placed on record their appreciation for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s contribution to expanding the economy from 1997 onwards and to peace and prosperity.  The foundations were laid during that time for the changing economy and for us looking outward with confidence to build business at home and to attract foreign direct investment.  I wish him well in whatever role he takes up in the future.  I also thank him for his contribution to Irish politics, on which we will have an opportunity at another stage to deliberate in a more expansive way.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Fine Gael on tabling the motion.  The party is consistent and its members have their heads stuck even deeper in the sand.  The previous occasion we discussed a similar motion tabled by Deputy Varadkar, the same speakers adopted the same negative tone regarding all sectors of business.  They have little to offer on developing business policy and they also refused to recognise the enormous contribution being made by the SME sector, with the exception of Deputy Kehoe who referred to Air-Con Group Ltd. in his own constituency.  Every Member has made a complaint relating to his or her own constituency but they put forward very few solutions.</P>

	<P>Fine Gael Members failed to acknowledge the role of the SME sector and how fast it is expanding.  Men and women get up in their thousands every day to make decisions on job creation and investment.  Air-Con Group Ltd. is a typical example.  In spite of what Fine Gael says, that company&rsquo;s managers would not base their decisions on the party&rsquo;s analysis.  Their glass is half full, not half empty, and they decided on the basis of how the Government is developing policies to sustain job creation and investment to invest in their own business.  Thousands of similar companies make that choice every day.  They are investing to create employment and they take risks we, in this House, do not have to take.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government must give consideration to job losses, the issues involved and the new challenges.  It is ridiculous for every Opposition Member to say globalisation, energy costs, job movement, offshoring and downsizing are only affecting Ireland.  We must create and implement policies to give us the edge in job creation and investment.  Fine Gael has forgotten that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The policies successive Governments have put in place since 1997 ensured exports increased by 7% or &euro;157 billion last year and our strategy in developing markets in Asia has resulted in a rapid increase in trade to that region of between 30% and 40%.  I accompany representatives of Irish companies on trade delegations to those markets and they have consistently punched above their weight.  They are doing business in diverse economies such as the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Canada and the US.  Irish companies are ranked tenth in job creation in America and the pay off for this investment is jobs that are being sustained domestically.  Fine Gael fails to recognise that, which is unfair to those who take these risks.</P>
        <P>I refer to Deputy Ring&rsquo;s comments on enterprise boards.  He stated everything is done for foreigners who invest in Ireland but refused to acknowledge the fact that 21 businesses received grants amounting to &euro;500,000 in County Mayo in 2007.  The same happened in County Kilkenny, while 26 companies received &euro;600,000 in County Kildare.  Deputy Varadkar referred to upskilling the workforce.  Enterprise boards are making significant investment in sustainable, indigenous jobs in every county and they have on record companies who continually return to them for assistance in education and training for both their employees and managers.</P>
        <P>Recently the House debated the world trade talks for two days and no Opposition trade spokesperson made a contribution.  That says a great deal about the Opposition&rsquo;s policies and future outlook for this country.  It is essential Ireland achieves a good deal in those talks.  I am glad a number of Opposition agriculture spokespersons support the Government&rsquo;s approach but Fine Gael Members fail to see the future in the context of those talks.  They should be ashamed of themselves for coming into the House week in, week out saying the same thing without acknowledging the positive aspects to the economy.</P>

	<P>What about the people with no jobs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity I was not in before the Minister of State because I also wish to speak about small businesses and SMEs.  This area should be a major focus of the Government with regard to job creation, particularly over the coming years.  I know we have had successes but we have not had enough.  I am glad the Minister of State mentioned it because I totally agree with him.  This is where we will solve our job problems and create many jobs.</P><Col N="31"/>
        <P>It is true that many opportunities for job creation could and do exist within the SME sector.  Unfortunately, several unnecessary barriers to expansion block any such job creation prospects and these need to be tackled.  According to a recent ISME survey, business confidence in Ireland has plummeted to a four year low.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach spoke about confidence in the country.  We have problems and we must recognise them.</P>
        <P>Small businesses, particularly in the distribution, retail and construction sectors are markedly less optimistic about the prospects for the economy than they were a year ago.  The slowdown in the housing market and construction sector and the continuing erosion of competitiveness are certainly feeding the mood of gloom.  We need to restore their confidence with a new strong Government with a new game plan to tackle the challenges and problems with real targets and solutions and not just with fancy PR.</P>
        <P>These problems include the cost of doing business, problems with local government, red tape from European and national laws and planning delays on which we had a good discussion previously with the Minister of State.  I am glad the Minister of State is willing to discuss this with committees because major problems exist which we need to fix to open up opportunities for small business.  Other problems include levies and charges on people, infrastructural problems with roads and bridges, parking problems in towns and the cost of buying a site at which to conduct business.  The lack of grants is also a problem for many small businesses.  The enterprise boards do great work but only in certain sectors.</P>
        <P>Many people with good ideas for job creation do not get the chance to enact them.  We need to expand the grants available to them or at least to give them more incentives such as fewer rates, taxes and charges in the first three or four years.  The Minister of State is a businessman and he knows the first one or two years in business are extremely difficult, particularly when one begins to pay tax 18 months down the road.  This is when cash problems hit.  If we are really to help these businesses to create jobs this is where we must do so.</P>
        <P>I mentioned high costs are a barrier.  The cost of doing business in Ireland has increased significantly due to a mixture of high inflation, strong growth in wages, in particular public sector wages, increases in the cost of State and local council services and a greater burden of regulation.  As the cost of doing business rises, the cost of expansion and growth rises.  Without expansion and growth we will have no increase in employment levels in Irish SMEs.  In fact, unemployment will continue to rise.</P>
        <P>What has been driving Ireland&rsquo;s high rate of inflation?  The cost of water, refuse and miscellaneous services increased by more than 200%.  The cost of electricity rose by more than 50% and motor tax by almost 30%.  The list goes on.  All of these prices and  increases can be fixed by Government because they are related to Government and local government.  We must hone in and try to make major changes urgently.  To do so will mean tough decisions being taken by Government.  I believe people in the Government can do this and our job will be to force them to do so.  To continue to put heads in the sands and deny there is a problem is wrong.  We need a new and strong plan to fix these problems.</P>
        <P>With regard to infrastructure, apart from roads, rail and bridges, broadband is a key area for job creation.  It is an area in which the Government has failed.  We have not moved as fast as we should have.  Ireland&rsquo;s broadband penetration rate is only 17.4% according to the EU&rsquo;s information society and media department.  The EU average is 20%.  One might suggest that 20% would be good enough and our previous aim was to attain the EU average.  This is not good enough when we see other countries such as Denmark which is at 35.6%, Finland at almost 35% and the Netherlands which also has 35% penetration.  France is higher again.  We are behind in this area and it has serious effects for business, particularly the small business sector, as well as for education.</P><Col N="32"/>
        <P>The roll-out of the metropolitan area networks, MANs, nationwide has been extremely tardy and instead of the Government stepping up its investment in this, it has delayed the roll-out of the second phase until it reviews the first phase.  It is always about reviewing, waiting and pilot schemes.  We need to move forward.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s news is dominated by one story.  However, other news stories are in the newspapers today.  In today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, John Mulligan rightly points out in his review of Ireland&rsquo;s broadband offerings that the MAN review is due for imminent release.  However, the networks essentially replicate existing Eircom infrastructure.  Where is the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources planning to go with this MAN scheme?  When it is in place we must ensure local and home-based businesses can tap into it and use it.  It has not moved quickly enough and now seems to be only following Eircom.  I know in some cases, Eircom has followed the Government with regard to its plans and where to go with broadband but we must tackle this.</P>
        <P>It is time to up the game with regard to the penetration, speeds and cost of broadband in Ireland because if this Government does not act, vital opportunities for start-up businesses and job creation will be lost.  Many existing companies will not be able to expand without this technology.  New job opportunities will be missed.  This debate encompasses many other areas.  I concur with the Minister of State that we must focus and do all we can to help Ireland&rsquo;s small and medium sized businesses.  They are the backbone of society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending today&rsquo;s debate.  I welcome his commitment to small industry.  If he wishes to discuss negativity, I would like him to read through some of the D&aacute;il debates from 1995 and 1996.  I well remember those times when Nora Owen was accused of almost every murder which took place.  We have a right in Opposition to raise issues.  Deputy McGuinness did so extremely well from his own back bench prior to becoming a Minister of State.  </P>
        <P>The recent Forf&aacute;s annual employment survey clearly shows how the Border region, part of which I represent, has lost out from the failure of Government and Government agencies to invest in the region.  High end, high paying jobs are in the main concentrated in urban areas such as Dublin and Cork.  The constituency of Cavan-Monaghan has been extremely dependent on the furniture and food industries.  Furniture has lost out to the Far East and the food industry has been seriously affected by unlabelled imports or products, the quality of which cannot be guaranteed, such as beef from Brazil.  Grove Farm in Smithborough is a victim of Government failure with regard to food labelling.  I warned the Government and the Taoiseach in this Chamber with regard to this eight years ago.</P>
        <P>It is disappointing that the ten years since the Good Friday Agreement have shown a drop from 10.3% of agency supported workers in the Border region in 1998 to 6.4% in 2007.  In total, from February 2007 to February 2008, 1,000 extra people have signed on for social welfare in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, never mind the large number of those who have lost their jobs since February, such as those in Grove Farm and the building trade.  A large number of foreign workers who were paying PRSI and PAYE have gone elsewhere since they lost jobs in the building industry.  Large numbers were employed in industries such as timber framed houses and Kingspan related building industries.</P>
        <P>In light of the present failures of the Government to utilise the benefits of the peace process, it must reconsider the lack of support for local industry, such as the lack of broadband in rural areas.  One company in a village in County Cavan employs 23 people.  It needs to do business on-line but broadband is not available and it cannot even get an idea from Eircom as to when it might be possible.  Tourism has great potential in the Border region, in areas such as Castle<Col N="33"/>leslie and Glaslough.  We have top quality hotels in every town in Cavan and Monaghan.  However, it is hardly on the map for tourism as far as F&aacute;ilte Ireland is concerned.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>A previous speaker mentioned the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and a cheese factory in the deep south.  One of the biggest disappointments in our area was that every co-op in the northern region from Donegal to the west to Cavan-Monaghan came together to instigate a cheese plant, sought grant aid and were refused.  This is an indication of where Government thinking must change.  The Government must remain committed to the Border region.  I recognise and accept the Taoiseach was committed to the peace process but his Ministers must follow on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s contribution to the debate yesterday was measured in contrast with the contribution made this morning by the Minister of State.  Given the week that is in it, I will continue in that tone.  </P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Minister drew attention to the fact that the number of people in employment has increased from 1 million to 2 million during the past ten years.  I acknowledge that achievement.  He also stated that while there will always be job losses, the key test is whether the Government can replace lost jobs with new ones.  I agree that the role of Government is to create the right environment for employment rather than simply to create jobs.</P>
        <P>When I hear Ministers and Deputies opposite speak about all that has been achieved I am concerned that they have become complacent or are in denial.  Deputy Fleming said Fine Gael is scraping the bottom of the barrel with this motion and Deputy Collins said we are scaremongering.  This is a real issue that cannot be ignored.  The standardised unemployment rate has increased from 3.7% to 5.2% and is still rising.  This is significant and cannot be denied, ignored or dismissed.</P>
        <P>The number of people signing on since the current Government took office has increased by 20,000.  One cannot simply dismiss this and deny or pretend a real problem does not exist.  There has been much mention of the external challenges facing the economy.  I recognise external challenges exist in respect of the falling dollar, rising oil prices and the credit crunch, but what we in this House should be discussing is the internal challenges facing us and why they have not been addressed by the Government, an issue about which Members opposite have had little to say.  The Government appears to have no agenda or reforms on the horizon.  The more reform needed, the more the Government runs away from it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said that we had not mentioned small and medium enterprises, which is untrue.  Most contributors from this side of the House spoke about small and medium enterprises.  The matter is specifically referred to in the motion.  He also stated that we are offering only negativity and not solutions.  We have put forward many solutions and, perhaps, I can provide some more for the Minister of State.  If he is genuinely interested in assisting small and medium sized enterprises he could bring about a renewed focus on regulation and reducing the cost of regulation.</P>
        <P>The employment law compliance Bill will shortly come before the House.  While I have not yet seen any regulatory impact assessments &mdash; I am not sure if they have been done &mdash; huge elements of that Bill will increase significantly the regulatory burden on business.  The Government has, year on year, increased the amount of red tape in this area and made it more difficult and costly for small businesses to function.  While large businesses can afford to employ a person whose job it is to ensure they are compliant with all the legislation, small businesses cannot afford to do so.  Often, small businesses are forced to spend hours on end and enormous amounts of money to comply with the body of legislation that exists.  This is an area which the <Col N="34"/>Minister of State could address by, say, setting targets for these companies.  The Minister promised several times to do this but has not yet done so.  He could opt to use the standards cost model used in other countries for the purpose of assessment.  The Government cannot run away from this issue.</P>
        <P>The issue of inflation was not addressed by Members opposite.  The Government has given no commitment to address the issue of local authority charges, the deregulation of waste collection, tolling or to reduce the cost of doing business, which is what is driving the SME sector down and jobs out of the country.  Very little was said about upskilling, labour market reforms and infrastructure.  For example, why are we not following the model used by Denmark, which has a much higher participation labour force than Ireland?  While many Members on this side of the House spoke about broadband, Members on the opposite side had almost nothing to say about it.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred yesterday to migration and green cards.  The green card system is a start but it is not what we need.  We need something much broader and more radical than the green card scheme if we are to attract highly skilled people into our economy.  These are the types of solutions we would like to see.  The Government cannot simply rest on its laurels and tell everyone how great matters have been for the past ten years because that is not the solution.  The economy has changed and factors are different than they were even three or four years ago.  What we need from Government is less denial and self-congratulation.  It should take its head out of the sand and implement the policies needed to restore confidence to business.  If it does that, we will support it.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The main aims of the Lisbon reform treaty, as spelled out in its preamble, are to enhance the efficiency and the democratic legitimacy of the Union.  This treaty is different from  those that went before it. <Col N="36"/> It was not produced behind closed doors, rather it was crafted in public.  The reform treaty is not, as some would have us believe, the work of fevered minds with no mandate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This treaty finds its origins in the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe, a body of 200 men and women drawn from the national parliaments of Europe and from the governments of the member states that did its work in public and listened to what the public had to say.  It finds its legitimacy in the fact that it was uniquely constructed in a way that involved the people chosen by the voters of Europe to represent their interests.</P>
        <P>A second and equally important point is that this is a balanced treaty that represents a particularly good deal for the small and medium-sized member states.  The latter point should be bourne in mind by those who mindlessly sloganise about voting &ldquo;no&rdquo; to get a better &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. There is no chance, nor is there a need, for a better &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; this treaty is good for Europe and great for Ireland.</P>
         <P>I will outline what this treaty will do.  It will enhance the European Union&rsquo;s democratic character; increase the role of national parliaments and the European Parliament; reform decision-making within the Union; and make the Union better equipped to deal with the real issues that are important to the lives of all European citizens, including every person on this island, issues such as globalisation, energy security, climate change and a more challenging international economic environment.  The treaty will strengthen the voice of the European Union on the world stage; give effect to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights; set out the European Union&rsquo;s powers and limits more clearly than ever before; and give specific powers to the Union to help combat international and cross-border crime.</P>
        <P>The EU member states have invested years of work in producing this treaty.  It is vital to the European Union&rsquo;s future.  That fact is recognised by democratically elected governments, national parliaments and the vast majority of the members of the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>The forthcoming referendum once again puts Ireland in a pivotal position.  Without securing a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in Ireland, this treaty will fall and the Union will be cast into a further period of introspection.  That will damage the European Union but most importantly it will damage Ireland.  Important as the treaty is for the European Union, its emphatic ratification is vital for Ireland.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s place is at the heart of Europe.  We are a small nation that has carved a unique niche within the European Union.  Ireland is seen as a member state that is fully committed to the European project.  We are perceived as a  player.  We are viewed with goodwill.  We have influence way above our size and are seen to punch above our weight.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Since joining the European Union, as was stated last night, we have made remarkable strides.  Irish <i>per capita</i> GDP was 60% of the European average in 1973 but stood at 144% of the European average in 2007.  The Single Market has opened up trade opportunities for Irish-based companies.  Our exports to European Union member states increased from &euro;45 billion in 1997 to &euro;87 billion in 2006.  We have benefited hugely from European Union transfer payments.  Between 1973 and 2003 we received &euro;58 billion in CAP, Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds from the Union.  Membership of the European monetary union and the euro zone in a sense saw Ireland come of age.</P>
        <P>The euro has eliminated exchange rate uncertainty for business and tourism and provided stability and protection in an otherwise volatile world.  By far and away our biggest achievement within Europe has been the creation of 1 million extra jobs since 1973.  Our workforce today at 2 million is twice what it was when we joined the Union.  Most importantly, because Ireland is seen to be fully committed to Europe, we have been immensely successful in attracting foreign direct investment from right across the world.  One recent study published in Brussels <Col N="37"/>described Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to attract US foreign direct investment as &ldquo;simply stunning&rdquo;.  The same report made the point that as at the end of 2006 Ireland had attracted $83 billion US investment more than China, Russia, India and Brazil, which, combined, attracted $73 billion.  Jobs flow from investment.</P>
        <P>Because of the clear benefits of European Union membership, even those who initially opposed Ireland&rsquo;s joining the European Union must accept that our place is in Europe.  We now have the bizarre situation where Sinn F&eacute;in, having fought tooth and nail against Ireland joining Europe and having urged a rejection and a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in every treaty, now proclaims itself to be committed to Europe, while again urging a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote.  That is an example of it trying to have it both ways.</P>
        <P>If we were by any chance to reject this treaty, Ireland would not only create a major reversal for Europe but we would damage our reputation, we would squander the goodwill we have painstakingly built up as a nation over the years in Europe and by creating uncertainty we would send what IBEC has called &ldquo;a worrying signal. . . into the board rooms&rdquo; where decisions on foreign direct investment are made.</P>
        <P>This is a good treaty.  It aims to make Europe more democratic and more effective; to give us a better voice on the world stage; to enhance the rights of European citizens; to better define the limits within which the European Union operates; and to provide the Union with the capacity to deal with major challenges.  I will deal with each of those issues.  This more than any other treaty will improve the democratic character of the European Union.  The European Parliament will have its powers dramatically increased, in terms of dramatic improvements in law-making and increased budgetary powers.  It provides that the Parliament will directly elect the European Commission President.  It will enhance the Parliament&rsquo;s role in any future treaty negotiations.</P>
        <P>The big winners in this treaty will be national parliaments.  They will be given a dramatically extended role.  They will receive draft EU law at the same time as national governments; have a longer time to scrutinise draft EU law; be able to object to a draft proposal on the grounds that it breaches the principle of subsidiarity &mdash; the national parliaments are made the guardians of subsidiarity in this treaty; and have the right to veto any proposal to change an issue from unanimous voting to qualified majority voting.</P>
        <P>The treaty contains a unique new initiative.  It will enhance participatory democracy.  A petition signed by 1 million citizens collected from a significant number of member states requesting the Commission to take a specific initiative must be addressed by the Commission.</P>
        <P>A central aim of the treaty is to make the Union more efficient, more effective and better equipped to meet the challenges in the years ahead.  It provides that there will be a new full-time President of the European Council who can be elected for a maximum of two renewable terms of two and a half years.  The President&rsquo;s role will be to co-ordinate the work of the Council.  The Council will become a fully-fledged institution.  This new office will be more of chairman than chief; it will certainly not be that of a president of Europe to be feared by any citizen.</P>
        <P>In the future, the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, which currently rotates every six months between the member states, will be provided by a team of three member states working together over an 18-month period.  This is hardly a dramatic step forward.  This will share the burden of the Presidency, ensure continuity and help to integrate thinking in the Union.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case our partners will be Greece and Lithuania.  They could hardly be more advantageous.  Our partners will be two other small states, neither of which has a lead role on temperate agriculture.  This will be clearly to our advantage.</P><Col N="38"/>
        <P>A new voting system will be used in the Council of Ministers.  Under the new arrangements a qualified majority vote will require 55% of the member states and 65% of the Union&rsquo;s population.  At present, Ireland has seven votes out of 345.  The new voting system was selected because it is simpler, more efficient and easier to understand than the complex system of voting introduced in the Nice treaty.  Under the new system, at least 15 member states representing almost two thirds of the Union&rsquo;s population must support a measure before it is carried.  In other words, it is based on consensus.  Another dramatic effect of the new voting process is that it reflects the dual nature of the EU, which is a union both of equal states and equal citizens.</P>
        <P>To prevent the European Commission becoming too large and unwieldy, its size will be capped at two thirds of the number of member states from 2014.  This is not a new idea.  As Deputy Timmins observed yesterday, it was envisaged in the Nice treaty, which was endorsed by the voters.  Under the new arrangements, the right to nominate a Commissioner will rotate on a strictly equal basis between the member states, large and small.  When Ireland joined the EU, the large member states nominated two Commissioners while the smaller member states could nominate only one.  Again, the principle of equality underlines this proposition.</P>
        <P>Membership of the European Parliament has been capped at 751.  Concern has been expressed that the Parliament was growing too large to be effective.  The treaty provides that no member state shall have less than six or more than 96 MEPs.  As envisaged under the Nice treaty, Ireland will have 12 MEPs.  The new arrangement means that the smaller countries have proportionately more MEPs <i>per capita</i> than the larger states.</P>
        <P>The EU institutions were designed for a community of six member states.  The arrangements have operated for 50 years without fundamental reform.  No business enterprise of any scale or importance would expect, 50 years after its foundation, to be operating on the same organisational basis that was put in place on the day of its foundation.  The changes proposed in the treaty are not great but they will make Europe more effective for business and for its citizens.</P>
        <P>A new post of high representative for foreign affairs and security policy will bring together two existing posts.  These arrangements aim to enhance the co-ordination of EU activity in respect of third countries and generally improve the EU&rsquo;s visibility in external relations.  The high representative will not replace national Ministers for Foreign Affairs or the national foreign services.</P>
        <P>The treaty also provides for the better protection of the rights of EU citizens and raises those rights to an entirely new level.  For those of us who have read it, perhaps the most admirable aspect of the treaty is the provision whereby the Charter of Fundamental Rights is made legally binding on the Union&rsquo;s institutions and on member states when implementing EU law.  The charter sets out the rights enjoyed by the EU&rsquo;s citizens.  These include the right to life, the prohibition of torture, respect for private and family life, the right to an effective remedy, the right to a fair trial, citizens&rsquo; rights, such as the right to vote and stand as a candidate at elections to the European Parliament, and workers&rsquo; rights, such as the right to information and consultation, protection in the event of unjustified dismissal, fair and just working conditions, and the protection of young people at work.  Why would anybody object to that?</P>
        <P>The charter draws its inspiration from the EU treaties, from international human rights law and from the constitutions of the member states.  The values on which the European Union is founded &mdash; respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities &mdash; are spelled out more clearly than ever before in this treaty.  Yet, a minority of Members of this House are calling for its rejection.</P><Col N="39"/>
        <P>The treaty provides a more precise outline of the powers conferred on the Union by the member states.  It makes clear that the EU has only those powers explicitly conferred on it &mdash; the principle of conferral.  The subsidiarity principle provides that the EU shall only act if and only in so far as the objective in question cannot be sufficiently achieved at member state level.  Under the principle of proportionality, the Union shall only act to the extent necessary to achieve the objective in question.</P>
        <P>The balance of responsibility between the Union and the member states remains more or less as it is in most areas.  However, there have been some grossly exaggerated comments regarding the number of areas that will move from unanimous voting to qualified majority voting.  The most sensitive areas, including taxation, defence matters, common foreign and security policy, social security, citizens&rsquo; rights, official languages and the seats of EU institutions, will continue to require unanimous agreement into the future.</P>
        <P>Every EU treaty that has been put to the Irish people by way of referendum has become the subject of myths, distortions and untruthful efforts to confuse and mislead either by those, such as Sinn F&eacute;in, who have traditionally opposed Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the European project or by the <i>ad hoc</i> opponents that spring up around each referendum.  This treaty has given rise to a bumper crop of myths.  These myths are propagated by an intriguing collection of opponents, the bulk of whom have no democratic mandate and none of whom has any record of delivery for this country.  We have had claims that this is a self-amending treaty.  More specifically, there have been claims about the loss of our neutrality, massive transfers of competences and powers, loss of influence through the new voting system, a reduction of our ability to prevent decisions that are not in Ireland&rsquo;s interests and the loss of an Irish Commissioner.  Each of these myths is easily dismissed.</P>
        <P>The self-amending treaty myth is precisely that, a myth.  The treaty makes clear that any future treaty amendments &ldquo;shall enter into force after being ratified by all member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements&rdquo;.  In Ireland, this means that any change of any significance at any future time will require a referendum.</P>
        <P>The most enduring myth is that ratification will erode Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently peddled this myth for 35 years.  In 1972, for example, campaigning against our entry into the EEC, Sinn F&eacute;in opposed accession on the grounds that the objective was &ldquo;a united states of Europe with a European army&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Irish people&rdquo;, we were warned, would be &ldquo;compelled to fight wars the European powers decide to wage&rdquo;.  Our neutrality would be forsaken and compulsory military service for young people would be introduced.  Opposing the Single European Act in 1987, Sinn F&eacute;in claimed it would &ldquo;surrender power completely to the NATO-dominated EEC&rdquo;.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s opposition to the Maastricht treaty in 1992 was based on its prediction that it represented a &ldquo;death knell for Irish neutrality&rdquo;.  In 1998, Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the Amsterdam treaty with the argument that it represented &ldquo;the most significant step towards a military common defence in Europe&rdquo; and would &ldquo;ensure that the nuclear-armed Western European Union&rdquo; was integrated into the European Union structures.  Opposing the Nice treaty in 2001, the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Mr. Gerry Adams, who has been curiously absent from the current debate, said that the treaty  would &ldquo;bring us closer into a European army and into NATO&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The truth is that our Constitution prohibits participation in any common defence.  It is a pity that Sinn F&eacute;in, having reluctantly and only recently recognised Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireannn, would not take the time to read it.  The second referendum on the Nice treaty provided that Ireland may not accede to any common EU defence arrangement without the specific consent of the people in a referendum.  This is part of our Constitution and will not change.  Arguments that Ireland can somehow be involved in a common defence are without foundation.</P><Col N="40"/>
        <P>The focus of EU policy is not warmongering but peacekeeping, crisis management and humanitarian tasks that are entirely consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s values and best traditions.  The treaty does not require member states to increase military capacity.  Some of its opponents would have us believe that the EU is about to undertake military adventures.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The types of operations in which the EU is involved are based on peacekeeping efforts.  In Aceh Province, for example, a monitoring mission was established to help build peace in a troubled region.  The EU mission to the Western Balkans has stabilised an area that saw grotesque human rights abuses in the last decade.  The humanitarian and peacekeeping operation in Chad, meanwhile, was requested by the United Nations.</P>
        <P>The move to majority voting is another of those areas that has attracted an encrustation of myths.  Not to be outdone by anybody in making false claims against the treaty, Sinn F&eacute;in charges that it provides 105 new competences to the EU and that a further 68 areas will move to majority voting.   The reality is different.  The treaty provides for 22 existing areas to be transferred to qualified majority voting.  None of the changes is earth-shattering.  The list was published in a recent parliamentary reply to Deputy Timmins.  More than one third of the areas will apply to Ireland only if we opt in on a case-by-case basis.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been asked repeatedly to publish its list of 173 changes but refuses to do so.</P>
        <P>Another myth is that the new voting system halves Ireland&rsquo;s voting strength.  Under the new procedures, as already mentioned, a proposal requires support from 55% of the member states, representing not less than 65% of the population of the EU, to be enacted.  Sinn F&eacute;in and its fellow travellers in Libertas take into account only one element of the voting mechanism &mdash; population &mdash; in their criticism.  This is like discarding the points scored in deciding who has won a hurling match.</P>
        <P>The claim has been made that we will lose control over key decisions.  This is also false.  All of Ireland&rsquo;s key interests are protected.  Taxation, defence and foreign policy will continue to require unanimous voting.  Member states can veto any proposal by withholding support.  We are retaining our protocol on abortion.  The treaty does not give rise to any new barriers on Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to attract foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>Much is being made of the supposed loss of an Irish Commissioner.  The members of the Commission have no national representative role &mdash; they give an undertaking to represent the interests of the EU only.  Therefore, critics are telling just half the story in this instance.  They omit to mention that this deal was struck in the Nice treaty, which the Irish people have already endorsed.  I accept that the Commission will be smaller and more focused from 2014, but that is a good thing.  Every member state will be treated equally when the Commission is being formed.  The rotation system will be applied on the basis of strict equality.  Under this treaty, all appointments to the Commission will be made on the basis of equal rotation among the member states.  This is a demonstration of the equality of all member states.  The myth that makes my cat laugh is that Sinn F&eacute;in is somehow pro-Europe.  As I have already said, Sinn F&eacute;in has called for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in every Irish referendum to date.</P>
        <P>A huge amount depends on our decision, which will have an impact far beyond our shores.  It will affect the lives of almost half a billion people across all 27 member states.  The idea that we can &ldquo;Vote No for a better Yes&rdquo;, which is a vacuous slogan, is a dangerous delusion, as is any suggestion that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote is cost-free.  A &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote comes with a massive price tag.  It would be seen in Europe as a rejection, serving no purpose, of almost a decade&rsquo;s work by the member states.  If Ireland were to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, we would not be kicked out of the European Union.  The EU will not come to a halt in such circumstances &mdash; it will struggle on.  The danger, however, is that a balanced treaty which gives huge benefits to small and medium sized states, <Col N="41"/>will be lost.  If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, we will squander the goodwill we have painstakingly built up since we joined the EEC 35 years ago.  We will damage Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as the &ldquo;can do&rdquo; member state &mdash; the small country that gets things done.  We will undoubtedly send what IBEC has called &ldquo;a worrying signal&rdquo; into the board rooms in which decisions on foreign direct investment are made and will continue to be made.  That would have a dire economic effect on this country.</P>
        <P>A further real danger, which has not been discussed very often, was identified in a recent series of perceptive articles in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I refer to the possibility, in the event of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote here, that larger member states will conclude that after ten years of trying to reform the EU, their efforts have produced no results.  In such circumstances, stasis will stare the Union in the face.  If such countries become frustrated, they may decide to fall back on bilateral arrangements.  This would produce the two-speed Europe that small and medium sized member states fought long and hard to prevent when the Convention on the Future of Europe was being drawn up.  One of the underlying themes within the convention was the need to create a Europe that is based on equality.  Another concern that ran through the debate was the idea that a two-speed Europe might develop.  Such an approach would destroy the &ldquo;community method&rdquo; and ultimately undermine the Union itself.  The European project is underpinned by the essential principle that member states are seen to be equals and act as equals.  To undermine that principle would have a high cost.</P>
        <P>I believe this country will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for a variety of positive reasons.  Not only do we want to avoid the pitfalls associated with a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, but we also want to show that we have a positive view of the EU.  The Irish people will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; because they value the peace the EU has fashioned on a continent that has frequently torn itself asunder with conflict.  We recognise the generous role played by the EU in fashioning peace on this island.  We will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; because we value a more democratic EU that stands for the ideals and values we espouse.  The Irish people are practical enough to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; as a means of recognising that the best way to deal with major problems like globalisation, energy security, criminality and climate change is to pool our resources as we have done in the past.  Above all, I believe Ireland will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; because the vast majority of Irish people can see and are convinced that our development, our place as a nation and our future economic well-being are best served by keeping Ireland at the heart of the European Union.</P>
        <P>Deputy Costello asked last night about the wording of the proposal to be put to the people on polling day.  In essence, the people will decide on 12 June whether the wording contained in the Schedule to this Bill is to be included in the Constitution.  I believe the answer to that question can, should and will be &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Ireland has found its feet in Europe.  Our future is in Europe.  The best way to ensure that our future is good and positive is to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and making a logical and informative speech.  It can be difficult to get the message across, at local, national and European level, during referendum campaigns.  I suppose that is the challenge we all face over the coming weeks.  We will have to get the message across by transmitting the relevant facts without being seen to dictate to people.  We will have to ensure there is an informed debate.  I always welcome the opportunity to hear both sides of any debate.  There is a great deal of information out there.</P>
        <P>We have been through quite a turbulent time.  There was a general election less than a year ago.  Governments have fallen across Europe.  The Taoiseach announced his retirement yesterday.  It is now time to focus on the EU reform treaty.  It is nice to see that people are uniting to get the facts across.  I do not detract from those who oppose the treaty when I say that those of us who support it need to transmit the correct facts.</P><Col N="42"/>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty was signed in the Portuguese capital by the leaders of the 27 EU member states in December 2007.  The Government has been asked to ratify the treaty in 2008 with a view to bringing it into force in 2009.  I will comment on some of the issues which arise from it.  A politician will be chosen to serve as President of the European Council for two and a half years.  That new structure will replace the current system whereby countries take turns in the Presidency role for six months.  The existing system was all very well when there were just 12 member states.  We were proud to excel ourselves when Ireland held the EU Presidency a few years ago.  The current structure needs to be addressed, however, as it has become a little topsy-turvy since the Union expanded to 27 member states.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that a new post, combining the jobs currently held by the existing foreign affairs supremo, Javier Solana, and the existing Commissioner for External Affairs and European Neighbourhood Policy, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, will give the EU more clout on the world stage.  Such a position is needed in the context of the EU&rsquo;s dealings with major economic blocs like the United States and China, which is starting to come into consideration.  I have always said that the US made huge sacrifices to bring a certain level of stability to the continent of Europe in tougher times, certainly during the First World War and the Second World War.  However, a counterbalance to the US is needed.  Just as President Bush is able to speak on behalf of a continent, there should be an individual who can speak on behalf of the European continent.  While I do not suggest that the person in question should act as a dictator, it is important that one voice is heard.  This development is to be welcomed.  Restrictions are in place to ensure we will not have a dictator.</P>
        <P>The treaty will establish a smaller EU Commission, with a smaller number of Commissioners than the number of member states, from 2014.  There will be a redistribution of voting weights among the member states between 2014 and 2017.  These aspects of the treaty represent a logical response to the expansion of the European Union.  They are designed to ensure that the 27 member states work together more effectively.  Ireland was to the forefront in supporting the enlargement process earlier in this decade, which has transformed the country.  It has transformed the countries of eastern and central Europe and brought enormous benefits to established member states and the EU as a whole.  The enlargements have fundamentally altered the shape, nature and direction of the European Union and reforms are certainly needed.</P>
        <P>When we joined the EEC in the early 1970s, it could be argued that Ireland might have done better between achieving its independence in 1922 and that time.  Our nearest neighbour, Britain, was fair to this country, but we were too dependent on the UK bloc.  Any downturn in that economy was felt in Ireland.  Many of us had parents, brothers, sisters and even grandparents who emigrated to the UK and indeed the United States.  Membership of the EU has helped Ireland become a competent, vibrant nation and we can move on from there.  We have been a beneficiary of European funds since accession to the EEC in 1973 to the tune of some &euro;60 billion.  Because of the Structural Funds investment one can leave Dublin now and be in the west of Ireland in under two hours.  This would have been unheard of 15 years ago, certainly with the volumes of traffic we have.  Ireland is a place in which to do business and the open market economy has helped.  Completion of the Single Market has placed the emphasis on competitiveness, with the prospect of greater economic security for all.  Certainly in these difficult times, economic security is a very good reason for seeking a stronger economic Union.</P>
        <P>I am aware the reform treaty will allow Ireland to continue with its well-established tradition of military neutrality.  We should be able to build on the work of our Defence Forces, as regards international peacekeeping.  I was very proud during the Easter parade, 18 months ago, to see the great capacity of the Defence Forces on display for peacekeeping.  It highlighted for most politicians present the great resource Ireland has in its Defence Forces.  The constitutional <Col N="43"/>prohibition on Ireland joining an EU common defence force remains in place and a triple lock means that no Irish troops may be deployed without Irish and UN approval, which is vital.</P>
        <P>I read an article in <i>The Economist</i> recently which indicated another bloc is now on the horizon, namely, China.  Within the last three weeks I have been approached by five different agencies as regards funding for various charitable works in Africa &mdash; housebuilding in South Africa, schools in Chad or whatever.  Such initiatives are worthwhile and serve to illustrate Irish generosity.  Europe should assist Africa in the development and utilisation of its resources.  The United States has lost the concept of charity.  It has gone into Iraq, I accept, but the &euro;1 billion it spends every three days on that war could have meant an end to poverty in Africa if it had been spent there instead over the last five years.  That point  was made to me by an aid worker who is based in Africa.  Money on its own will not solve the problem, but together with goodwill and a strong European Union, it will certainly help the situation inordinately.  Europe colonised Africa and we plundered most of that continent&rsquo;s resources.  It is now time that a strong Europe tries to help amend the harm that has been done there.  There are huge opportunities and a stronger Europe can help sort out the situation in Africa.</P>
        <P>Also, there is a new China, <i>The Economist</i> argues, which is putting serious money into infrastructure.  China may seek to exploit African mineral resources.  I have some knowledge of the mining industry and believe that China is investing in every small mining company around the world.  It needs energy.  Europe should be at the forefront, however, not in exploiting that continent&rsquo;s mineral resources but rather in working with the African nations.  The Fair Trade coffee model might be employed, for instance, to enable Europe to work with these nations as partners to try to ensure they get the best possible return from their mineral resources.</P>
        <P>The reform treaty will, I believe, improve Ireland&rsquo;s ability to attract foreign direct investment and increase access for Irish business to international markets.  We have a growing vibrant economy and many Irish people have purchased property in Europe and are investing where they see opportunities.  Some very good opportunities are to be found and indeed there are bad opportunities on offer, too, as I know from personal experience.  I was one of those who bought property in Bansko.  However, there are great opportunities for a resurgent Irish economy within Europe.  That can only be helped by liberalising markets and ensuring more business opportunities.  There is a young vibrant market there that we can tap into.</P>
        <P>The Council of Ministers new voting system will make decision making more efficient and provide a greater role for national parliaments as regards how the Union works.  It will mean we will be much more accountable to Europe and that is to be welcomed.  Also, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be given binding legal status.  Europe has edged Ireland towards a much better form of democracy.  There are problems and people can say all that is being done is making green bananas yellow or whatever.  However, membership of the EU has made a fundamental difference to this country and that is to be welcomed.  If the treaty is passed it should come into force in 2009.  However, its different parts will come into effect at various times.  I urge the Irish people to examine the questions and perhaps look at the answers we are able to give.  We have had a positive 35 years within Europe, we have much to offer and I am very willing to support the treaty.  Ireland and the United Kingdom can opt out of EU policies on asylum, visas and immigration.  Under the new treaty, they will have the right to opt for or against any policies in the entire field of justice and home affairs.  This is welcome.  Poland is due to sign up to the guarantees and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The treaty is cumbersome but comprises an effort to involve every country and make every country happy therewith.</P><Col N="44"/>
        <P>Ireland is the only country committed to holding a referendum, which is to take place in June.  The Irish voters rejected the Nice treaty in 2001 &mdash; I will not use the term &ldquo;setback&rdquo; in this regard.  As politicians we did not get the message across and were very ambivalent about it.  We must not tell people how to vote but give them the facts.  The Irish electorate is quite sophisticated and I hope it will take on board our contribution.</P>
        <P>It is claimed that Ireland will lose an EU Commissioner but making such a claim is to misunderstand the nature of the Commission and its relationship to the Parliament and Council of the European Union.  There is no such being as an Irish Commissioner although there is a Commissioner from Ireland.  It is too tribal to state the former.  The 166 seats in the D&aacute;il do not belong to individual Members, such as myself or the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, but to the people of Ireland; this is what democracy is about.</P>
        <P>I am glad I had the chance to speak on the reform treaty.  The bottom line is that it is good for the European Union, including Ireland.  It certainly gives the European Union structures that can make it efficient in the 21st century.  Business and life evolve and in this regard the treaty builds on what we have achieved over 35 years.  It can make the Union better for all.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to participate in this very important debate on the future of Europe, and more particularly the future of the entire island of Ireland.  The treaty is designed to ensure that the European Union will become more efficient and effective in carrying out its business and making decisions.  Any good company, after 50 years in existence, will always update its organisational structures and the European Union is no different.</P>
        <P>Since 1973 the Union has enlarged.  It emerged first and foremost from the European Coal and Steel Community and then from the European Economic Community.  In 1957, when the founding fathers established the European Economic Community, it did not comprise six large countries but three large countries and three small ones.  These were the large countries of Italy, France, Germany and the small Benelux countries of Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland.  The interests of the three small ones have always been protected, as have the interests of our own small country.</P>
        <P>Key changes will be effected by the reform treaty.  One welcome development will be the appointment of a President of the European Council.  The President will co-ordinate the work of the EU leaders at European level.  He or she will not have any power as the power will rest with the Council.  A new High Representative will have responsibility for foreign affairs and security policy and will only be able to act with the agreement of the 27 member states of the Union.</P>
        <P>The Council, representing the Governments of the Union, and the European Parliament, will have just 33 new powers and not over 100, as some are suggesting.  These powers, by and large, will pertain to justice and home affairs issues.  They will help the Union to tackle issues such as illicit drug trafficking into Europe.  All of the 33 new powers will not necessarily pertain to Ireland because of our opt-out clause in respect of justice and home affairs.</P>
        <P>National parliaments will be consulted on all new EU legislative proposals.  This is a very welcome development and it will afford Members of the Oireachtas greater input into the development of the Union.</P>
        <P>The treaty is to ensure that the Union will become more structured.  It sets out how it will deal with the new political challenges, be it climate change, the protection of energy supplies or the tackling of illegal immigration.  There is nothing hidden in the treaty.  A more effective and efficient Union will further the development of the European economy, including that of <Col N="45"/>Ireland.  This in turn will help to implement the Lisbon strategy, which is designed to ensure the Union will become the most competitive body in the world by 2010.  It is in our own best interest politically and economically to vote in favour of the treaty.</P>
        <P>As an island economy, we have depended on and will depend on inward investment.  One of our key selling points in attracting industry is that Ireland is at the heart of the European Union, punching above its weight, at the same time as being on the periphery.  We attract companies that use Ireland as a gateway to the EU market of 500 million people.  Locating here offers free access to a market for goods and services.  I refer not only to inward investment but also to indigenous industry.</P>
        <P>Companies from around the world want Ireland to be active and a leading and central member of the European Union.  A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will ensure this.  A &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would send out the wrong message and investors globally would take the view that Ireland is moving away from the European project and establishing a more distant relationship with the Union.</P>
        <P>There is no valid economic argument to vote against the treaty.  When we joined the Union in 1973, the value of foreign direct investment was the equivalent of &euro;16 million.  In 2006 alone, we exported goods and services valued at over &euro;56 billion to the other 26 member states without having to pay any tariffs.  In 2007, 136,000 IDA Ireland jobs generated over &euro;3 billion in corporation tax, helping our major spending programmes.  It was suggested time and again that the higher the taxes, the more income we would have, but of course the opposite is the fact.  We in this country have seen that the policy of lowering taxes, whether income tax, corporation tax or whatever, adopted by the Government over the past ten or 11 years has led to greater income to finance our various ambitious, yet realistic, plans.</P>
        <P>When we joined the European Union in 1973 there were only 1 million people employed in this country.  Now there are 2 million people employed in Ireland.  Had we not joined the European Union, had we not played an integral part in the European Union, I venture to suggest that we would be well off that 2 million jobs mark.</P>
        <P>Regardless of the part of the country from which we come, we all have witnessed the benefits of the single European currency, for consumers and businesses alike, with the elimination of the exchange rate risk.  When I went to the European Parliament in 1974 to represent the constituency of Connacht-Ulster we had to carry various currencies with us.  If I went through Northern Ireland, I needed sterling.  Depending on where I was going, I needed currencies for Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, whereas the introduction of the euro eliminated all those currencies in the best interests of the citizen and, more particularly, in the best interests of the economy of Europe.</P>
        <P>It is only because we embraced globalisation that we achieved success.  Today the most objective observers, even those who might be critical, would agree that we have a successful country, a strong economy, low unemployment, sound public finances and a major programme of investment.  Of course we face challenges, but we have faced challenges in the past and we will face challenges in the future, and I believe we will overcome them.</P>
        <P>The European Union is a cause for peace in Europe and, indeed, here on our island.  When the founding fathers met in the early 1950s they took the view that Europe had been ravaged by wars dating back to the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the First World War from 1914 to 1918 and the Second World War from 1939 to 1945.  They took the view that they did not want successive generations of Europeans to experience this and arch enemies sat down and decided that they would strive to unite Europe.  We are well on the way to achieving their objective to have a peaceful Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals.</P>
        <P>Speaking of the importance of the peace process, the European Union has played a key role in helping the peace process in Ireland.  The Single European Act removed the economic border <Col N="46"/>in this country and that was one of the major steps in the overall peace process.  The European Union has contributed &euro;1.6 billion in support of the peace process in this country since 1985.</P>
        <P>I remember well being in Europe when the cessation of violence was announced here.  Jacques Delors, then President of the European Commission, stated that Europe would respond in a positive and pragmatic way, and he and Europe did that.  The only vehicle that was available at that time was the International Fund for Ireland and, with unanimous approval from the European Parliament, Europe&rsquo;s contribution towards the International Fund for Ireland was immediately increased.  That fund has created thousands of jobs with hundreds of projects on both sides of the Border.</P>
        <P>Through the years of violence and division, European leaders and the institutions played a key role, sometimes behind the scenes, in encouraging a move towards peace and a shared future based on equality and fairness.  The public face of the European Union in Northern Ireland and in the Border counties has been the EU peace programme.  I was privileged to be a member of the European Parliament at that time representing the Border counties, when we had unanimous approval for funding towards the European Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, with 75% of those funds coming from the European Union and the other 25% coming from both Governments.</P>
        <P>As one who comes from a Border county which has suffered economically, possibly more than any other county&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;being geographically North and politically South, with the Atlantic Ocean on one side, Northern Ireland on the other and a border of seven or eight kilometres with the South, I remember in those days it was very difficult to attract tourists and industry.  I remember when Senator George Mitchell played such an important role in the peace process a business conference was held in Washington and I did an exercise on inward investment which showed that very few American companies were located in the Border counties and Northern Ireland.  I believe that will now change because of the peace process and the stability in this country, and I wish well the business conference that will take place in Belfast in early May of this year.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the European Union has played an important role in the International Fund for Ireland set up under the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the mid-1980s.  Through that fund, the Union has promoted economic growth on the island.  It has encouraged contact, dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland and on both sides of the Border, and has gone a long way to achieving the objectives set out by those responsible for the International Fund for Ireland and of course the European Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that prior to the European Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, we in the Border counties received INTERREG and the mainstream funds such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the European Social Fund, but the then Members of the European Parliament such as myself, Joe McCartan, Mark Killilea and, in the North, Ian Paisley, John Hume and Jim Nicholson made clear at that time that we wanted this to be additional, and it was.  Too often new funds substitute for others, but this did not happen and that made a real impact.</P>
        <P>In addition, funding has been provided through the European Regional Development Fund for general cross-Border co-operation projects between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland under the INTERREG programme.  Total INTERREG funding for Northern Ireland <Col N="47"/>and the Republic of Ireland from 2000 to 2006 was &euro;182 million.  As the House will be aware, INTERREG has been mainstreamed for the period 2007 to 2013 under the financial perspective which will be known as territorial co-operation.</P>
        <P>I realise from the debate that has just started throughout the country that there will be scaremongering during the course of the referendum campaign.  We will be told that a vote for the treaty is a vote for Peter Mandelson and an end to the Common Agricultural Policy.  We will be told that by signing up to the treaty, Irish agriculture will run into difficulties.  These allegations are wrong and dishonest.  I appreciate there are concerns about the WTO and the attitude of Peter Mandelson, but he takes his brief from the General Affairs Council.  Our Ministers at the General Affairs Council and the Ministers in agriculture and trade will do their utmost to ensure the outcome of the WTO will be fair and balanced and that there will be no major detrimental consequence for Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>If we turn our back on the Union and vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, I do not believe we will be cut off from regional and cohesion funding.  However, if we do that, it will be extremely difficult for us to travel to Brussels and negotiate preferable treatment for Ireland in a Union of 27 with competing interests and demands.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the years we have punched above our weight and have been highly regarded in Europe.  I think, in particular, of the periods when we held the Presidency, in 1994-95 when Deputy Quinn was a Minister and more recently when we negotiated this treaty.  There is no major change in the treaty.  Why would the Government negotiate a treaty which would be anti-Ireland?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Much depends on our decision, which will have an impact far before our shores.  If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that decision will have a detrimental impact for future generations and they will never thank us for it.  Our decision will have an impact on the lives of approximately 0.5 billion people in the European Union.  We must ask ourselves, as we face into the referendum, whether we should listen to those elected by the people of Europe to speak on our behalf, to people with a track record, to leaders who have made a positive contribution or to other voices or people who, although probably sincere, have been wrong in all their predictions about Europe.  In every referendum since 1973, Sinn F&eacute;in has told us we were taking the wrong decision.  It has said the same this time.  I believe the Irish people will prove them wrong.</P>
        <P>Let us vote in the referendum on the basis of the treaty and not on any other basis.  People may have local or national grievances, but this is not the time to express their views by voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  This is the opportunity to vote for the future of the country and to vote for future generations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2008 on the Lisbon reform treaty.  I am delighted also that the Taoiseach named the date for the referendum, Thursday, 12 June 2008.  This gives all parties the opportunity over the next few months to go to the people and explain the treaty to them.  The people need to have it explained.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael Party supports the Bill and we will encourage a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote over the next few months.  As a party, Fine Gael has taken its responsibility seriously and will take the campaign to the people.  We have already commenced this with meetings in Sligo and Cork.  We had a large attendance at those meetings and found the meetings constructive.  We had expert speakers who explained the treaty to the audience.</P><Col N="48"/>
        <P>We will have approximately 30 meetings throughout the country at various venues.  The meeting in my Clare constituency will be on 6 May, next Tuesday.  Our party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, who is a committed European, will attend many of these meetings.  I am delighted he has invited the European People&rsquo;s Party, EPP, group to Ireland and it will attend a summit meeting in the Shelbourne Hotel on Monday, 14 April 2008.  We expect there will be a number of European leaders at that summit meeting, including the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel.  Some 11 heads of Government are members of the EPP group.  It is the largest group in Europe and is a very committed group.</P>
        <P>The meeting will have nothing to do with the reform treaty as it is an extraordinary meeting to deal with other European affairs.  It is a matter for the Irish people to deal with the referendum themselves.  However, I am sure party leaders who will attend the summit will have a keen interest in the Irish situation.  As many previous speakers have said, Ireland is the only country out of the 27 European Union members that will put the treaty to the people in a referendum.  All eyes will be on the Irish over the next few months to see whether they will ratify the treaty.</P>
        <P>I am confident the treaty will be ratified.  We have an educated electorate and they will realise that Europe has been good to them and that by ratifying the treaty, Ireland will play its role.  I congratulate the Polish Government on its ratification of the treaty this week in Warsaw.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It did so by an overwhelming majority of 80% to 20%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and it is a country that has just joined the European Union.  It is the seventh country to have ratified the treaty.  We already had Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Malta, Slovenia and recently France, at an elaborate ceremony in Versailles.</P>
        <P>What are we asking the people to vote for in June?  Many of the people do not know the provisions of the Lisbon treaty or for what they are voting.  The outcome of our vote in June will affect the lives of almost 500 million people in Europe.  We all remember what happened with the Nice treaty.  It was rejected and not ratified at first, and much of the blame for that goes to the political parties who did not do their job.  We ratified it second time round, but what would have happened if we did not?  Our ratification gave countries like Poland and other post-communist east European countries an opportunity for a better life.  Now we have many of these people working throughout Europe and in Ireland and playing an important role in building our infrastructure and providing for our future needs.</P>
        <P>Referenda are complex, but not very exciting.  The Lisbon treaty is no different in that respect from previous treaties and must be explained in simple terms to the electorate.  Since the formation of the EEC in 1957 when there were six members, the EU has changed significantly.  We joined in 1973 with Denmark and the UK.  EU membership has been good for Ireland and since joining we have created approximately 1 million jobs and received almost &euro;58 billion in transfer payments.  That amounts to approximately &euro;15,000 for every man, woman and child in the country.  Irish citizens have the right to move, work and reside freely in other member states.  Many of our young people are doing that and <i>vice versa</i>.  Many people from Poland and other post-communist countries are moving to this country and playing their very important role here.  Of course, the introduction of the euro has made travel within the EU more convenient and much more effective.</P>
        <P>A total of 960 foreign companies employing 960,000 workers have set up in Ireland.  We also enjoy free health cover when we travel to other countries.  Irish is now an official language in the EU.  Average wages have increased from 60% of the EU average in 1973 to 138% today.  Over that period, we have built nearly 500 km of motorway.  We have come a long way.  I <Col N="49"/>would certainly like to see more motorways built throughout the country but it will happen.  Europe has played a very important role in building those motorways through finance from the European Structural Funds.</P>
        <P>These are just some of the benefits of our EU membership.  There have been many treaties over the past 50 years since the formation of the EEC.  These treaties are designed to improve the Union.  In 1986, we voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in a referendum on the Single European Act, which established a single market and improved our competitiveness.  Look at the international markets that have opened up to us.  In 1992, we voted for the Maastricht treaty, which paved the way for monetary union.  In 1997, we voted for the Amsterdam treaty, which added to the previous treaties.  In 2001, we voted for the Nice treaty, which dealt with the enlargement of the union to cater for the 25 new members at that time.  Since then, two more countries have been added to the Union.</P>
        <P>These treaties are necessary to cater for expansion in the way the EU operates.  It is quite obvious that since 27 countries are now members of the EU, it is much harder to operate than it was back in 1973 when we joined and there were only nine countries in the Union.  Therefore, these changes have to be made from time to time in order to enhance efficiency and the way democracy works in the Union.</P>
        <P>The main provisions of the Lisbon treaty, as explained by the Minister last night and Deputy Timmins, will provide national parliaments, including the D&aacute;il, with a new wider role in EU affairs.  It will develop the role of the European Parliament and introduce a citizens&rsquo; initiative which gives EU citizens a direct role in EU matters.  Under this rule, a person with one million signatures from a number of member states can request the European Commission to bring forward proposals for new laws.  It will reform the decision-making process within the Union and will set out the EU&rsquo;s powers and their limits.  The EU reaffirms its commitment to consensus in decision making and respects the rights of smaller member states.  That is the key in this treaty and the EU itself.  Under the new proposed voting rules in the Council of Ministers, a double lock will operate which requires proposals to get the support of a majority composed of 55% of EU member states representing at least 65% of the EU population.  In addition, even if all large member states voted the same way on a particular proposal, the support of at least nine small member states would be required.</P>
        <P>There has been concern for some time that the European Commission is becoming too large and difficult to operate.  There are 27 Commissioners and each country has a Commissioner.  Under the new treaty, the Commissioners will be limited to two-thirds of the number of member states.  If there are 27 members at the moment, we will have 18 Commissioners.  That would make it more like our Cabinet.  I know the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, knows that 15, 16 or 17 is more than enough people at a Cabinet table.  Where one has 27 members, it is much more difficult for decisions to be made and for consensus to be reached.  It is much more efficient and effective to have a Cabinet-type Commission.  It will be stronger and much more cohesive.  Membership of the Commission will be organised on a strict rotation basis.  Each member state will have a Commissioner for ten out of every 15 years.  Importantly, this will apply to the large countries as well as small ones.  Countries like Ireland and Luxembourg will be treated in the same way as the bigger countries.  We all know that in the past, Germany, Italy, France and Great Britain had two Commissioners, while we had only one.  All these countries will now be treated in the same way.  This demonstrates how small countries are being looked after by the EU and the treaty and that they are being protected.  The same can be said for the European Parliament where no country, no matter how small, can have fewer than six MEPs and where the larger countries can have no more than 96.  We have 13 MEPs, a number that will be reduced to 12 for the next European elections.</P><Col N="50"/>
        <P>The treaty also contains provisions on fundamental rights.  It gives legal status to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and allows EU ratification of the European Convention on Human Rights.  This is also very important in light of what is happening throughout the world in respect of human rights in areas like Zimbabwe, Tibet and Burma.  On the external role, a new permanent President of the European Council, who will be elected for two and a half years by the Heads of State and Government, will drive forward the EU and will report back to the European institutions.  A new high commissioner will ensure consistency in the EU&rsquo;s dealings with foreign countries and international bodies.  It is very important that we have someone like that to represent and have the backing of the 27 member states.</P>
        <P>For the ordinary person, the Lisbon treaty is not exciting.  Ordinary people do not see millions of euro coming to the country as a result of it.  However, it will improve efficiency and create better and more open procedures.  When one has 27 countries, one has different styles of government, economies, cultures and aspirations.  One must have a new treaty to deal with those challenges and that is what the Lisbon treaty is all about.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that those who oppose the treaty will come out with the same arguments they produced during other referenda debates in the past.  They will claim that the treaty will raise taxes, create a superstate, cost us money and lead to free availability of abortion and stem cell research.  The other argument is that we will be forced to join a European army.  These are just some of the arguments these people will come up with.  Of course, they have a right to oppose treaties.  That is what democracy is all about.  However, I firmly believe that their arguments must be valid, based on fact and relate to what is contained in the proposed treaty.  Their arguments must not be based on exaggerated and untrue claims that are intended to scare the electorate and create an atmosphere of fear.</P>

	<P>The treaty will not raise taxes because it contains no reference to a common tax policy.  Ireland will retain control of its own tax policy and tax rates.  The treaty does not create a superstate.  It safeguards our sovereignty and sets out the areas for which the EU has responsibility and its limits.  It will not lead to abortion and stem cell research.  The opposite is the case.  Health policy is a matter for each individual country.  We will not be forced to join a European army.  Our neutrality is fully protected.  European military activity is directed at peacekeeping and crisis intervention and participation is an option for any country.  We have heard this argument over the past 40 years and it is not true.  We must bring that debate to the people.  I have attended a number of meetings on the treaty and this is the story that comes up all the time.  I am asked whether we will have a super state and be conscripted into an army.  That debate must be brought forward by all the political parties.</P>
        <P>The treaty also gives a legal basis for combating climate change.  This is the first time this issue has been included in an EU treaty and it is most welcome considering what could happen to our environment over the next decade.  It is much easier for a European Union of 27 countries to deal with climate change on a broader basis than for one small individual country to deal with it.  I welcome that part of the treaty.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is present in the Chamber.  In the area of justice and home affairs, particularly combating international terrorism, drug and human trafficking, the reform treaty provides for majority voting in the fields of criminal law and police co-operation.  While there is scope for all people to cross borders freely, there is also scope for criminals to cross borders freely.  There must be police co-operation in all areas to prevent drug trafficking in the free movement area.</P><Col N="51"/>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, referred briefly to the farming community.  For the first time, the European Parliament as well as the Agriculture and Fisheries Council will have a say on agriculture issues.  Farmers will be able to lobby and influence their MEPs on matters of concern in agricultural policy.  These are just some of the facts in the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, which is chaired by Deputy Bernard Durkan.  Many groups have appeared before that committee in recent months, including the social partners and other groups with an interest in the treaty.  The committee has a role to play.  Next week we will meet some of the opponents and it will be interesting to hear what they have to say.  The social partners have a very important role to play in actively promoting the treaty, particularly those in favour.  Sometimes people do not have confidence in politicians which is why organisations like the IFA and IBEC have a very important role.  The Joint Committee on European Affairs will take the information campaign to the electorate and will visit five or six different venues in the next three months.  We will have speakers and will give information on the treaty.  We hope that those meetings will be well attended.  This is a good treaty that is ambitious, balanced and looks to the future.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak on this debate on the reform treaty.  It is an important development in Europe and there are compelling reasons for Ireland to support it.  My favourite definition of Europe has always been that of General de Gaulle, that Europe should extend from the Atlantic to the Urals.  We have gone a long way in that direction since we became members of the European Economic Community in 1973.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure we want to go that far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised at the Deputy.  Of course I am not suggesting that under this treaty we will go that far.  However, I am making the point that we have gone a long way in that direction.  Therefore it is important that we look at the European institutions to ascertain how they can be more efficient and responsive to their citizens and to the national parliaments in the member states.</P>
        <P>Throughout our membership, we have been asked at regular intervals to approve treaties which have been the building blocks of the Union as it evolved.  Each major step taken by the Union now seems self-evidently to have been the right one.  However, that was not always appreciated at the time.  The prospect of change intimidates even to the point of stopping us from taking the decisions that are needed and from looking in an objective way at where the best interests of both Ireland and Europe lie.  Each major advance by the Union took courage and a belief in the future of Europe.  The reform treaty represents the latest stage of the evolution of the European Union.  It paves the way for a more effective EU which can serve the needs of Europe, and thereby the best interests of Ireland, in the decades ahead.</P>
        <P>The treaty is long and technical in nature and as such does not easily lend itself to campaign slogans and soundbites.  In general, EU issues do not generate the kind of excitement and enthusiasm often associated with the cut and thrust, and adventures and misadventures of domestic political debate.  I am reminded of another great Frenchman, Jacques Delors, who once said: &ldquo;You cannot fall in love with the single European market.&rdquo;  The French, after all, are the great authorities on love in the modern world.  While it may be difficult to form a passionate attachment to the terms of a treaty, we cannot deny its importance to the development of the EU and its internal workings for the foreseeable future.  The treaty will give the Union the flexibility and the capacity to face many major challenges that Europe faces in the <Col N="52"/>decades ahead.  There is no doubt that there is a need to restructure the workings of the Union to take account of its enlarged membership and the various issues now confronting Europe.</P>
        <P>Opponents of the reform treaty use a number of lines of attack.  It is suggested that they are not against the Union even though they campaigned against every previous referendum on the matter.  It is acknowledged that Europe has achieved for Ireland and I am glad that that grudging admission can now be wrought out of those who oppose the treaty.  However, it is then suggested the treaty will take the Union in a negative direction.  Deputy Breen spoke about this in his contribution.  I was very interested in his contribution, particularly in the later stage where he listed a series of false suggestions that are commonly propagated about the European ideal.  It is disturbing in our domestic debate on Europe that every time we have a European referendum the same issues are produced: neutrality, abortion, a military super state and conscription.  All these subjects are raised even though they have nothing to do with the treaty.  While of course we have full sovereignty in these matters and it is important that we debate them as a Parliament, it seems extraordinary that these subjects are only debated when we have a referendum on Europe and are no longer debated on their own intrinsic merits and demerits.  That is as it lies and is the system with which we must argue.</P>
        <P>There will of course be the argument that has been made in every referendum since 1972 that there will be an erosion of national sovereignty and the emergence of a European super state.  We have argued all this before and we have had all the warnings in predecessor treaties and they have all been proved baseless in time.  Had we listened to the doubters on previous occasions, we would never have had the euro, which was provided for in the Treaty of Maastricht.  It has been a key element in our recent economic success and a major convenience and ease for the travelling public.</P>
        <P>The arguments against the European treaties have not changed and are broadly the same as those used to argue against joining the Common Market in 1972.  Deputy Quinn is sitting very easily in his seat.  I remind him that then Deputy Conor Cruise O&rsquo;Brien at the time expressed grave unhappiness at the fact that the Labour Party was constrained to provide the &ldquo;no&rdquo; argument in the then European campaign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>As I was.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, Deputy Quinn was not a Member of the Oireachtas and was not as constrained as then Deputy Cruise O&rsquo;Brien was at the time.  Those who oppose the treaty and opposed previous treaties have a duty to explain what future they see for this country.  They seem to be offering a march towards isolationism and economic decline &mdash; an Albanianisation of Ireland, so to speak.  There is no doubt the Union has brought great economic benefits to the Irish people.  States are clamouring to join the Union.  Many of them cite Ireland as an example of the road they wish to follow.  We need to bring it down to this question for the people in the referendum: is Europe to be viewed as a threat for Ireland or an opportunity?  We must put across to the people that our experience in the past 35 years shows the opportunities that can be availed of in Europe.  There are major opportunities for us in the Europe of the future also.</P>
        <P>Our command of the English language is a huge advantage to us in the Europe that is now evolving, where English, in effect, has become the<i> lingua franca</i> &mdash; if Deputies will forgive the phrase &mdash; of the modern Europe.</P>

	<P Just="Left">That is extraordinary.  I must say I have a great attachment to our ancestral language and speak it.  It is very appropriate on some occasions but as far as Europe is concerned, it is a fact that the members of the European family are increasingly using English as their common language.  I realise that the French tradition does not welcome that particular development but the reality is that the central and eastern European states that have joined the EU, which spoke French in the inter-war period and Russian after 1945, see English as the international language of the future.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I could be even more heretical for a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy and confess that I have always had a secret admiration for Daniel O&rsquo;Connell in this respect.  He was a very good Irish speaker, by the way.  He did not lose his Irish by speaking English but he did believe that English was the language of the world.  It is certainly the language of the European world and that is something to which we should attend.</P>
        <P>The treaty will help the European Union to become more democratic by strengthening the role of national parliaments and giving them a direct say in European legislation.  That is very important because one of the difficulties with the European Parliament is that it does not derive its mandate from a regular election in the national electoral timescale.  As a result, with the best will in the world, European parliamentarians are often seen as detached from the concerns of domestic electorates.  I believe it is a good move in this treaty to associate the national parliaments more closely with the legislative process in Europe.</P>
        <P>The treaty also gives national parliaments a right of veto on any proposal to change the voting rules in the European Council or the Council of Ministers from unanimity to qualified majority voting.  There is also a citizens initiative and it is important in a block the size of the European Union that everything possible is done to link the citizen with the Union.  A very significant element in this regard is the provision to give legal status to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  This means that, just as in our Constitution where the duties and powers of the Government are circumscribed by the fundamental rights of the citizen, in the European arrangement, the duties and rights of the European institutions are circumscribed by a respect for the fundamental rights of the European citizen.</P>
        <P>This is one of the most positive features of this treaty but it will be misrepresented.  It will be suggested that this is an erosion of the guarantees in our Constitution but it is not.  In fact, one of the main objectives of our diplomacy in the negotiation of this treaty was to ensure that the text leaves no equivocation or doubt on the point that the European guarantees are in the European legal order and we will continue to have national guarantees in our national legal order.  That is a fundamental point in relation to this treaty and it is right that a community that will be based on the rule of law should allow its citizens to invoke fundamental rules of law to invalidate decisions of that Union that infringe the basic rights of the European citizen.  That is a very positive development in this treaty and is the one development that does bring the individual citizen closer to the European Union because it allows the individual to challenge, on his or her own, a decision of the European Union which he or she believes has fundamentally trenched upon his or her rights.</P>
        <P>When one looks at the arguments that we are faced with in the referendum &mdash; it is a good exercise to hold a referendum because it forces us to engage with the public and their concerns <Col N="54"/>about Europe &mdash; so many of them relate to fundamental rights.  People argue that they should have the right to cut turf, catch fish, harvest seaweed, obtain planning permission and so forth, but that there is a European rule which obstructs this.  However, under this treaty, people will be entitled to challenge the European Union on the basis of their own individual rights.  Intellectually, that is a very important change for Europe to make because at present the difficulty is that the power arrangements are seen as remote and bureaucratic as far as the individual citizen is concerned.  At present, the European citizen in the European legal order does not have the right to invalidate a decision taken within the European legal order by the authorities.  Our citizens do have that right under our Constitution in relation to decisions we take in this House.  That, along with our electoral system, has brought the citizen very close to the Irish State.  It is worth looking at this as a positive feature in this campaign.  It is not one we should skirt around.  We should be open about it.</P>
        <P>I regretted very much the fact that the United Kingdom decided to opt out of the Charter on Fundamental Rights.  There was no reason to do so, but it did.  We did not follow the United Kingdom in that respect, even though we were offered that facility.  I would have been very saddened if we had exercised that option because it is one of the most crucial reasons for voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the context of bringing Europe closer to the citizen.  It makes the Union more democratic and more effective.</P>
        <P>During the negotiations, Ireland ensured that certain national vital interests were secured in diplomatic terms, including the issue of unanimity on taxation and the question of our possible involvement in military matters.  On all of these matters we were essentially given the right to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; under this treaty.  Other Ministers have dealt with that issue already.</P>
        <P>I wish to turn to the area of justice because there was some debate about it in the process leading up to the ratification of the treaty.  Ireland has consistently and strongly supported EU measures to tackle organised crime and terrorism and to strengthen law enforcement co-operation.  That will continue to be the case when the reform treaty is ratified.  I assure the House that Ireland will be participating in European measures in police co-operation and in justice to the maximum possible extent.  Examples of the benefits of EU membership in the justice area include the development of the European arrest warrant, which ensures criminals cannot escape justice by fleeing to another member state, and the establishment of Europol, the European police agency, which gives practical support to national police forces in tackling cross-border crime.  The European Union is also active in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, including drug trafficking.</P>
        <P>The reform treaty provides generally for majority voting in the field of criminal law and police co-operation.  However, because of the especially sensitive nature of criminal law co-operation and the fact we have a distinctive common law system, we decided to avail of a special arrangement which would allow the State to participate in EU criminal law and police co-operation measures on a case by case basis.</P>
        <P>It is correct that in the original draft treaty, both the United Kingdom and Ireland bound themselves to qualified majority voting in this area.  The United Kingdom, however, secured in the negotiations last year, at the initiative of the German Chancellor, a concession whereby, in effect, it was allowed to opt out of qualified majority voting in this area.  That put us in a very difficult position in a European context.  We were happy with qualified majority voting with the United Kingdom on board because we both share a very similar legal system and legal culture.  However, it would have been a big ask for Ireland to participate in qualified majority voting on legal questions with the United Kingdom outside the room and Ireland left in the invidious position of being the only effective common law jurisdiction left, with the other 26 member states.  It would not be legitimate for me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="55"/>Reform, to depend on an Irish Taoiseach to raise such an issue under the emergency brake mechanism.  That is not the kind of issue that is important enough for Ireland to entrust to a Taoiseach to raise with other member states.  The United Kingdom was in a different position and certainly the defence of the common law could be a legitimate diplomatic objective for a British Prime Minister but it is certainly not one I would wish to foist on a future Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>Having examined the whole question, we decided the best course for Ireland, at this stage, was to avail of the facility which Chancellor Merkel offered us, after she had offered it to the United Kingdom and to Prime Minister Brown.  The Government went through this issue very carefully.  We had a considered debate on the issue, examined two points of view on it and came to a conclusion as to where we should go on it.  However, I wish to emphasise that we made a strong declaration, published in the treaty, underlining our firm intention to participate to the maximum possible extent in justice proposals and, in particular, those relating to police co-operation.</P>
        <P>We also decided that the arrangements agreed will be reviewed three years after the treaty comes into effect.  This will give us an opportunity to examine how the new arrangements operate in practice.  While I think we made the right decision at this stage, it is possible to envisage circumstances in the future where it might be in our best interests to accede to qualified majority voting in this area.  Suppose, for example, from a justice perspective, a group of member states emerged which was recalcitrant in regard to effective co-operation in matters of border control or essential security that affected our State and we believed we were in a diplomatic position to rally a majority of the member states behind us.  In those circumstances it would clearly be in Ireland&rsquo;s best interests to participate in a qualified majority voting arrangement.  We will, therefore, not totally close the door on that but we will ensure the right to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, the essence of sovereignty, is preserved in this context for the reasons I outlined.  I am satisfied the Government&rsquo;s position on justice matters is the best to ensure our legal system is protected and, at the same time, our strong co-operation with our European partners is maintained in tackling serious cross-border crime.  I have made it clear to Commissioner Frattini since my appointment that Ireland is very much committed to co-operation in the justice area to the maximum extent.</P>
        <P>I do not have a dogmatic view that the common law is superior to the civil law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike some of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Both systems have their characteristic strengths and weaknesses.  Both often arrive at the same conclusion in resolving a particular legal dispute but both use different characteristic procedures and substantive legal rules to arrive at the conclusion and that is why there is a difficulty in this area.  We must understand that we have a great deal to learn from civil law jurisdictions as they have to learn from common law jurisdictions and, therefore, we should not put ourselves in a dogmatic position on this issue.  However, we should safeguard our vital interests and not leave the Taoiseach or myself having to have a major row with our European partners on a drafting matter.  That is how I view the justice issue essentially.</P>
        <P>Generally the treaty will make the Union more democratic, provide a more effective system of making decisions and ensure the rights of the Union&rsquo;s citizens are better protected, which is very important, especially if the rights, powers and competencies in the justice area are extended.  Along with the competencies and powers given to police forces, a culture of respect for rights must be ensured.  The charter will foster a culture of respect for rights in the Union.  This is the key element we are putting into the European equation in this treaty and for that reason, and because it equips the Community to deal with the many challenges Europe faces, I am delighted to support the treaty.</P><Col N="56"/>
        <P>We must vigorously campaign to secure a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  As a politician, I prefer field research.  I am a great believer that politics is a flesh and blood business and, on the basis of such research, I believe at heart the people are sympathetic to this proposal but we must get them out to vote.  That is the major task facing us over the next few weeks because there is a determined minority who like to wreck referenda on this subject.  However, the broad mass of the citizenry understand what this is about.  We must bring the information and the persuasion to the people and talk to them.  It is a matter of engaging with them, addressing their legitimate concerns and explaining how this is good for Ireland and Europe and it is not a matter of dropping leaflets in letter boxes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.</P>
        <P>I am a former spokesperson on European affairs and I have had the honour and privilege to represent Ireland at European Councils.  I am also the chairperson of the Irish Alliance for Europe, an organisation representing all political parties and the social partners, which is dedicated to achieving a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  I am pleased to follow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform because he has assured the House, about which I am delighted but not surprised, that the common &ldquo;lawists&rdquo; of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green have at last a Minister who is prepared to recognise the positive benefits of both the common law and civil law traditions.  That has been a difficulty for many people in the past who were not trained lawyers, including myself.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty represents five years of concentrated work beginning with the Laacken Declaration and the convention that preceded it where for the first time a treaty of reform of the Union&rsquo;s institutions was formulated, not by an intergovernmental conference comprising civil servants and politicians but by a much more representative body comprising members of national parliaments, the European Parliament, social partners, governments and prospective Union members.  The constitutional treaty was defeated by the French and Dutch but it was ratified by 18 other member states, which is often ignored.  The Lisbon treaty is the constitutional treaty in reverse.  A total of 95% of the provisions of the treaty were contained in the constitutional treaty.  Commissioner Wallstr&ouml;m, who is responsible for communicating information about Europe, was challenged by a stern commentator on this when asked what was the difference between both.  She was asked if the reform treaty is 95% the same, why it was being proposed again.  She responded that scientific research proves 95% of our DNA is the same as that of a mouse but that is not to suggest there is no difference between us and mice.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty, therefore, is different in a number of respects and it is the only treaty on offer.  A better Europe is not around the corner if Ireland votes &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  There is no suggestion that if we could somehow force people back to the drawing board again, we would achieve an improved treaty.  Patricia McKenna and others have made this point.  The treaty is plan Z, not plan A or B, in implementing the operational pillars for decision-making.  Some people will say they will be made to vote again and another referendum will be held if a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote succeeds.</P>
        <P>However, the past 20 years must be put in context.  When the Maastricht treaty was trundling through negotiations before being referred to member states, the Europe in which we lived was a different place from the Europe that emerged following the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989.  When Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, it comprised nine members.  The number increased to ten when Greece emerged from dictatorship and it was followed by Spain and Portugal.  However, four sophisticated and prosperous states &mdash; Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway &mdash; decided for various reasons not to join the Union.  Only when the Berlin Wall came down did a new geopolitical landscape open up.  Nobody predicted that not only would the wall come down but communism would collapse and the bipolar superpower world, which we had all grown up with and took as a given, would disappear.  As a consequence, we had to <Col N="57"/>consider a new Europe that, unforeseen by any of us, could potentially be reunited in a way none of our generation had experienced.</P>
        <P>We have been struggling with a 20-year project and not just the constitutional and reform treaties.  Next year will be the 20th anniversary of the collapse of the Berlin Wall.  Since then, we have struggled with how to consolidate the Union in legal terms under the Treaty of Rome and the European Court of Justice while, at the same time, co-ordinating foreign and justice and home affairs policies, maintaining the sovereignty necessary for nation states and ensuring the integrated co-operation required.  The House and the public should recognise the treaty is the conclusion of a particular project.  This is the fifth attempt to finally put in place a constitutional arrangement for the Union, which makes it fit for purpose in the 21st century.</P>
        <P>The story of the Union has two parts, one of which is the history of the 20th century and how Europe was continually at war.  As Deputy Pat Breen said, three generations, if not more, continuously went to war against each other.  If the Irish people think we were neutral in this particular set of conflicts, they should walk into any Church of Ireland church in the country and look at the plaques on the walls.  They will see that generation after generation of Irish people fought, Protestants as officers and Catholics as foot soldiers.</P>
        <P>It is the same in most countries.  We have been engaged in every war Europe ever fought going right back to Fontenoy.  To suggest that somehow or other we stayed out of wars is a nonsense.  It is only that reconciliation in Northern Ireland has enabled us now to validate and recognise the history we share and for some families to come out of the closet and state they had relatives who died honourably on behalf of small nations, as many did in Flanders.</P>
        <P>The history of Europe is in two parts.  The 20th century version of Europe is how to deal with the problems which borders create, such as the divisions of nations and peoples, the antagonisms, and the excessive nationalism which brought generation after generation to war against each other with the ensuing slaughter.  Perhaps the worst victims were not those who died, but those who survived.  What the European Union did in the 20th century was to remove the problems of borders and create an internal market, a single currency and a space in which we could get on with our own business.</P>
        <P>This is the history which belongs to my generation.  My 13 year old son sees Adolf Hitler, Napoleon and Julius Caesar in the same timeframe, as history.  It is of interest to me because I was born a year after Berlin was liberated by the red army.  However, it is history to my children and my grandchildren and to subsequent generations.</P>
        <P>The second part of the history of Europe is the history of the 21st century, which is how Europeans can cope with problems which do not recognise borders and how they can combine their strengths and confront those issues which do not recognise frontiers, custom posts or border police.  These include trafficking of women and children, drugs, crime, armaments, climate change and negotiating with strength with the new globalised economic powers of India and China, not to mention dealing with the declining empire of the United States whose currency is in freefall and whose institutions need to be radically re-internationalised.  The settlement at Bretton Woods which was designed to construct a new economic order after the end of the Second World War is no longer a valid settlement.  The use of the dollar as an international reserve currency on its own for commodity pricing whether it is coffee or cotton is no longer sufficient.</P>
        <P>I will not go into the detail of the Lisbon treaty as it will be dealt with elsewhere and by other people.  The emotional engine for the Lisbon treaty is the completion of this process since the collapse of the Berlin wall and the creation of a Europe for the 21st century which is fit for purpose.  It is not the best treaty around.  It is not the type of Europe that I would like to <Col N="58"/>have seen.  However, it is the only Europe around.  Those who state, &ldquo;Vote No for a better Europe&rdquo; are actually stating, &ldquo;Vote No to stop Europe in its tracks&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We are at a time when the world has changed and after 15 years of positive economic growth we are now confronted with a slowdown over which we do not have much control.  We are confronted with the price of oil being more than $100 a barrel over which we do not have control.  We are confronted with the sub-prime crisis from unregulated greedy capitalism which has created a field of landmines in our now globalised financial institutions, the consequences of which we simply do not know the extent.</P>
        <P>In the midst of all this uncertainty which has only occurred since last July, if we were to deliberately and consciously vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to making Europe fit for purpose for the 21st century, what message would it send to ourselves and to the rest of the world?  We have the most open globalised market economy within Europe.  We need as much certainty at a time of uncertainty we can possibly get.  In the areas in which we do have control, such as the referendum on the Lisbon treaty, we must resoundingly vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  I support the Bill.</P>

        <P>Ireland has a place in Europe.  Co-operation with our European partners is essential if we are to meet the challenges facing us in the time ahead.  Contrary to what the Government has claimed, no matter how many people vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum Ireland&rsquo;s future place in the EU will be secure.  The fact is that one can support the EU and be against the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>This debate is about the implications of the Lisbon treaty for Ireland, Europe and the wider world.  My party believes the Lisbon treaty is a bad deal.  It was badly negotiated and is a bad result for the Irish people.  It gives the EU too much power and reduces Ireland&rsquo;s ability to stop decisions that are not in our interests.  It is shameful that the Government has signed up to and is now advocating ratification of a treaty which undermines the interest of the Irish people. The Government has a responsibility to protect the interests of the people and once again on this occasion it has failed to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are told that all countries are being treated equally.  However, Ireland&rsquo;s voting strength is being cut in half while the voting strength of larger countries such as Britain and Germany is nearly doubled.  That is equality, Government-wise.  I have listened to the Government and Opposition benches &mdash; if it is Opposition - and they have told us that it is not practical or efficient to have 27 Commissioners.  Let us make a quick comparison with the other side of the Chamber.  We have 15 Ministers and 20 Ministers of State for a population of just less than 5 million people.  It seems more than credible and necessary to have 27 Commissioners to represent more than 500 million people.</P>
        <P>Let no one be fooled by the limited monitoring powers extended to member state parliaments or by the citizens initiative.  These gestures, no doubt intended to take the bad look off the treaty, do not address the democratic deficit or the loss of sovereignty.  It is irresponsible to undermine parliamentary democracy at home by ceding more powers to the EU Commission and the Council.  However, this is exactly what we are being asked to do.</P>
        <P>Previously, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, argued that we have not outlined the 105 areas with additional or altered powers under the treaty.  He is basing his figures on a British <Col N="59"/>institute, the Schumann school of economics, which states it is 33.  I have a list which I can present to any Minister or Member of the House which outlines exactly, word for word from the treaty, 105 areas which will be altered.  A total of 68 areas which currently require consensus will be transferred to QMV.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Our position as a military neutral has been systematically undermined by the Government.  The use of Shannon airport by US troops on their way to sustain the brutal occupation of Iraq is just one example.  There is no mention of the military neutrals in the Lisbon treaty.  The Government did not even try to secure recognition of the rights and responsibilities of EU neutrals. However, it agreed to compatibility with NATO.  It also agreed to a substantial expansion in the range of Petersberg Tasks in which the EU battle groups can engage.  In previous referenda we were told we would not have an EU European army and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, is in denial.  Its military adventures in Chad will cost the Irish taxpayer &euro;40 million this year.</P>

	<P>Do not shout me down.  I will speak in this House and outside, if required.  The Lisbon treaty also contains a mutual defence clause.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>That money comes from the taxpayer.  The Minister is denying that this provision exists in the treaty.  Perhaps he would like to have the record corrected in respect of the misleading announcement he made earlier.  Unlike the Danes, the Irish Government did not seek or secure an opt-out from the European defence agency.  It is disappointing that the Green Party, so vocal on these issues in the past, has remained quiet now.  I can think <Col N="61"/>of many schools, hospitals and community groups that would like to receive a small portion of the &euro;8 million per annum spent by Ministers on the promotion of nuclear power through the EURATOM Treaty, another matter on which the Green Party has remained silent.</P>
        <P>There has been a great deal of scaremongering during this debate in respect of the economy.  Some of my colleagues will return to prove this treaty will affect our economy in the future and to deny what the Minister, the Labour Party and Fine Gael have said.  It is not too late for us.  Even at this late stage, the Government can withdraw from this process.

	<P>I welcome the Bill and the White Paper, which I look forward to studying.  Membership of what is now the European Union has been, during the past 35 years, a vital factor enabling Ireland, following centuries of vicissitudes, to make dramatic progress fulfilling its destiny as a nation.</P>
        <P>According to Dr. Hillary, Emile No&euml;l, former Secretary General of the European Commission, once described Ireland&rsquo;s joining the EEC in 1973 as our second declaration of independence.  Our European commitment is entirely consistent with and a working out of our religious, cultural, nationalist and republican traditions.  Some of the European founding fathers sought to make St. Columbanus the patron saint of a united Europe as demonstrated last August by an exhibition in Rimini.</P>
        <P>In 1627, as the late Cardinal O&rsquo;Fiaich was delighted to discover, Eoghan Ruadh O&rsquo;Neill wrote to Philip IV of Spain proposing that an independent Irish Republic be placed under Spanish protection.  Thomas Davis, in private a conservative as opposed to a militant or radical republican, wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">Foreign alliances have always stood among the pillars of national power.  Again, it is particularly needful for Ireland to have a foreign policy.  Intimacy with the great powers will guard us from English interference.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He had in mind countries such as France and the leading German states.  This was echoed in the 1916 Proclamation with its reference to gallant allies in Europe.</P>
        <P>Today, EU partnership is able to embrace Britain and continental Europe and to transcend the conflicts and oppositions of the past.  We have different allies according to the subject under discussion &mdash; Britain and Sweden on tax sovereignty; France and Poland on the CAP.  We are part of the inner eurozone circle but not of Schengen.  When Se&aacute;n McDiarmada was asked in 1916 why a republic, he referred to the examples of France and America.  The former, he stated, had been a firm friend of Ireland for generations while millions of Irish people had played a central role in the latter.</P><Col N="62"/>
        <P Just="Left">Thomas Addis Emmet, later attorney general of New York, told a secret parliamentary committee into the causes of the 1798 rebellion in answer to a question from the Archbishop of Cashel about the economic viability of an independent Ireland:  &ldquo;America is the best market in the world and Ireland the best situated country in Europe to trade with that market.&rdquo;  It is a remarkable prophecy of our present geo-economic situation with many US companies choosing Ireland as a base to trade into the European market.  His brother Robert &mdash; they were both grandchildren of a Tipperary doctor &mdash; looked forward in his famous speech from the dock to Ireland taking its place among the nations of the earth.  For us, the most intensive concert of nations takes place in the European Union to which practically every European country belongs or wishes to belong with rare exception.</P>
        <P>Since Ireland joined what is now the European Union, employment has virtually doubled, emigration has been reversed and our living standards have been raised from under two-thirds of the EU average to above it, even on the most conservative measure.  It has helped us to make enormous economic, social and environmental progress.  Ireland has received &euro;40 billion in subsidies which has enabled us to transform nearly every sector of our economy.</P>
        <P>The policy of successive Governments to place Ireland at the heart of Europe has been a highly successful diplomatic strategy.  As French President Nicolas Sarkozy told his British hosts recently, &ldquo;If you are a full member of Europe, you have more of a say than if you are on the margins&rdquo;.  That is the nub of the argument.  We need to maximise our influence on decisions of concern which are being taken and deliberated upon practically every week in Brussels.  No one would understand why a member state which has done so well out of membership in terms of radically improving its position, a major success story of the EU, would rebuff and try to block the organisation that has made it all possible.  Politicians and diplomats from countries such as Denmark that were forced by referendum in 1992 to opt out of European policies deeply regret that marginalisation and want to reverse it.</P>
        <P>The treaty makes no dramatic changes to the way the EU is organised.  The former Latvian president, Mrs. Vike Freiberga, was right when she told the forum on Europe that most countries felt it did not justify a further referendum which was optional for them, particularly as the referendums in nine of the 12 accession states had been able to take many issues arising from the convention report of 2003 into account.  The French have reversed their decision on the treaty and ratified it.  The French rejection was not a lasting one; it has been reversed in a perfectly acceptable democratic manner according to their rules by the representatives of the French people and representative democracy is just as valid as direct democracy.  The Dutch will soon do the same.</P>
        <P>The British Eurosceptics are well on the way to being defeated in their own country and their own parliament but would love a proxy victory here, even though they have nothing to offer this country and never had and we, not they, would pay most of the price.  It would be monstrous if Britain, with its level of scepticism, ratified the treaty, while we who have always been loyal, constructive and committed Europeans, chose to reject ratification.  People who ask to do this have not thought through how deeply damaging it would be to the national interest.  If the claim is that the treaty was badly negotiated from Ireland&rsquo;s point of view, that sort of diplomatic strategy would be absolutely appalling.</P>
        <P>Every party with experience of Government, practically every representative organisation among the social partners, is advocating a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote and they know what they are doing.  With the level of financial turbulence in the world today, it is no time to take unnecessary risks or to damage the confidence so important to investors that we are well placed in Brussels to influence and shape the decisions that are important to us and to them.</P><Col N="63"/>
        <P>Arguments about sovereignty are like ones about personal freedom.  In theory a person with no job, no fixed place of abode, no family ties, is freer than someone who has all of these things, but that is to confuse freedom from constraint with the positive freedom to achieve which is generally possible only through ties and co-operation networks.  Cuba, Burma, Albania and North Korea may be the most sovereign countries in the world with few ties to anywhere else but they are also among the most impoverished.</P>
        <P>Ireland has an interest in being part of an effective European Union that works, not an minimalist intergovernmental structure with nobody to look after the community interest.  A Commission of 30 members and more would not be an effective functioning body and needs to be streamlined, otherwise all the real work will be done in committees.  There need be little fear of a super-state, a Thatcherite phrase, confined to a budget of around 1% of GDP.  The President of the European Council will only be able to speak on behalf of the Union when so mandated.  He or she will not be more powerful than the German Chancellor or the French President and it is notable that neither of them is applying for the job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What are some people afraid of?  Where is the actual evidence of the increased militarisation conjured up at each referendum campaign?  On the contrary, all the evidence and all the figures would show reduced military budgets over the past 20 years across Europe, reduced personnel and the phasing out of conscription in the few countries where it remains.  What is wrong with increased international engagement?  Are we not all, but especially those on the left, meant to be internationalist in outlook?  De Valera strongly advocated this in 1946 in a debate on membership of the United Nations and in particular on the enforcement of obligations and the enforcement of rights.  He added, &ldquo;If there is ever to be a rule of law nations must make up their minds they will take part in such enforcement.&rdquo;  Since when has abortion arrived in Ireland?  The principle of subsidiarity still holds. Socio-moral legislation is a matter for us.  The EU Charter of Rights, an extension of the<b> </b>European Convention on Human Rights, to which we are already party, does not change the position nor replace the constitution of member states, which it cannot be used to override.  Is it not true that the European Union has been the most effective instrument of regional peace that the world has ever seen, and also one of the most pro-life organisations, in that since 1945 generations of young adults have not been slaughtered on the battlefields of Europe?</P>
        <P>Church leaders, including successive popes, well understand the big picture and have always been supportive of the European project.  In an address to diplomatic heads of mission in the Vatican before Christmas, Pope Benedict XVI said that the Lisbon treaty, &ldquo;gives a boost to the process of building the European home&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is there not something deeply incongruous about a party, whose deputy leader, who is also Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland, recently went to Europe with the First Minister, Dr. Paisley, jointly seeking increased EU aid to underpin peace and stability, yet whose policy requires it to campaign against this treaty?  It has campaigned against all EU treaties.  If, as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh acknowledged on a previous occasion, Europe has done a lot of good things, then which of the treaties should Sinn F&eacute;in have supported in order to make these good things possible?  As Karl Marx once said, &ldquo;If you will the end, you must will the means.&rdquo;  A leading member in the North acknowledged to me some years ago that Sinn F&eacute;in has not updated its European policy in 30 years.  One could argue that it is at least 50 years out of date.  The marginal short-term political advantage of saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; will be as illusory here as it has been for the Tory Party across the water.  Anti-Europeanism could be a serious barrier to future participation in Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in claims to champion a united Ireland which can only come about with consent, not realising or wishing to acknowledge that one of the most significant attractions of the Republic to the Northern business community is our deeper involvement in Europe.  I have to smile when I hear that party present itself as a champion of sovereignty, <Col N="64"/>neutrality and parliamentary democracy.  Is that the same parliamentary democracy that Deputy Morgan a few weeks ago called &ldquo;a partial parliament in a little semi-statelet&rdquo;?  The following morning on radio, when I was debating with him, he declined to say that the Government of the Republic was not the army council of the Provisional IRA.  This is talk of neutrality from a party whose comrades only declared their war with Britain over in 2005.  It is a pity this was not thought about for 30 years when hundreds of millions of taxpayers&rsquo; money that could have been spent on developing this country were spent on Border security.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Union operates on a balanced political philosophy.  It is neither excessively neo-liberal, nor hardline socialist or state interventionist.  I would be equally distrustful of ultra-leftism and of the visceral Thatcherite hostility to Europe commonplace in certain sections of the British media which a millionaire-led organisation called Libertas would like to import into Ireland.  Its running away from cross-questioning at the forum on Europe this morning speaks volumes for the incoherence and incredibility of its case against the treaty.  I am sure Fine Gael Deputy Lucinda Creighton welcomes the publicity of being on a Libertas poster in her constituency and would be rightly dismissive of the politically naive attempt to damage her.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The treaty is in essence our treaty, one which the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, negotiated with great skill in 2004, much to the admiration of his peers in Europe.  A lot of good preparatory work was also done by Irish members of the convention from all parties.  Enlargement means we have to share, that our part will slightly diminish.  Our influence does not depend on our isolated voting strength in any of the institutions, but on our alliances and partnerships with like-minded countries that have similar interests.  Larger states until recently had two Commissioners but from 2014, like us, they will have none from time to time.  At least on that point they are making the bigger sacrifice.  As a mature member state of 35 years, we have many ways of bringing our influence to bear on or within the Commission in which there are very experienced senior Irish officials.  It would make no diplomatic sense to vote down a treaty desired by the governments of all our partners.  A vote by one country, large or small, is not sustainable or tenable beyond the very short term as the interests of the individual country and the union would suffer.  In the 1970s a very small state, Malta, was in the habit of vetoing progress in the CSCE, or the Helsinki negotiations, a form of sore thumb diplomacy.  It did nothing for it or anyone else.</P>
        <P>Which threats to our interests, and there are some, under existing treaties would be removed by advocating a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote?  Ireland would gain nothing from such a manoeuvre and no one has explained what the short, medium or long-term gains from such a strategy would be.  People say we would remain full members of the Union, that is as it may be, but we would be much diminished.  Could people who are advocating a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote spell out what we or the Union, of which we are part, would gain from that?  Do we not have a certain interest in the prosperity and strength of the European Union of which we are members?  We know the gains we have made from European Union membership and for putting Ireland at the heart of Europe.  Let us stick to a winning strategy and vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the publication of this Bill.  The Lisbon reform treaty is an outcome of a long negotiation process.  Much of the substance of the reform treaty was negotiated under Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency in 2004.  I congratulate our negotiation team on a job well done.  On the issues of particular national interest, it was able to shape the outcome in ways that fully respect our interests.</P>
        <P>When Ireland joined the Union, the EEC as it was then, in 1973 there were nine members.  Today there are 27 EU member states, 12 more than there were five years ago.  The EU has trebled in size since we joined in 1973.  Now that the Union has expanded to 27 member states, <Col N="65"/>common sense dictates that a larger organisation needs to revise its rule in order to advance the common good.  Streamlining the decision-making process of the EU institutions will make them more effective, efficient and flexible.  The Lisbon treaty is fundamentally about modernising the EU&rsquo;s institutions to ensure they work better for EU citizens.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is firmly pro-European and we have demonstrated our commitment to Europe through vigorous and energetic campaigns in favour of a strengthened European Union.  I regard EU membership as a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s success.  I have always urged people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for a better Europe and &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for a better Ireland.  Our citizens should vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the Lisbon treaty referendum because it offers the best deal for Ireland and for Europe.</P>
        <P>In the treaty referendum each voter will make a once off decision based on a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; choice.  This treaty represents the best balance of interest between good co-operation with other EU member states and the protection of our national interests.  However, for some, the decision might be seen to involve a degree of future uncertainty and risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a businessman and entrepreneur, I believe an important aspect of voter decision-making is to be optimistic for the future.  The entrepreneurial approach to decision-making has to do with vision, imagination, enthusiasm and self-confidence.  The entrepreneurial thinking process understands that if new opportunities are to be successfully grasped it is important not to act based on yesterday&rsquo;s logic.  With an entrepreneurial approach, the voter will select the plan that is proactive and positive on the optimistic assumption that the benefits flowing from the plan will be achieved while the possible risks will be managed and any perceived downsides will be avoided.  With a positive, self-confident outlook to the future, the entrepreneur will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  From a business point of view and having regard to the advantages of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in attracting business to Ireland, hopefully a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote will be secured, given its potential to create jobs and attract investment from the US in particular.</P>
        <P>For the entrepreneurial decision maker, the issues of likely reward and possible risk go together.  On the reward side, all past experience points to the fact that being a full and active member of the EU has brought substantial economic and social benefits to Ireland and its citizens.  This outcome is demonstrably quantified.  One only has to think of the euro in one&rsquo;s pocket to understand that the EU has been beneficial for Ireland.  On the possible risk side, there is a confidence that specific actions for the management and mitigation of potential risk factors can be taken to ensure the risk element can be avoided into the future.  There is a clear understanding that the risk factors can only be managed from a position of influence within the process of the implementation of the decision.  One cannot manage potential risk factors as a spectator looking on.</P>
        <P>The choices available to the voter in the treaty referendum are a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The simplicity of choice could possibly mislead the voter in the sense that a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote is for the treaty and all its future change implications while a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote represents the <i>status quo</i>.  In many significant ways, this perspective is misleading.  In some ways, it is easier for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote to sound warnings about the future.  Arguments around the perception of maintaining the <i>status quo</i> can be superficially attractive.  A &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in the referendum is essentially a negative assessment.  It is an act based on the premise that the worst will happen and, therefore, voting &ldquo;no&rdquo; will give the best protection under such adverse conditions.  Leaving things as they are does not ensure that the current position will be kept the same, rather it subjects it to a torrent of uncontrolled and perhaps uncontrollable change.  A &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote can be reasonably represented as a strategy of evasion in the unreasonable expectation that given some time, things will sort themselves out.</P>
        <P>Many of the arguments against the Lisbon treaty are simply recycled versions of &ldquo;no&rdquo; arguments put forward during every EU referendum held since 1972.  These negative arguments <Col N="66"/>were ill-founded then and they are equally so now.  According to Mary Lou McDonald, MEP, Sinn F&eacute;in opposes the Lisbon treaty not because its members are eurosceptics but because they are ambitious for Europe and because they believe that, collectively and democratically, Europeans can achieve great things.  They claim to be pro-European while at the same time opposing this treaty.</P>
        <P>The argument that we should reject this agreement and go back and negotiate a better deal must sound familiar to Sinn F&eacute;in leadership.  It would have heard a great deal of that type of argument during and after the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement.  As a democratic political party, it must know in its heart and intellect that this is a barren, fruitless and irresponsible strategy.  Telling the negotiation team to go back and get a different deal is not how international agreements are concluded and honoured.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty contains a real and meaningful response to concerns regarding the perceived lack of democratic accountability within the EU.  The treaty contains a number of provisions aimed at reinforcing the national parliamentary dimension in the EU by extending national democratic control over decisions at EU level and ensuring greater transparency in the decision-making process.</P>
        <P>A recent eurobarometer survey showed that while a large majority of Irish people support EU membership, only a quarter of us believe that our opinion counts when the EU makes decisions.  This is an indication of how disconnected citizens feel between their everyday lives and the EU institutions.  The reality is, however, that EU legislation, in the form of directives, regulations or decisions, has a real impact on the everyday lives of all EU citizens and it is negotiated on behalf of citizens by their governments.  The primary legislator in European society is the national parliament, the true democratic expression representative of the citizen.  In this context and in recognition of the growing importance of EU legislation and the need to hold the Government accountable for the negotiation of this legislation, the Oireachtas has established a Joint Committee on European Scrutiny.</P>
        <P>The central task of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny is to act as a watchdog, scrutinising every item of proposed EU legislation, which on average numbers more than 500 documents annually.  It can decide to scrutinise in-depth proposed EU legislation which it considers holds significant implications for Ireland.  This detailed examination of legislation can, where appropriate and necessary, involve detailed discussions with all affected stakeholders, including Ministers, senior officials, interests from industry, business, agriculture and consumer society as well as NGOs.  It also invites the views of the other expert committees within the Oireachtas.  On the basis of those detailed examinations, the joint committee produces timely scrutiny reports which make recommendations to the Government on negotiation positions to be adopted in Brussels.  The reports also act to alert the Oireachtas to any proposal for EU legislation that may have a significant negative impact for Ireland.</P>

	<P>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go bhfuil d&iacute;om&aacute; ar an Aire nach bhfuil s&eacute; in ann a bheith anseo.  T&aacute; cruinni&uacute; aige in &aacute;it &eacute;igin eile.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; liom gurb &eacute; seo an ch&eacute;ad uair &oacute; ainmn&iacute;odh &eacute; mar Aire St&aacute;it nach raibh s&eacute; anseo go pearsanta chun ceisteanna a fhreagairt, so the Deputies opposite are stuck with me.</P>
        <P>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta operates a range of schemes and initiatives to create and maintain employment opportunities and support economic and social development in the Gaeltacht.  On foot of a strategic review carried out by the working group on employment creation in the Gaeltacht, as well as new development strategies adopted by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, significant progress has been made in recent years in reversing the downward employment trend in the Gaeltacht and in effecting a transition from a declining manufacturing sector to employment in the services sector.</P>
        <P>Key sectoral areas of focus for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s include internationally traded services in software, financial services, shared services and customer activities; audiovisual, digital media and ICT; life sciences, including the biomedical and pharmaceutical sectors; aquaculture, fish farming and processing; Irish language-based enterprises; food processing; tourism; and renewable energy.  Particular emphasis has been placed on maximising the potential of indigenous resources, the promotion of new training and educational initiatives, and the provision of third level courses through the medium of Irish in the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>In terms of employment creation, 1,038 new full-time jobs were created in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s-assisted companies in 2007, bringing the total employment figure to 8,026.  This means that for the first time since 2001, more than 8,000 full-time jobs in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s-assisted companies are being supported in the Gaeltacht.  Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, funding of &euro;233 million has been earmarked for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s to continue its work in developing the economy of the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>My Department is in regular contact with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s in a policy and governance context and the job losses to which the Deputy refers are a shared concern.  As the Deputy will be aware, competitiveness in national and international markets has intensified in recent times.  Unsettled financial markets have created difficulties for a number of Gaeltacht companies and others have been placed under pressure due to the euro-dollar exchange rate.  However, the continuing emphasis by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s on after care support will help companies to support job numbers and, in the case of companies that are under market pressure, to keep any job losses at a minimum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2007, the Minister of State tells us, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta created 1,038 jobs.  In the same period, however, 965 jobs were lost in the Gaeltacht, giving a net gain of 73 jobs.  Since then, there have major job losses in Gweedore, Achill and An Daingean in Kerry, with the closure of Contact 4.  The staff of that company in the three locations are owed five to six weeks&rsquo; wages.  They received a telephone call and, one hour later, were out the door and the factories were closed.  This is unacceptable.  Instead of the Department claiming back its grant aid, the focus should be on ensuring that the staff receive their wages.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, is in the United States where he is telling people that for the Irish language to survive in Gaeltacht areas, there must be 250,000 Irish speakers.  What action is being taken by the Department in terms of rolling out the infrastructure needed in Gaeltacht areas?  If industries and workers are to be attracted into Gaeltacht areas, the infrastructure <Col N="68"/>must be in place, including roads, water and sewerage.  Broadband provision is particularly important for business.  What efforts are being made in this regard?</P>
        <P>Is the Department working in conjunction with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to research how more jobs can be created in Gaeltacht areas?  The language will not survive in these areas unless people are attracted to live and work there.  What are the Department&rsquo;s plans to achieve this end?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Any job losses are a matter of serious concern.  I expect the issue of non-payment of wages in the case of the company closure to which the Deputy referred will be processed expeditiously in the normal manner to protect those workers.</P>
        <P>The Department is working with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in a variety of ways to ensure new sectors of employment potential are identified, particularly in the services area.  I am informed that modern services such as customer support centres, community development co-operatives, arts projects, language enterprises and social economy projects as well as child care facilities and so on have been identified.  I take Deputy Ring&rsquo;s point on the provision of broadband and other infrastructure of that nature.  Such provision is extremely important because the survival of many of these service enterprises requires that we facilitate long-term sustainable employment in areas where it has been difficult to do so previously.</P>
        <P>A useful initiative is the co-operation between the National University of Ireland, Galway, with businesses in Gweedore, An Cheathr&uacute; Rua, Carna and Indreabh&aacute;n in regard to the provision of courses through the medium of Irish, with a particular emphasis on areas of study related to the new sectors in which jobs are likely to be available.  The Department is hopeful that these co-operative efforts will enhance long-term sustainable employment prospects in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>As a person who represents three Gaeltacht regions, it sometimes seems that people coming from abroad find it easier than local people to obtain grant aid from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Does the Department plan to introduce a scheme to encourage people from the Gaeltacht to create employment in their own area?</P>
        <P>A recent report indicated that 55% of Gaeltacht areas have broadband but it is ineffective because the signal is not working.  Broadband provision is vital if we hope to attract British, American and other foreign companies into Gaeltacht areas.  It is the way forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is working to increase the provision of broadband throughout the State.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, an allocation of almost &euro;268 million has been made to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta since 2002 to enable it to develop the economy of the Gaeltacht.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s is allowed to reinvest its return from sales of assets in its capital programme.  That has realised &euro;26.5 million for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in recent years.  Working in the context of the national development plan, we are confident that significant progress can be made in creating new job opportunities in Gaeltacht areas.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the progress made with regard to the new programme for rural enterprise development promised in the programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader element of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 represents my Department&rsquo;s response to the commitment in the programme for Government <Col N="69"/>in regard to rural enterprise development.  In that regard, I hope to be in a position to commence the process of selecting the local action groups to deliver the Leader element of the rural development programme in the near future.  The funding available for the delivery of Leader-type activities under the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 will amount to &euro;425.4 million, almost treble the &euro;150 million available for the 2000-2006 period.  The new programme will complement the other funding for rural development measures by my Department.</P>
        <P>In recent years, my Department has pursued a process of cohesion of local delivery structures in order to simplify and enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of a range of local development programmes.  Following extensive consultations with and between the local agencies to develop the most suitable configurations of groups, in the course of 2007, the Government decided on revised areas of coverage for local development groups and clarified the arrangements for the membership of the boards of these bodies.  Leader and partnership groups have been asked to give effect to these decisions and my Department has provided detailed guidelines to secure this outcome.</P>
        <P>The realignment of local delivery structures will reduce the overall number of local development bodies from 94 to 55, comprising 17 partnerships in urban areas and 38 integrated Leader-partnership bodies in rural areas.  My intention is to have the cohesion process completed in advance of the roll-out of the new NDP programmes, including the Leader element of the rural development programme.  At this stage, local development bodies are in place in some 53 of the 55 operational areas agreed by the Government.  The representative networks of Leader and partnership groups, whom I met on 31 January, have assured me that they are fully behind the Government&rsquo;s policy on cohesion and will endeavour to ensure that local delivery structures are in place across the full 55 areas in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In one case, a Leader group has made a complaint to the European Commission regarding the Leader element of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 and, in particular, the cohesion process.  I am satisfied that our approach in this area is fully consistent with the European regulations.  My Department is closely monitoring the position and anticipates a view from the European Commission on this matter in the coming weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke to the Minister of State about some of the questions that were referred from his Department to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but I did not realise that the oral question was also bisected.  In my original question, I asked him if the &euro;150 million community development fund promised in the programme for Government has yet been established, what was the total amount paid out to date from the fund, as well as the total amount paid out in the current year.  However, that was deducted in transit and I hope the Minister of State can look at that as he has done for the other questions that were transferred.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government determined that a number of things would be done to establish a vibrant rural community.  Among those was the establishment of a community and development agency as a one stop shop for advice on grant supports, business opportunities and training and development to manage grant spending under new EU funding for rural development.  It would conduct an enterprise audit to review the use of existing and redundant agricultural buildings and manufacturing plants in rural areas.  In tandem with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Leader programme, agricultural associations, county enterprise boards and rural tourism operators, it would devise a new plan for farm-based rural tourism, including the development of farm-based niche visitor attractions.</P>
        <P>How far advanced is that programme?  There remains much work to be done on the proposals for farmers seeking to use their extra facilities or for rural groups that want to make appli<Col N="70"/>cations.  What has been done so far?  Have any meetings taken place as was suggested in the programme for Government?  Was an enterprise audit carried out?  Is there a one-stop shop in place?  What has been done to implement the major programme to promote rural countryside recreation?  This is one of the questions that I thought was applicable to the Minister of State and I am grateful to him for investigating it.  However, I find it difficult to understand why the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is involved with recreation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Very significant progress has been made in our Department on that issue.  For the questions that were transferred to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I will arrange to have comprehensive replies submitted.  The cohesion process in our area has been significantly advanced.  There are a small number of outstanding matters that need to be resolved, but issues surrounding structures, governance, boundaries and so on have largely been clarified.  There are probably just two outstanding issues.  It may well be that those two issues prove to be more of a hurdle than we had anticipated, but we are confident that soon there will be clarity about where we go next.</P>
        <P>The companies in the process of cohesion can continue the closing down process and carry out accounting exercises, such as the pay-out of grants, from the previous programme.  They will then be able to start the new development programme as soon as matters have been clarified.  I have been informed by the Minister and in my meetings that significant progress can be made shortly.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The function of the Placenames Commission is to advise the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on Irish forms of placenames for legal purposes as provided for in part five of the Official Languages Act 2003, including the placenames of Ireland as they are defined in article 31 of the Act, in order to confirm the Irish forms of those placenames, and preparation of placename orders as provided for in article 32 of the Act; Irish forms of placenames not given in the Act, that is to say street names;  publication and official usage of Irish forms of placenames; development of research and study on placenames in third level institutions and other educational institutions; appropriate marketing on the research of the placenames branch and other matters pertaining to the placenames of Ireland.</P>
        <P>As of July 2003, the commission is appointed for a three-year term.  The current commission was appointed with effect from 10 September 2006 and meets six times a year on average.  Since the enactment of the Official Languages Act 2003, the commission has advised on matters relating to ten placenames orders which have been made under the provisions of the Act.  The commission is supported by the placenames branch of my Department and I will be happy to address further questions the Deputy may have about the work of the branch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of people have contacted me about placenames.  Brian Friel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Translations&rdquo; was one of the best plays he ever produced and hit a chord with people across the country, especially those in rural Ireland.  The commission has been set up for a few years, but not very many counties have been covered.  Are there enough staff in the commission?  The commission is not independently funded, although it should be because this is a very important part of our history.  There is much talk about what is happening to Tara, which is very important in protecting our history.  We have wonderful placenames and much history <Col N="71"/>in local areas, be they rural areas or in cities.  However, we are letting that history go because we are not supporting the Placenames Commission with the funding or the staff to record and save our history.  We are losing our history on a daily basis, especially given what has happened in the past ten years.  It is important that we retain as much of it as we can.</P>
        <P>Could the commission be set up separately?  It could receive a separate budget from the Department and could run its own business, rather than being controlled directly by the Department.  Can more staff be employed to cover every county?  We need to save the history before it is too late.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>We all agree that what the Deputy is saying is an important part of what we do as a nation.  Much work has been done.  The official Irish versions of the placenames of those counties have been recorded in Kilkenny, Louth, Limerick, Monaghan, Waterford, Tipperary and Offaly, as have Gaeltacht areas, centres and districts of population and counties and provinces.  A further order relating to non-administrative names in the Gaeltacht has been prepared by the commission, which will be presented for consideration under the provision of the Act next June, following public consultation.</P>
        <P>The Department established a postgraduate bursary scheme in 2006 in educational institutions and the commission has advised on the awarding of bursaries.  Six of these bursaries have been awarded to date, which will allow postgraduate students to undertake research on placenames in areas of counties Cork, Roscommon, Meath and Westmeath, as well as other aspects of placename studies.  Following further advice from the Commission, the Department is funding a three-year post-doctoral fellowship in NUI Galway to complete research on the placenames of County Mayo.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to hear that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The research will expedite the making of an order for placenames in the county outside Gaeltacht areas, possibly by early 2010.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say that any additional staff that are to be assigned to this area will have to be found from within the Department&rsquo;s allocation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>What funding was spent on the Placenames Commission this year and is there a timeframe for when every county will be completed?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give the Deputy details of the specific funding now, but I can arrange to have them supplied to him.  I gather the date of the last meeting is on the website.

        <Quest> the stage the public consultation process for the new national drugs strategy is at; when and the location where public meetings will be held to develop proposals for a new national drugs strategy to cover the period 2009-16; the number of written submissions that have been received to date; when he expects this process to be concluded; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst><Col N="73"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The steering group for the new national drugs strategy, chaired by my Department, is currently finalising details of a comprehensive public consultation process, which will be undertaken over the coming months.  Consultants, to assist the group in its ongoing work, are also in the process of being recruited and it is expected that they will be on board from next week.</P>
        <P>The steering group has held two meetings to date.  At its second meeting, a broad outline of the consultation process was agreed and it is envisaged that it will comprise the following: a series of 15 public consultation meetings around the country to be undertaken in late April to early June; meetings with the relevant Departments and Government agencies &mdash; it is expected that these meetings will be completed by early June; meetings with key sectoral representatives and organisations, including the community and voluntary sectors; and a series of meetings with appropriate focus groups including, for example, problem drug users, young people at risk and new community groups.</P>
        <P>The steering group is meeting again next Monday when it is expected to sign off on the timetable for the public meetings, which it is envisaged will be held on various dates between 22 April and 3 June.  The times and locations of these meetings will be advertised in the national and local press in the coming weeks once the details have been finalised.  The Deputy should note that I hope to attend as many of the public consultation meetings as possible.  It is envisaged the steering group will meet with the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to hear its views on the new strategy.</P>
        <P>In response to the call for public submissions on the new strategy which was advertised on 26 February, 11 written submissions have been received to date.  However, I expect that number to significantly increase over the coming weeks as I am aware that many organisations are consulting widely with their constituent elements to facilitate comprehensive submissions.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the consultation process being proposed for the new drugs strategy will be very broad and comprehensive.  In all, I expect the process to be completed no later than the end of June or early July.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State say how many consultants will be employed and how money will be spent by the Department?  I want to know how much the consultants will be paid.  I was going to ask the Minister of State to come before our committee and listen to its recommendations as well.  Whatever about the committee, it is very important that the Minister of State, his Department, the steering group and the consultants who are appointed, listen and learn from the last process.  There are many people to be considered, some of whom are happy while others are very dissatisfied as regards the way the money was spent in the last round.  I am hoping that people will be listened to, particularly those who know what is happening on the ground.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is no point in listening to consultants because they are citing recommendations in reports.  We do not need consultants because all they do is move recommendations between one report and another.  We need to talk to people on the ground, the families who are affected and who know what is actually happening.  I hope that much of this money will not be going to consultants but will be spent by people who know what is happening.  How much money will be going to consultants?  How many consultants are being employed?  I am glad to hear the Minister of State is to meet the community groups on the ground because that is where we can learn.</P>
      </Speaker>
     <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>One consultant group will do the lot.  I have had no involvement in this initiative.  Officials within my Department went through the usual process.  I am not yet in a position to say how much is the cost of the consultancy.  It involves not just reviewing the state <Col N="74"/>of the present strategy but listening to what people have to say, in public consultations and so on.  I shall be more than happy to provide the exact figure.  I agree with the Deputy, and I do not want to spend more than is necessary on consultants&rsquo; reports.  Nonetheless, this is a very wide-ranging issue and we need to get it right.  We are talking about a strategy which will stretch from 2009-16.  From talking to groups in the Deputy&rsquo;s part of the country last week, it is clear that issues such as the pervasive problem of alcohol arise regularly.  I am very anxious that the whole issue of alcohol and illegal drugs misuse be incorporated as far as possible into the one strategy.  Listening to groups I meet with, I believe they are amenable to that approach.  I am very anxious to have detailed consultation with Members of the Oireachtas because their insight is not available elsewhere.  I am anxious to engage in such consultation before the summer break.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister of State will go abroad to see what is happening in other countries because it is important that we learn from them.  I hope the group will go abroad and that we will learn how the United Kingdom and other European countries are dealing with the problem.</P>
        <P>A cross-party committee was set up to consider the abuse of alcohol and its sale in shops and off-licences and a report was given to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  When will the report be published and will it come before the committee for discussion in order to determine what can be done to curb the over-supply and abuse of alcohol?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of examining what is happening in other jurisdictions, the eight Administrations participating in the British-Irish Council met in Kilmainham a few weeks ago and discussed drugs and alcohol.  I was in Copenhagen and Helsinki prior to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and met a number of organisations involved in combating the misuse of drugs and alcohol.  Ireland is probably as good as, if not better than, some jurisdictions in this regard.</P>
        <P>I understand the report on alcohol has been given to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Preparations are being made to draft legislation.  I will inquire from the Minister as to when it is likely to be published.</P>

        <Quest> the breakdown of his Departmental staff; the location of each of the offices of his Department and the number of staff based in each; the number attached to each Minister or Minister of State within his Department in regard to private office and constituency office; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The total staff complement for my Department is 269.  The breakdown of staff by location is as follows: Dublin, 119; Tubbercurry, 79; Galway, 58; and other locations, including Donegal, Athlone and Cavan, 13.  A total of 15 staff are assigned to the Minister, including ten in the private office and five in the constituency office.  A total of 7.4 staff are assigned to my office, including 3.6 in the private office and 3.8 in the constituency office.  Two civilian drivers are also assigned to me as Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>On the decentralisation of the Department, what is the position on Tubbercurry <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the move to Knock?  How many existing staff have agreed to move to Knock? <Col N="75"/> What is the cost of leasing the premises in Tubbercurry?  If the premises on Mespil Road is leased by the Department, what does it cost?</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind that Deputy Ring is from Mayo, we must all be pragmatic.  It beggars belief how we will create transport links between Dublin and the locations of the decentralised staff.  Knock has an airport but does not have a railway station, the nearest of which is in Claremorris.  Bus and taxi transport must be factored into the cost.  Is it realistic to decentralise staff to Knock as a consequence?  Newbridge in my county is on a rail line and there is, therefore, logic to decentralising staff there, but I cannot see the logic in transferring staff to Knock.  The transport problems associated with Tubbercurry must be causing major problems in the Department in terms of ensuring continuity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>On decentralisation generally, the Office of Public Works, on behalf of the Department, will shortly be applying for planning permission for a new site in Charlestown in County Mayo.  The staff currently located in Tubbercurry will relocate to that premises on its completion, which will be in 2010, all going well.</P>
        <P>Non-property costs mentioned over the period 2004 to 2007 cover ICT and logistical support.  The main costs of the Office of Public Works include the cost of the original site at the airport at Knock, that is, &euro;390,000, and the rental and fit-out costs at Tubbercurry and Na Forbacha.  It is expected that the additional costs will be a fraction of those incurred to date.  At this stage, the Department is not in a position to be more specific.</P>
        <P>Of the 144 posts to be relocated to Charlestown, 79 have been assigned to temporary offices in Tubbercurry as a precursor to the move to the new headquarters, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2010.  The Tubbercurry offices opened in July 2006.  Additional temporary accommodation is now being refurbished in Tubbercurry to allow us to further advance the decentralisation programme.  From mid-May, over 100 staff will be relocated there, that is, some 74% of the original target.  All ten posts to be relocated to Na Forbacha are now assigned.  On Pobal, 42 posts have been moved to temporary offices in Clifden.  The full complement will be relocated when Pobal&rsquo;s permanent offices are completed in Clifden, which is expected in 2009.  The Office of Public Works has identified a suitable site there.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>If we could have the western rail corridor extended to Charlestown, it would make a massive difference to employees being located there.  I read in the local press that the site has been bought in Charlestown.  Can the Minister of State confirm this?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Progress has been a little slower in respect of Foras na Gaeilge.  Partly due to the fact that it is a North-South implementation body, it was necessary to secure the agreement of our Northern counterparts to the move.  However, we now hope to see the start of the relocation process later this year, with possibly up to 20%, or just seven, of the targeted posts earmarked for relocation.  The building owned by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in Gaoth Dobhair is available for the staff of Foras na Gaeilge.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 18 together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to a priority question on a related issue earlier today and to my previous replies to Question Nos. 10 and 19 of 14 February 2008.</P>
        <P>As indicated in those replies, I hope to be in a position to commence the process of selecting the local action groups to deliver the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2007-2013 in the near future.  The funding available for the delivery of LEADER-type activities under the Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2007-2013 will amount to &euro;425.4 million &mdash; almost treble the &euro;150 million available for the 2000-06 period.  The new programme will complement the other funding for rural development measures by my Department.</P>
        <P>On the local development social inclusion programme, the position is that the National Development Plan 2007-2013 commits &euro;49.6 billion to social inclusion including some &euro;417 million for the local development and social inclusion programme, LDSIP.  The 2008 voted allocation for the LDSIP is &euro;57.44 million.  Transitional arrangements are in place for 2008 to enable the new integrated structures and partnerships to extend their areas of coverage and to embed their operations.  A value for money review of the programme is currently being concluded.  My intention is to use the findings from this review to shape the future programme.</P>
        <P>As indicated to the House earlier today, my intention is to have the cohesion process completed in advance of the roll-out of the new national development programmes, including the Leader programme and the local development social inclusion programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Have there been any job losses or lay-offs due to the delay in rolling out the Leader programme?  I support a Minister conducting a review of the previous prog<Col N="77"/>rammes and if there were any negatives in them, I would support a Minister if he or she had to correct that.  What I cannot support is that while we knew this was coming and that there would be a new Leader programme, we have buildings and staff all over this country and the Leader programme has not yet been rolled out.  It does not make sense for the Government to pay staff if the Leader programme is not being rolled out.  I want to see that programme rolled out as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Could the Minister of State provide an update on what has happened to the complaint relating to the Leader company in Cavan that was made to Europe?  What is the problem, what is the complaint and is this holding back the roll out of the Leader programme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Letters have been exchanged between the parties &mdash; between legal representatives for the companies involved and the European Commission and our Department.  Correspondence was received by our Department a number of weeks ago.  That most recent correspondence from the Commission has been responded to and we in the Department are waiting for the Commission&rsquo;s response to it.  Our Department is confident that the position it has taken on the cohesion process will be vindicated but we await the outcome of that.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, as I stated earlier and in my reply, the cohesion companies are in a position to wind up and complete existing programmes which had been in place under the current national development plan and we believe that it will be possible to roll out the new programme fairly expeditiously once this issue has been resolved.</P>
        <P>On loss of jobs or redeployment, as each company is a separate company it is largely in the hands of those companies.  It would be naive to suggest that there would not be at least some redundancies involved but it is too early to say yet what the extent of those will be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

	<P>It has been concluded.  I am satisfied that my officials will make arrangements for the publication and dissemination of the report in a manner that will be consistent with the value for money policy review guidelines issued by the Department of Finance.  I am given to understand it will be available quite shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Last February, I launched the national awareness campaign on drugs, &ldquo;The Party&rsquo;s Over&rdquo;.  This campaign was developed by the Health Service Executive, HSE, in consultation with many of the key Departments and agencies involved in tackling problem drug use, including my Department.</P>
        <P>The campaign was developed with the intention that it will be sustainable over the next three years.  In the first phase, the primary aim is to communicate the dangers of cocaine use, with a particular focus on so-called recreational cocaine users in the 15-34 year age group.  The campaign is utilising appropriate media, such as social network websites, billboard and bus advertising as well as radio advertising to target this age group, and this approach will be continued.</P>
        <P>The health promotion unit of the HSE has also published two leaflets &ldquo;Know The Facts About Drugs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cocaine &mdash; the Facts&rdquo; to accompany the campaign.  A drugs information website <i>www.drugs.ie</i> has also been developed and launched in conjunction with the campaign.</P><Col N="78"/>
        <P>In this context, it is worth noting that many of the local and regional drugs task forces already have in place a number of valuable initiatives, including events such as awareness weeks.  Such initiatives have proven to be effective as many of them focus on issues that are particular to their localities.</P>
        <P>In addition, it should be noted that I have secured funding this year for initiatives to tackle the cocaine problem.  As part of this, cocaine awareness campaigns at a more local and regional level &mdash; to dovetail with this national campaign &mdash; will be developed over the coming months by the drugs task forces.  In the past two weeks we called for local campaign proposals to be forwarded, through task forces, to me.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>How much exactly did &ldquo;The Party&rsquo;s Over&rdquo; campaign cost?  Although I do not like saying so, I was disappointed with the advertisements.  At a time when there was never as much talk about drugs, we never had as many crises about drugs and we never had as many people dying from drugs, the campaign was too light.  I thought that we would have a campaign such as that for drink driving in which there would be a positive effect where people would see what happens.</P>
        <P>It is one thing to have an awareness campaign, but it must be effective and I felt that this campaign was not.  I want to know how much we paid for it.  Personally, I was disappointed with the way that this was rolled out.  I would hope that future campaigns will be more striking and convincing and get the message across.</P>
        <P>Is this campaign being brought to the schools, to the colleges and onto the streets with public meetings?  It is far more effective to bring it into the schools and to the colleges and to call public meetings to show what is happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The sum of &euro;600,000 was set aside by the HSE for the campaign.  The campaign was developed arising from an evaluation of the previous campaigns which were found to be less than effective because they were not focused enough, etc.  I am advised that the deficiencies, such as they were, in the previous campaigns were taken account of.  The HSE, along with our Department, will be carrying out an evaluation of the campaign.</P>
        <P>One must bear in mind that the campaign, both local and national, will run for a three-year period.  The local campaigns, which will involve long-term interventions as well as simply advertising awareness, will cost of the order of &euro;2 million over the next three years.  Separately, the Department of Education and Science and other agencies are working on awareness campaigns.</P>
        <P>As to whether they are hard-hitting enough, I would not disagree with Deputy Ring.  For example, one music magazine, which I will not name but which most people will know, produced a good specific issue on the drug culture.  It submitted to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and to RTE what I regarded as a hard-hitting, but not offensive, advertising DVD which in both cases, I understand, was ruled to be in poor taste, and only a much more modified version of the advertisement was allowed to be broadcast.  Sometimes it is extremely difficult to gauge how hard-hitting one can be.</P>
        <P>I note Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh is here.  He and I were at a seminar this morning organised by Merchants Quay Ireland where a publication on needle exchange programmes was launched which, in itself, is hard-hitting and will probably be disturbing.  No doubt certain persons will find it necessary to complain about how blunt are the messages in that booklet.  Frankly, we cannot have it both ways.  We either get the message across clearly and bluntly, or we can pussyfoot around for ever and not be able to tackle the problem.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="79"/>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The war against drugs will only be won if families can be linked into tackling societal problems regarding drug barons etc.  I fully support Deputy Ring&rsquo;s comments that initiatives such as this must be directed towards primary and secondary school pupils and developed subsequently through the children&rsquo;s parents.  What will be done in this regard?  Moreover, during Question Time and in committee meetings on previous occasions, I raised with the Minister of State the use of national sport and recreation organisations.  In tandem with parents, such organisations should be used to demonstrate alternatives, to show the enjoyment people can derive from activities that are not associated with drugs and that another world is there for young people that is highly entertaining and enjoyable.  The Minister should try to ascertain how young people can be directed towards such activities because repeatedly hitting them with a constant barrage in this regard simply becomes repetitive and does not provide the involvement that people seek.</P>
        <P>I recall holding a meeting in Athy on drug misuse that parents simply did not wish to attend.  They did not want it known that they had attended such a meeting.  People have fears in this regard and members of the Garda have confirmed this to me.  They stated that people are wary of attending such meetings because were they to be seen, people might think that someone belonging to them was involved with drugs.  The Minister of State should indicate ways in which he can use the more than 1,000 recreational associations in Ireland to provide alternatives to young people, involving families, which will make the difference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I completely agree with Deputy Wall.  The practice in most recovery programmes now is that families are involved in the entire process from the time the misuser engages with the service right through the continuum of care.  The Deputy probably is aware of the family support network, of which there are 150 to 180 units in different parts of the country that carry out very good work.  Last Friday I visited Limerick and sat in on a training programme that was being carried out there by the Strengthening Families programme, which is an American-based programme from the University of Utah.  It is being rolled out in 18 different counties, mainly through the national youth organisations that are partially funded by the Department.  I also am anxious to engage with the sports bodies.  As the Deputy probably is aware, some sports development offices are co-funded by the Department and local authorities, as well as by the sports bodies, which are carrying out extremely good work in the preventative area.  For example, last Thursday I launched what I consider to be an extremely effective campaign by Galway United Football Club called Give Drugs the Boot.  Unfortunately, the club appears to have given the manager the boot the next day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>It has.  Unfortunately, he was unable to be present that evening.</P>
        <P>To be serious, the club, which is grounded in the community, is going around different parts of Galway and its hinterland holding a premiership-type fun event.  It will engage people in that fashion.  Its players and supporters are involved and the business community also is closely involved in driving the programme.  Furthermore, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, held a meeting earlier today with the GAA pertaining to the alcohol issue, a field in which I believe there is considerable room for co-operation between various Departments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>On the point made by the Minister of State, Members should praise all those groups that have taken the initiative.  While some have done so of their own volition, money should be available to others to allow them to organise awareness campaigns.  Although the Minister announced &euro;2 million in funding for awareness campaigns, I believe this merely constitutes a drop in the ocean.  What steps has he taken to ensure the sourcing of more money to gain access to schools, sports clubs, social venues and professional bodies with material that is relevant to them?  There should be shock tactics, if necessary, in advertisements and the like.  What additional money is available?  Although the &euro;2 million allocated by the Minister of State probably has already been committed, if this programme is to be rolled out over three years, a continuous campaign will be required.  How will the Minister do that?  The message will remain the same but it must be continually changed and revised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The awareness campaign is an integral part of the national drug strategy and constitutes one of its five pillars.  I am determined to continue to fund initiatives.  The sum of &euro;2 million is intended for local awareness campaigns and I await the submission of proposals from all parts of the country.  I expect they will be highly innovative and a number of groups have spoken to me in this regard.  It is not always down to cost as effectiveness probably is as important.  Certainly however, money will be available in the area of cocaine in particular.  Moreover, the area of poly-drug use is developing because Irish people appear to be interested in mixing their drugs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 16, 17, 38 and 148 together.</P>
        <P>As I informed the House earlier in response to today&rsquo;s Priority Question No. 4, the Government decided to establish a Cabinet-level committee to consider matters arising in the context <Col N="81"/>of the analysis and recommendations of the report on the linguistic study of the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht.  The first meeting of the committee is scheduled to take place on 10 April 2008.  Accordingly, no decisions have been taken at this point with regard to the Gaeltacht boundaries or electoral areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to hear this because the report on the linguistic study on the Irish language makes recommendations whereby categories A, B and C will be introduced.  There are three Gaeltacht areas in my constituency of Mayo and the adoption of the report by the Government would mean that only Ceathr&uacute; Thaidhg would be included in any of the aforementioned categories.  While I was anxious to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views in this regard today, he is not present and I will table another question on this matter again.  Were such recommendations carried through, Belmullet, Tourmakeady and parts of Achill Island in my constituency, and County Meath would not have any representation at the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s, which would be a serious mistake.  Members should have a debate in this House and in committee regarding any changes that might take place that would affect the representation of communities at the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>As I noted earlier, no decisions have been taken with regard to the Gaeltacht boundaries.  Deputy Ring&rsquo;s suggestions may constitute a useful way forward.  As the Cabinet committee meets and develops its approach, one will be able to engage further in how it will be possible to implement some of the suggestions put forward by Deputy Ring and others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>It has taken quite some time to hold the first meeting of the Cabinet committee on the staid&eacute;ar teangeola&iacute;och.  If there are to be boundary changes for the Gaeltacht, would it require legislation?  Can Members anticipate the application of greater urgency in respect of the scrutiny by the Cabinet committee of the analysis and recommendations in the report?  This is typical of how matters are handled in the Department in that it goes on and on, decisions are not made and a deteriorating situation becomes worse.  My essential question is whether Members can have confidence that the Minister will ensure the recommendations of this study are implemented at some reasonable date and will not run on into the life of the next Government, which is highly likely.  I do not envisage any situation arising in which there will be boundary changes before the next &Uacute;dar&aacute;s elections.  Indeed, if there are to be changes regarding the boundaries, that will require other legislation.  There is a great deal of technical and legislative work to be done.  There is absolutely no urgency about this.  The setting up of this Cabinet-level committee is really an example of tokenism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I completely reject the assertion that this is tokenism.  Anybody who knows the Minister knows that whatever else one might say about him, he is not involved in token gestures.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Shea noted, one of the recommendations is that certain electoral districts be redrawn with a view to combining townlands and so on, including existing Irish-speaking networks, with adjacent electoral divisions of the same linguistic profile.  Obviously, this has a knock-on effect on other legislation.  Due to the fact the Cabinet-level committee is high-powered, it is clear that it will be in a position to progress the recommendations, findings and a programme of action which is necessary and that the Government is committed to it.</P>

It is proposed that the feedback from those sessions will be available to the committee to assist in its deliberations.  I have no doubt the Cabinet-level committee, as happens with all such committees, will meet as and when it is necessary.  I imagine the Minister will be insistent that it meets quite regularly. </P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
<P>Arising from the joint ministerial initiative on the review of local and community development structures, the Government agreed a series of measures in January 2004 to improve arrangements under which community and local development initiatives are delivered and to improve cohesion and focus across various measures.  This process is informed by the following guiding principles: improving on the ground services; streamlining structures so as to avoid overlaps, duplication and undue administrative overheads; bringing transparency, co-ordination and improved control to the funding and operation of local and community development <Col N="83"/>measures; and strengthening the democratic accountability of agencies and providers in this area.</P>
        <P>The core objective of the process is to simplify and improve local delivery of programmes operated by my Department through the integration and alignment of local delivery structures.  In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, the intention is that for the future, there will be one local development company in any given area and fewer local development companies overall.  The new arrangements will provide full county coverage and enable communities to more readily access services and make maximum use of the funding available.</P>
        <P>Following an extensive consultation phase, the Government decided on revised areas of coverage for local development groups and clarified the arrangements in respect of the membership of the boards of these bodies last year.  Leader and partnership groups have been asked to give effect to these decisions and my Department has provided detailed guidelines to secure this outcome.  The realignment of local delivery structures will reduce the overall number of local development bodies from 94 to 55, comprising 17 partnerships in urban areas and 38 integrated Leader-partnership bodies in rural areas.</P>
        <P>My intention is to have the cohesion process completed in advance of the roll out of the new NDP programmes, including the Leader programme and the local development social inclusion programme.  At this stage, local development bodies are in place in 53 of the 55 operational areas agreed by the Government.  In respect of the islands, a new integrated structure was incorporated on 8 November 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The one stop shop approach certainly works in respect of the sports partnerships in the specific areas where they set out workshops in respect of providing information and setting up programmes where they work with the various sports groups to ensure the application for national lottery funding is right and proper and within the guidelines.</P>
        <P>I do not see anything of that in respect of either the outgoing Leader programmes or the new process.  The programme for Government contains exciting things relating to creating a vibrant rural community in respect of agriculture and agri-tourism.  However, I see nothing that invites the people in.  There has been a complete change in respect of many agri-businesses in rural Ireland and nothing seems to be coming on stream that will attract them.  We talk about Leader, changes and the realignment of the system but nothing seems to be coming forward that will suddenly tell rural areas that we are now going to have a vibrant community, involve everybody, have a tourism value that will attract people to our area, use some of the facilities that farmers have and see mechanisms that will make it easy for this to happen.  That does not seem to be there.  Does the Minister of State believe that this is or will be there?  Where do we stand in respect of the vibrant rural community that was envisaged in the programme for Government before the last election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The rural development programme will be delivered very much at local level.  It is there and significant funding is assigned to it.  For example, &euro;16.66 million has been assigned for diversification into non-agricultural activities for farm families.  A total of &euro;48.26 million has been assigned to support business creation and development, while &euro;45.4 million has been assigned to encourage tourism activities.  Over &euro;49 million has been assigned for basic services for the economy and rural population, &euro;54.2 million has been assigned for village renewal and development, &euro;51.7 million has been assigned for conservation and upgrading of the rural heritage, &euro;29.45 million has been assigned for training and information on adapted and new skills, nearly &euro;11 million has been assigned for implementing co-operation projects and &euro;34.63 million has been assigned for skills acquisition and animation.</P><Col N="84"/>
        <P>Through the local structures, which we are very close to seeing put in place, it will take very little time before we see a roll-out of very significant and interesting projects.  Last week, I had an opportunity in Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Clare to look at some really interesting projects that have added hugely to what Deputy Wall describes as the vibrant rural communities.  I am extremely hopeful and have a high level of expectation that we will see a considerable amount of high-quality development in the very near future once the programme begins to be rolled out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State was very welcome in Mayo last week but it is a pity he did not tell me he was coming as I would have met him.  A new Fianna F&aacute;il policy over the past few years has been not to tell anybody that they are coming in.  The only time we are told about a public meeting is when there is trouble.  We are brought in to deal with the problem.  I was glad to see the Minister of State&rsquo;s photograph in the local newspaper.  I would have liked to have been with there with him but it did not happen.  Something needs to be done about the one stop shop as Deputy Wall has outlined very well.  We have many agencies in different counties.  When people come to a particular agency for information they are told that it only deals with one area and not others.  Many people do not understand about agencies and believe they are all the one.  They feel they are getting the run around.  It is important that we have the one-stop shops so that when people come into a building they can get the information in that office regardless of the information sought and they do not need to go down the street.  They do not understand the difference between them.</P>
        <P>My next question relates to the islands.  We talk about the Irish language, rural areas and communities.  I must say that the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, has supported the islands over the years.  The islands should be given their own Leader programme in the next round.  It is important that they be given that recognition and support.  That grant aid should be available for them to try to get more people involved in the islands to create employment and get rural development up and running in the islands.  In recent years the islands have issued a number of reports and it is important that the Leader programme should include them.  I hope the islands will be treated independently of the Leader programmes on the mainland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that it is very important that a structure exists to support the islands.</P>
        <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputies that the sooner we get the one-stop shops in place the better.  Some of the Deputy&rsquo;s county council colleagues were in Kiltimagh, which is an extremely good example of a one-stop shop.  I was very impressed by the range of activities that were being delivered through, in this case, the Kiltimagh community development project.  They ranged from early education right through to senior citizens.  There was a wide range of activities in the area of computers.  I met some young people involved in the For&oacute;ige club for example.  Active retired people were also there.  There is a greater willingness in rural parts or outside the large urban areas for that to happen than there is in large city areas.  If necessary, we must continue to encourage and knock heads together.  At the end of the day customer service is what matters.  The Deputy is right.  People expect to be able to get the information they seek in one location rather than going from one office to another.  There is no justification for the dispersal of information that has been the practice up to now.  The cohesion process will contribute towards that happening.</P>

	<P>In my area we have the county council, Naas Town Council and the local VEC.  Regarding the one-stop shops, it is wonderful to see the move towards local authority buildings that can encompass many of these things.  In the long term I hope we will see one-<Col N="85"/>stop shops becoming part and parcel of that.  The central focus of any town is on the local authority buildings and some magnificent buildings have been built.  Without predetermining some of the initiatives and schemes, would it be possible to use the local authority mechanism to introduce another strand that would be helpful to all organisations that need to deal with local authorities?</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter, which relates to the withdrawal of respite care from patients in the Cherry Orchard Hospital in Ballyfermot, which is a very retrograde step.  A number of constituents have contacted me on the matter.  The rollover respite is being cut from May.  The 24 places that were available will be cut back to 12.  There is a fear that the other respite that is available might also be cut.  Everything about this flies in the face of common sense.  If respite is not available a number of elderly people will end up in accident and emergency units and ultimately in acute beds in hospitals thereby taking up more valuable space and time.  As it is, families and carers are just about able to manage.  To a certain extent their sanity depends on the availability of this respite.  One of my constituents cares for her 84 year old mother who has Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  She said it is like minding a baby 24 hours a day seven days a week.  The only break she gets is through the respite that is available.</P><Col N="86"/>
        <P>In 2007 the Cherry Orchard Hospital opened two new respite wards which were very welcome.  However, that facility has now been cut in half which flies in the face of common sense.  This facility that had been expanded with all the capital expense of providing additional beds and now it does not have the backup to provide the respite.  I have written to the general manager and received a reply indicating that it would review it based on budgetary concerns etc.  The budget should be made available to provide this service for the patients in Cherry Orchard.  In addition to the cutting of the respite beds, which is the primary concern, home help is also being cut so it is a double whammy and people are being hit twice.  I ask the Minister to review the situation regarding the Cherry Orchard Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>In my constituency the same issue has arisen because some of my constituents also avail of respite care in Cherry Orchard Hospital.  For example, a constituent contacted me regarding his 91 year old father, who lives with the family of one of his children and is cared for on a full-time basis.  He is extremely feeble and needs full-time care.  Members of the family need to carry him up and down the stairs each day.  The one lifesaver for the family has been that every few weeks they get a few days respite care in Cherry Orchard Hospital.  They recently got a phone call from the HSE advising that this service would be discontinued from the end of May until there is a change regarding the budget.</P>
        <P>A recent report in <i>The Irish Times</i> indicated that 24 families are similarly affected.  As Deputy Upton has said the people affected by this have very high needs and are extremely vulnerable.  They could end up in long-term hospital care if something goes wrong.  It is putting severe strain on their families who have other issues to deal with.  The family I am talking about has other family members who are sick and the issue is causing them considerable stress.  They are willing to care for their parent at home and are saving the State considerable money &mdash; probably at least &euro;1,000 per week.  This and other cutbacks by the HSE are hitting the most vulnerable people of all.  It is vital for the Minister to make alternative arrangements or else ensure the 12 beds in Cherry Orchard Hospital are immediately reopened.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Deputies for raising the issue as it provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to services for older people generally and, in particular, the important area of providing day and respite care.</P>
        <P>Government policy on older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016<i>.</i></P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s objective of continued development of community-based services for older persons is reflected in the funding given to the system in recent times.  In the budgets of 2006 and 2007, more than &euro;400 million was provided to enhance service developments across the sector, of which just over &euro;190 million was for community-based services over these two years.</P>
        <P>Arising from the budget of 2008, a full-year package of &euro;22 million has been allocated for new services in the area of older people.  This gives a total of more than &euro;422 million for new services for older people over the last three years.  These measures have been designed to both enhance existing services that the Government had already put in place and to widen the range of services available to older people.</P><Col N="87"/>
        <P>In this context, over &euro;16 million has been provided in the last three years for new day and respite care services.  The recent budget will allow an additional 1,245 clients nationally to avail of new respite places and brings the total projected day care provision to approximately 21,300 places by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The HSE is committed, through the national service plan 2008, to delivering services within its Vote provided by the Oireachtas.  It will manage the provision of respite care beds at Cherry Orchard within this context, while also recognising the priority the Government and the Executive have given to services for older people.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that demand can at times exceed service resources and that this problem can manifest itself at local level such as the particular pressures being experienced at Cherry Orchard.  However, it is a matter for the HSE to deliver services both nationally and locally within its budget and overall health policy priorities.  I understand that, in this particular case, the executive will continue to keep the matter under close review.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office for allowing me the opportunity to raise this issue, which I have raised previously by way of parliamentary question and on the Adjournment but it has not been resolved as of yet.  This relates to a young woman who arrived in this country some years ago, with her husband, on foot of a work permit.  Unfortunately, over the years her circumstances have changed dramatically for the worse whereby she now finds herself, after a very acrimonious separation procedure, separated, alone and homeless.  </P>
        <P>Again and again, the response I receive to queries regarding rent support is that she previously made an application which was refused by the HSE but she did not appeal.  What are the chances of her appeal being successful?  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Wall, will be familiar with the HSE appeals process relating to supplementary allowances.  I am quite sure that the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, is also familiar with the procedure.  I am very familiar with it, from my days in the former health board and I have yet to find a person who was successful in his or her appeal.  I have never met even one such person.  It is said that up to 20% of appeals are successful but unfortunately I am still waiting to meet the first  person whose appeal was successful.</P>
        <P>Ironically, a parliamentary question is regarded by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and by the HSE, in such circumstances, as equal to an appeal.  A D&aacute;il question triggers an appeal and the case is automatically examined.  One way or another, the person concerned has had growing rent arrears for the past six months and nothing has been paid.  The only help she has received was from the local branch of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which is adamant that this is a most pressing and urgent case that requires assistance.</P>
        <P>The other excuse that has been used to refuse rent supplement is that the local authority has not ratified her need for rehousing.  Why has it not done so?  The reason given is that she does not have stamp four status.  What a load of codswallop.  I have never heard anything like it in my life.  The person is homeless.  She has two children who are attending local schools, is being supported by voluntary organisations and was previously in receipt of rent support from the HSE at a different address.  When she moved to her current address, the community welfare officer in that area obviously had a different view of the case.  While I do not want to create problems for individual officers outside this House I wish to make it quite clear that it is not acceptable that individuals make decisions which are particularly punitive and impact in the way that this decision has impacted on the woman in question, as of now.</P><Col N="88"/>
        <P>I can anticipate the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply and could write the script for him.  Indeed, he knows I could write the script for him, before he ever reads it.  As a practising politician himself, Deputy Carey will understand the frustration of Members of the House in situations such as this.  I ask him to reach down through the system and find out the individual or the blockage that is causing the problem and resolve it.  This issue is not going to go away and I have every intention of raising it again and, if necessary, to raise a complaint about the way it has been handled by the individual officer concerned.  I will not accept it.  There is further information available which I do not wish to put on the record of the House at this particular time, but I will do so in the future if I have to.  I wish to make that quite clear.  I will leave it to the Minister of State to use his good judgment, courage and initiative to take this problem by the scruff of the neck and resolve it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Martin Cullen.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on the Minister&rsquo;s behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Eligibility is in general confined to those who are in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.  There are currently over 61,000 tenants benefiting from assistance under the rent supplement scheme.  In order to qualify for a rent supplement a person must be a <i>bona fide</i> tenant; satisfy the Health Service Executive that he or she has a housing need which he or she cannot meet from his or her own resources; apply to the local housing authority for an assessment of housing needs if requested to do so by the Health Service Executive; be habitually resident in the State; and satisfy the general conditions of entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
        <P>Where a person is referred to a housing authority by the HSE, the housing authority is asked to determine if the person has a housing need and to make a recommendation accordingly.  When the housing authority has completed the assessment for rent supplement purposes, it notifies the local community welfare officer of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that rent supplement was paid for the period December 2004 to November 2005 in respect of the household of which the person concerned was a member.  Following separation from her husband, the Health Service Executive issued an exceptional needs payment of &euro;847 in August 2006 to the person concerned to assist with the payment of rent arrears.  This payment was issued pending verification of a number of issues that would have a bearing on her rent supplement entitlement.</P>
        <P>The executive has advised that the person concerned first submitted an application for rent supplement in her own right in respect of her previous residence in November 2006.  The person concerned was advised in writing on 14 December 2006 of the executive&rsquo;s decision to refuse payment of rent supplement on the grounds that the local housing authority considered that she did not have a housing need in accordance with section 9 of the Housing Act 1988.</P>
        <P>The executive has further advised that on 28 February 2008, it exercised its discretion and issued an exceptional needs payment of &euro;5,052 directly to the landlord of the previous address of the person concerned in respect of the months from April 2007 to October 2007.  The executive has advised that the payment was issued in respect of arrears of rent due and was issued without prejudice to the status of the rent supplement entitlement of the person concerned.</P><Col N="89"/>
        <P>The executive has advised that it has not received a formal application for rent supplement from the person concerned in respect of her current residence.  It has further advised that it has not received an appeal from the person concerned against the decision not to award a rent supplement in respect of the previous residence.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person concerned to appeal any decision made by a community welfare officer in respect of her rent supplement entitlement.  The person concerned should make a formal application for rent supplement in respect of her current residence so that a decision on her entitlement can be formally determined.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Kilbarrack Foxfield St. John Parish is one of two parishes of the historic district of Kilbarrack in the centre of my constituency.  Over 25 years ago the then President Erskine Childers laid the foundation stone for the Kilbarrack Foxfield community centre on Greendale Road and a number of very committed local groups amalgamated to form the Kilbarrack and District Community Association, KADCA, to successfully run the centre in the intervening quarter of a century.  Over that long period, there have been major changes in Kilbarrack but there has always been an outstanding need for the provision of recreation and sport for the young people of the parish.  Our great GAA club, Naomh Barr&oacute;g, and the local football club, Kilbarrack United, have performed Trojan work over the years for the youth of the area but it is only in very recent years that both these fine clubs have received significant State support.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Kilbarrack Community Programme was established in the early 1990s when a group of local community activists came together to form the Kilbarrack Community Families Against Drugs, which vigorously opposed the sale of heroin in the area by criminal elements.  With the help of the Eastern Health Board, F&Aacute;S and the then Minister of State, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, a Kilbarrack after care community programme was developed from May 1996 and finally established in later 1998.  In January 2001, at the request of its clients, the programme&rsquo;s name was changed to the current Kilbarrack Coast Community Programme, KCCP.  Over the past decade, KCCP has provided rehabilitation, care and training to young citizens recovering from drug misuse and addiction.  As a strong deterrence to prevent youngsters becoming involved in or addicted to drugs, KCCP established a vibrant youth programme, Youth Matters, eight years ago.  This body provides sporting recreational and educational activities for the nine to 18 year old age group.  From its beginning, KCCP has also had an active parents support group to provide counselling and support to the parents of drug misusers.</P>
        <P>Over the past few years, KCCP has worked closely with the Kilbarrack Foxfield regeneration campaign in its aim to transform the parish area by planning to build a new youth and community resource centre.  It is envisaged approximately one third of the area of the centre will be given over to KCCP&rsquo;s core programmes to eliminate drug misuse in our community.  Recently, I met a widely representative local committee, elected after a well attended public meeting last October, who wished to report to Oireachtas colleagues, the HSE and myself on the campaign for the new youth and recreation centre.  One of the committee members, Superintendent <Col N="90"/>Michael Finn, a distinguished former garda who has given more than 12 years voluntary service to the Kilbarrack community, outlined how 1,500 households in the parish had been contacted and indicated support for the projects and how the wonderful Le Ch&eacute;ile community and youth building in Donnycarney might be used as a model for Kilbarrack Foxfield.  Other committee members spoke of meetings with Deputy Lord Mayor of Dublin, Anne Carter, the Minister of State &mdash; I commend for his interest in this matter &mdash; and the Dublin North East drugs task force and the national drugs strategy team, where detailed presentations were made.</P>
        <P>During the previous D&aacute;il, the then Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and his senior civil servant, Mr. Padraig Stanley, investigated the strong case for the new centre made by KCCP and a wide variety of local sporting and social clubs.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs asked that a structure be developed to show the various community and recreational bodies in Kilbarrack Foxfield were prepared to work together to develop a facility under community control, open to all sections of the community.  I strongly support that aim.  This process is well advanced and the ball is, therefore, in the Minister of State&rsquo;s court.  With goodwill all around and support throughout Kilbarrack Foxfield and the broader Kilbarrack area, the Minister of State and his funding agencies should begin detailed final planning and preparation for tendering on a greatly needed new youth and community building for Kilbarrack Foxfield St. John, all its citizens and, especially, the children, teenagers and young adults.  The Minister of State is welcome in Kilbarrack any time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter, with which I am becoming more familiar.  I also thank him for the initiatives he has taken together with Councillor Carter and the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  This issue has proved difficult to resolve for a long time.  I am extremely anxious to engage with the group over the next number of weeks to reach a conclusion because the next round of applications for funding under the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund is due.  This is the vehicle through which projects such as this can be delivered.  I am well aware of the needs of Kilbarrack because I was involved in youth work in the area many years ago.  It is a vibrant community.  This issue was divisive previously but a great deal of common ground has been found and I will undertake with my officials to engage with the Deputy over the next two weeks in order that we can come to a solution to the problem.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy said, the Le Ch&eacute;ile project in Donnycarney could be used as a model and it is probably what Kilbarrack needs.  Now that we are embarking on the next phase of the national drugs strategy, which is public consultation, the issues of drug misuse and polydrug use are as important to be addressed in Kilbarrack as everywhere else.  We must also invest in prevention and harm reduction because prevention is better than cure.  Earlier I attended the launch of an awareness programme by the Merchants Quay Project together with Deputies Rabbitte, &Oacute; Snodaigh and a number of others, which focuses on needle exchange and harm reduction.  Every community must come to grips with the challenge it faces and Kilbarrack has done its share in that regard.  I will communicate with Deputy Broughan in the coming week and I undertake to sit down with my officials to find a resolution to this pressing issue.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue.  Everyone who follows the news will be familiar with the problems being experienced in rapidly developing parts of Dublin and other cities where the provision of school facilities has fallen behind the rapid increase in population.  Fortunately, the position is better this year.  Following the crisis that occurred last year, which resulted in the Department setting up emergency schools during the summer, action was taken in recent months.  As a result of this and the <Col N="91"/>decisions to establish one or two new schools in Dublin 15 while expanding existing schools, we will not experience the problems we had in the past.</P>
        <P>The difficulty to which I refer concerns three schools &mdash; Castleknock community college, the only non-fee paying school in Castleknock, which has a population of 40,000; St. Mochta&rsquo;s national school in Clonsilla; and St. Brigid&rsquo;s national school, Beech Park Castleknock.  The three schools were approached by the Department of Education and Science to expand.  St. Mochta&rsquo;s was asked to accept a fourth stream and the community college was asked to increase its intake to 210 students per year.  Each school agreed to do so.  In return, they were promised new school buildings with modern classrooms to facilitate the expansion with two schools promised sports halls.  However, the Department has not honoured its commitment and the schools have been informed they cannot apply for planning permission or even to go to architectural stage in one case.</P>
        <P>That is a serious breach of faith on the part of the Department, which has a problem with schools refusing to expand.  The schools to which I refer responded to the Department&rsquo;s need and went along with its request but they have been shafted for reasons that are unclear to them and myself.  I am interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  If he has influence with the line Minister in this regard, I appeal to him to put pressure on the Department to ensure these projects proceed because if they do not, the message will be sent to other schools that if they agree to a request by the Department to expand, they cannot rely on the commitment and guarantees given in return.  That will have knock-on effects in other constituencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this motion on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the actions being taken by the Department of Education and Science to address the school accommodation needs in the Dublin 15 area.  I am conscious that the Dublin 15 area, as a whole, is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the country, as Deputy Varadkar stated, and, as a result, there has been a marked increase in the demand for primary school places.</P>
        <P>The Department conducted a survey of all primary schools in Dublin 15 to determine the number of junior infants who enrolled in September 2006 and 2007.  This survey indicated considerable numbers of children applied to enrol in more than one school.  While this is understandable from parents&rsquo; point of view, it also has the result of inflating the number of children apparently seeking places.  Notwithstanding this, the Department of Education and Science is aware of the accommodation demands for September and is addressing this requirement.  I assure the Deputy that all options will be considered to ensure that there are enough school places in September.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the programme for Government included a commitment to establish a developing areas unit in the Department of Education and Science, dedicated solely to progressing school planning in rapidly developing areas, including Dublin 15, building on improvements that have been made in recent years.</P>
        <P>The Department is taking a number of measures to increase the capacity of existing schools in the area concerned with the development of new schools to meet this growing demand.  All building projects arising from these are awarded a band 1 priority rating under the Department&rsquo;s prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects to ensure that they are delivered as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>The position on recent and ongoing developments in the provision of school accommodation in the Dublin 15 area is as follows.  A new 16 classroom school for Mary Mother of Hope national school in Littlepace opened in September 2007.  In addition, a new school for Cas<Col N="92"/>taheany Educate Together is on schedule to open for September 2008 and a new school for St. Benedict&rsquo;s national school is set to follow shortly thereafter.  Extension projects for primary schools in Castleknock, Blanchardstown and Corduff are also being progressed.  In the Diswellstown area, St. Patrick&rsquo;s national school moved into a new 24-classroom school last year.  This will facilitate an annual three-stream intake.</P>
        <P>A site is being secured for a new permanent school building for Tyrrelstown Educate Together national school and Mulhuddart national school and these buildings will be progressed.  A new State model community national school, under the patronage of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee, is to be piloted in Phibblestown from September 2008.  This will initially provide accommodation for an eight-classroom school, to be expanded to 24 classrooms as need is assessed.</P>
        <P>With regard to the specific schools to which the Deputy refers, the current position is as follows.  Castleknock community school is at stage 3 of early architectural planning.  The stage 3 submission has been received and reviewed by the Department&rsquo;s technical staff and is awaiting approval.  As soon as approval is received for this stage, the Department will liaise with the school authorities.  St. Brigid&rsquo;s national school, Castleknock, is at stage 1 of early architectural planning.  The Department&rsquo;s technical staff requested additional information on the stage 1 submission and this information is being reviewed.  A report on the stage 1 submission will issue as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>St. Mochta&rsquo;s national school was expanded in 2006 to cater for an annual four-stream intake.  The extension to cater for this development has been progressed to architectural planning and a project supervisor for the design process has been appointed.  The appointment of a design team will be progressed as soon as possible.  All three school projects are being progressed without delay.</P>
        <P>Due to the level of demand emanating from the Dublin 15 area, the need to make further provision at primary level in addition to that outlined above is being kept under continuous review by the Department.  I am confident that the measures outlined will assist in alleviating the immediate demand for pupil places in the area and I thank Deputy Varadkar for allowing me the opportunity to outline the Department&rsquo;s position on school provision in this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not accept that there have been failures in the implementation of the current Strategy.  While there have been difficulties in progressing some of the actions at the rate envisaged, my view is that the Strategy has had significant successes, be it in the areas <Col N="94"/>of treatment and rehabilitation, supply reduction, prevention or research.  Some of the main achievements to date include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the level of drugs seizures by the Garda&iacute; and the Customs Service have been well in excess of the targets set out in the Strategy and they include a number of significant operations;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />under the prevention pillar, the SPHE and Walk Tall programmes have been rolled out to all schools; awareness campaigns have been organised and tremendous achievements have been made under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />treatment facilities have increased significantly, with approximately 8,600 clients now receiving methadone, and a range of services are being provided across the statutory, voluntary and community sectors for various types of problem drug use; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />research in areas such as drugs prevalence, the outcomes of treatment, families and drugs, the effect of drugs on communities and cocaine issues have all helped to inform our progress under the Strategy. </P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">With regard to the new Strategy, two meetings of the Steering Group established to develop proposals for the period 2009 &ndash; 2016 have already been held, and the Group will continue to meet regularly in the coming months.</P>
        <P>As part of their work, the Group will be examining the progress and impact of the current National Drugs Strategy, the degree to which it continues to be relevant and the operational effectiveness of the structures involved. They will also be looking at developments in regard to drug policies at EU and international levels.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Group are currently finalising details of the comprehensive public consultation process that will be undertaken over the coming 2-3 months as part of their work in developing the new Strategy.  Indeed, the Deputy should note that I intend to be directly involved in many of the consultation meetings that are being planned at present. It is envisaged that the Steering Group will meet with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sports, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to hear their views on the new strategy.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am confident that the new Strategy will be finalised by the end of this year. In addition, I believe that the new Strategy will have the full co-operation and buy-in from all relevant Government Departments and Agencies involved.</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />development and launch of the Walks Scheme by my Department, which is  currently being piloted on four routes and it is anticipated that when the Scheme is bedded down it will be rolled out to a further eight routes this year, with others coming on stream in 2009,</P><Col N="96"/>
<?oasys _fp ?><P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />agreement with F&aacute;ilte Ireland regarding the employment of 11 Rural Recreation Officers (RRO).  Their role will be to promote walking tourism in areas where there are clusters of suitable, accessible walks.  The RRO will act as a contact person for walking tourists and will provide a wide range of support and advice. I understand that recruitment of these Rural Recreation Officers is now well underway,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /> have made over &euro;1.3million in capital funding available to F&aacute;ilte Ireland to assist in the development of the national network of looped walks to a total of 50 trailheads and 75 Loops,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />I have allocated &euro;90,000 (&euro;30,000 per annum from 2006-2008) to Wicklow Uplands Council and Wicklow Rural Partnership to provide a network of access routes over private lands in areas of high scenic and amenity value in County Wicklow,</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, my Department is actively pursuing the possibility of using former railway infrastructure as recreational trails &mdash; for activities such as walking and cycling &mdash; with the Department of Transport and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.

        <P>Separately, discussions are continuing with Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na to discuss the possibility of expanding the use of their lands for recreational purposes and I will continue to progress this matter as I believe that there is  considerable potential here to make significant contributions to rural recreation.</P>

        <P>The main achievements to date include the following:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />All provisions of the Act have been in operation since July 2006, while the office of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga has been in existence since February 2004.</P><Col N="98"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A total of 75 schemes, which cover a total of 132 public bodies, including my own Department, have been confirmed and published.  All 75 schemes are available on the website of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga at www.coimisineir.ie In addition, 41 draft schemes covering a total of 78 public bodies are currently in the course of preparation and my Department is in discussion with the bodies concerned in relation to the completion of the drafting process.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In April 2006, I made Regulations that updated the list of public bodies covered under the Act and I intend to make further such Regulations during 2008.</P>

In this context, my Department has commenced a consultation process with the public bodies concerned, as well as a number of other interested parties, with the aim of establishing priorities for the second round of schemes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) and the National Drugs Strategy Team (NDST) reported to the Interdepartmental Group on Drugs (IDG) in September 2006 setting out a series of recommendations on how to best tackle the emerging cocaine problem. This paper formed the basis for their joint report &ldquo;An Overview of Cocaine Use in Ireland II&rdquo;, which was published in March 2007.  I am pursuing the implementation of the recommendations of the report with the HSE, the Garda&iacute;, Drugs Task Forces and others through the Inter-Departmental Group (IDG), which I chair. </P>
        <P>The recommendations principally relate to treatment but also cover supply, prevention, and research.  A key conclusion of the report is that available evidence indicated that many approaches already in use in the general addiction services, particularly counselling, work well with cocaine users.  The broad approach being pursued is that drug services should be capable of catering for the individual problem drug user, regardless of the drugs they use. At the recent IDG meeting in March, the HSE provided an up-date on the progress being made in regard to adapting existing services to meet emerging needs, in particular cocaine.</P><Col N="99"/>
        <P>Another key recommendation relates to the training of frontline personnel to deal with cocaine issues.  In this regard, a training initiative has already been funded by my Department, as well as four pilot cocaine treatment projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use.   Currently the HSE is rolling out further training for both its own staff and those in the community and voluntary sectors who are dealing with the issue.</P>
        <P>Under the Emerging Needs Fund, six cocaine specific projects in Local Drugs Task Force areas have been funded by my Department and support for a further nine projects &mdash; aimed at polydrug/cocaine use &mdash; has also been provided under that Fund.</P>
        <P>Last year, my Department also sponsored a highly successful conference organised by the SAOL project and the NDST on the response to cocaine through shared good practice.  A very useful resource pack for workers in the field was launched at that event.</P>
        <P>To build on these measures, last week I announced a &euro;2m funding package to develop initiatives aimed at tackling cocaine use and raising awareness about cocaine in local communities, as well as supporting the rehabilitation of drug users.</P>
        <P>With regard to supply reduction, there has been a significant increase in the volume of drugs seized, and the number of seizures, by both the Garda&iacute; and the Custom Service over the past number of years.  Much of this is down to a successful intelligence led approach pursued both nationally and internationally.  I am also assured that the recent establishment, on a permanent basis, of an Organised Crime Unit focusing on gangland related criminal activity by the Garda&iacute;, will assist both national and local Drugs Units in relation to drug trafficking and distribution.</P>
        <P>The challenges posed by cocaine use are significant, but I am confident that we can meet these challenges through a co-ordinated approach utilising the structures of the National Drugs Strategy.</P>

	<P>Both the Garda&iacute; and the D/JE&amp;LR are represented on the National Drugs Strategy Team (NDST), which is, in fact, currently chaired by the Garda representative on the Team.   The NDST meets regularly to discuss the implementation of the relevant actions in the Strategy.  In addition, the Garda&iacute; and the Probation Services are represented on the Drugs Task Forces and this ensures that issues can be addressed as they arise at local or regional levels.</P>
        <P>At the Inter-Departmental Group on Drugs (IDG), which I chair, the Garda&iacute;, the D/JE&amp;LR and the Prison Service are represented and provide regular reports at the quarterly meetings.</P>
        <P>With regard to the new National Drugs Strategy, the Deputy should note that the Garda&iacute; have two representatives and the D/JE&amp;LR has one representative on the Steering Group established to oversee the development of the new Strategy.   The representatives &ndash; along with the others on the Group &mdash; will be playing a significant role in the development of the new Strategy over the coming months.</P>
        <P>Finally, it is also envisaged that meetings with both organisations will be held as part of the consultation process being undertaken for the new Strategy.</P>

	<P>In 2006, under the Dormant Accounts Fund, an indicative amount of &euro;500,000 was earmarked for programmes and projects targeted at vulnerable immigrant families.

Once these have been agreed with landholders, the scheme will be implemented. It is expected that the first scheme payments to landowners on the 4 pilot areas will be made in early summer.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the development of the Walks Scheme, my Department has  also reached agreement with F&aacute;ilte Ireland regarding the employment of 11 Rural Recreation Officers (RRO).  Their role will be to promote walking tourism in areas where there are clusters of suitable, accessible walks.  The RRO will act as a contact person for walking tourists and will provide a wide range of support and advice.  Recruitment of these RROs is well underway, including those in the Walks Scheme pilot areas, and they should be appointed in the coming weeks.  The Rural Recreation Officer will provide vital support in rolling out the Walks Scheme.</P>

        <Quest> the expected expenditure by his Department in 2008 from the proceeds of the Dormant Accounts Fund; the figures for each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF) became operational in 2003, approximately &euro;145m has been approved to support over 5,163 groups and organisations involved in tackling disadvantage and assisting persons with a disability.  </P>
        <P>Initially, decisions on the disbursements of funds from dormant accounts were a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts.  Under the initial round of funding in 2003 and 2004, the Board approved 521 projects for funding totalling approximately &euro;63m.  Details of these individual grants and organisations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.pobail.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005, decisions on disbursements since 2006 have been made by Government, following a transparent process.  The following table summarises the &euro;82.16m in allocations approved by Government since the beginning of 2006.  Details of the individual grants and organisations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, as outlined above.</P>
        <P>Further allocations can be anticipated over the coming months, in respect of applications currently being processed, under the educational disadvantage and economic and social disadvantage categories.  Details will be announced as soon as the allocations have been approved by Government.</P>
        <P>In addition to the grants detailed above, &euro;52.4m has been allocated to date from the DAF to part-finance the Rural Social Scheme and a further &euro;10m has been approved for allocation to support a Fund for an Early Intervention Programme for Children.  These allocations were approved by Government, following consultation with the Dormant Accounts Board. The Dormant Accounts Programme for 2008 was approved by Government on 11th March and details of the relevant measures that will be eligible for funding this year &mdash; and the overall level of funding to be allocated &mdash; will shortly be made available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy should note that the value of the Fund at end of January 2008, net of liabilities, was &euro;102.869m and that information on transfers into and allocations and actual disbursements from the fund are posted on my Departments web site and regularly updated.</P><Col N="106"/>

	<P>Tackling the problem of drugs misuse is a key priority for the Government and will continue to be so.  This commitment is evidenced by the allocation of over &euro;64m in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for Drugs Initiatives and the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund in 2008.  This, the Deputy should note, represents an increase of nearly 29% on the original 2007 allocation.  </P>
        <P>The funding will facilitate the progress towards the fulfilment of commitments in the Programme for Government, including developing and strengthening the range of projects being undertaken through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces.</P>
        <P>The additional funding will allow for further progress towards the full implementation of the agreed work programmes of the Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs).  Expenditure in 2007 on the ten RDTF plans came to over &euro;7m and the increased provision in 2008 will allow for the full year cost of the approx. 150 community projects already in progress and the start of roughly another 40 projects in 2008.</P>
        <P>In addition, a further &euro;2m has been allocated in 2008 to develop and strengthen the work of the Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTFs) and to facilitate the implementation of projects under the Emerging Needs Fund. Over 440 LDTF projects, including those under the Emerging Needs Fund, are receiving funding from my Department.  The 2008 allocation of &euro;22m for such projects shows an increase of 9.5% over the amount spent in 2007.</P>
        <P>Finally, with regard to capital funding, Drugs Task Forces can continue to apply for capital funding under the Premises Initiative Fund which addresses the accommodation needs of community based projects in their areas.</P>

	<P>Gaming machines or slot machines, which are normally referred to as fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs), are not permitted on the premises of a licensed bookmaker.  The issue of FOBTs is one of the matters considered by the Casino Committee on regulating gaming in Ireland which has reported to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is expected that the Report of the Casino Committee will be published shortly and the Government plans to establish an All-Party Committee to consider its content.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are provisions for a wide range of fines and penalties which can be imposed in particular situations for failure to comply with Revenue law and that they pursue penalties/fines in appropriate cases either through court proceedings or as part of a settlement. The circumstances in which these can be applied are set down in various legislative provisions. The recovery of fines and penalties is an integral part of the overall enforcement process by Revenue. The level and range of fines and penalties is reviewed in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process and I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are making full use of the deterrents at their disposal to enable them to carry out all of their functions effectively.  </P>
        <P>A complete inventory of all of the fines and penalties available to the Revenue Commissioners could not be compiled within the timeframe for issue of a reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question. However the main fines and penalties applied are listed in the Appendix attached.</P>

        <Quest> if he will extend the research and development tax credit beyond its current limit; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12618/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Deputy, in referring to a &ldquo;current limit&rdquo;, believes that there is a termination date for the Research and Development (R&amp;D) tax credit scheme. At the outset, I should make it clear that there is no termination date for this scheme. As with all taxation expenditure, the scheme is subject to ongoing review and changes have been made to the scheme for this purpose over recent Finance Acts, including the 2008 Finance Act. This process of review will continue in order to ensure that the scheme continues to make a strong contribution to the Government&rsquo;s strategy to encourage the undertaking of more research and development activity in this country.</P>
        <P>Under the scheme introduced in 2004, a tax credit of 20% of the incremental or additional spend on qualifying R&amp;D as compared to R&amp;D expenditure in a base year can be offset against a company&rsquo;s corporation tax liability. As originally envisaged, the base year for expenditure used to calculate the qualifying incremental expenditure on R&amp;D was to be 2003 for the first 3 years of the scheme to 2006.  In Finance Act 2007, the use of 2003 as the base year was extended for another 3 years of claim up to and including 2009.  Budget and Finance Act 2008 extended this by a further 4 years to 2013. In addition, changes were made in Finance Act 2008 to provide that when the base year rolls forward for accounting periods after 2013, there will be a 10 year gap on a &ldquo;look-back&rdquo; basis between the year in which the tax credit is claimed and the base year expenditure for calculating the credit. For example, this means that for claims made under the scheme in respect of 2014, the base year expenditure will move forward to 2004 and so on.</P>
        <P>These changes were made to provide an additional incentive for increased expenditure on R&amp;D in future years and to offer more certainty to industry in relation to the tax credit scheme.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he will take steps to ensure that value added tax which is levied upon defibrillators is removed in the context of the importance of same and in particular in the further context where communities are making valiant efforts to ensure that a number of defibrillators are available throughout the community and whereby volunteers are undertaking training in the operation of same and whereby the imposition of VAT is an unnecessary charge levied upon this very worthwhile service; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12678/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that in matters relating to the VAT rating of goods and services, I am constrained by the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. In this regard, I would point out that the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service depends on the nature of the good or service and not on the status of the consumer. In this case, there is no provision in EU law that would permit the removal or reduction of VAT based on the social or economic status of the consumer.</P>
        <P>In relation to the VAT rate that applies to defibrillators, the position is that under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. The zero VAT rate cannot therefore be applied to defibrillators which are subject to the standard rate.</P>
        <P>In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. While Annex III does include <Col N="119"/>the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use. The reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.</P>

        <P>Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.</P>

	<P>The breakdown of all buildings under the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, that are lit up at night, as in dedicated facade lighting, is not readily available and would require a survey. However, generally buildings of significant historical or architectural importance have such lighting. In some instances this type of lighting also provides a security function. It is policy that buildings of such note are lit continuously in the hours of darkness for both aesthetic and functional reasons. The type of lighting used for this purpose is very energy efficient.</P>

As part of this campaign an audit of both electrical and thermal energy consumption will be conducted. Exceptional and excessive consumption outside normal office hours will be identified and targeted for reduction. This is expected to be a key contributor to the expected savings. A pilot programme carried out in advance of the main campaign demonstrated that there was potential for savings in this area.</P>

	<P>I understand from the Health Service Executive (HSE), that owing to regulatory difficulties being experienced by the manufacturer of the BCG vaccine, there was a shortage of the vaccine throughout the country from late 2007. This was a Europe wide problem as the manufacturer in question is the only company which supplies the vaccine to the European Market. Unfortunately, it is not possible to stockpile the vaccine in advance as it has a very short shelf life. These difficulties have now been resolved and new stocks of licensed vaccine are now available.</P>
        <P>BCG vaccine has arrived in the country and is currently being delivered to all sites. Parents of any baby who has not received BCG vaccine will be contacted by their local Health Office with an appointment to receive the vaccine. I understand from the HSE that clinics have now resumed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 70 together.</P>
        <P>The reduction in the wholesale mark-up paid on the price of drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes is part of a process aimed at reforming all aspects of the drugs supply chain from the manufacturer to the patient.  The existing wholesale mark-up in the range of 15% to 17.6% is neither reasonable nor sustainable. The Government  supports the HSE&rsquo;s decision to pay an 8% mark-up from 1 March, and 7% from 1 January 2009 which will be applied by reducing the reimbursement price paid to community pharmacy contractors from those dates.</P>
<P>In response to demands from community pharmacists to address the alleged impact of the new wholesale pricing arrangements on GMS dependent pharmacies in particular, the HSE has offered a voluntary interim contract with a flat rate dispensing fee of not less than &euro;5 for all dispensing made on the GMS and community drug schemes.</P>
<P>I have established an Independent Body to assess an interim, fair community pharmacy dispensing fee of at least &euro;5 to be paid for the medical card scheme, the DPS and other community drug schemes. This Body is being chaired by Se&aacute;n Dorgan, former Head of IDA Ireland. It has been asked to make its recommendations by the end of May 2008. Based on its consideration of submissions received and its own independent evaluation, the Body will recommend an appropriate dispensing fee that would, in its view, represent a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the pharmaceutical service currently being provided by community pharmacists to the HSE under the GMS and community drug schemes. If approved by Government, it will be backdated to the date from which any individual community pharmacist may choose to avail of the HSE&rsquo;s offer.</P>
<P Just="Left">Accordingly, each community pharmacist will have three options: to avail of the interim contract as recently offered by the HSE; to accept the interim contract upon the report of the Independent Body; or to stay with the existing retail fee structure until the agreement of a substantive new contract. I believe this provides all concerned with a reasonable way to make the transition to a fair and transparent method of payment for present services and, I hope, greatly developed pharmacy services in the near future. While a number of community pharmacies have indicated their intention to withdraw services under their contracts with the HSE, I understand that no contractor has formally withdrawn their services at this point. There are <Col N="122"/>no changes planned to the operation of the GMS and community drugs schemes and all patients continue to receive their entitlements in the usual way.</P>

	<P>Regulation of the nursing and midwifery professions, including the setting of requirements and standards in relation to the education programmes for registration,  is the statutory responsibility of An Bord Altranais. The Board is a broadly representative body.  The twenty nine members include seventeen elected by nurses who are representative of all the divisions of the register. In November 2004 the Board approved a number of changes to the Nurses Rules including the following amended rule in relation to admission requirements for nurses wishing to train in public health nursing. </P>
        <P>Before admission to the programme for education and training leading to registration in the Public Health Nurses Division of the Register, the name of the candidate for the registration <Col N="124"/>must already be entered in the Register of Nurses and the candidate must have two years clinical experience in nursing. Unless the candidate&rsquo;s name is entered in the Midwives Division of the Register, the candidate must complete an An Bord Altranais approved module or unit of study on Maternal and Child Health as part of the programme&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>I understand that in framing this rule change the Board was mindful of recommendation 8.30 of the Report of the Commission on Nursing which recommended dropping the mandatory requirement for a midwifery qualification for those wishing to train as public health nurses. My approval is required under Section 26 of the Nurses Act 1985 and these rules were formally approved by me in December 2004 as soon as they were submitted by the Board.</P>

	<P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.</P>
        <P>It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.</P>
        <P>The HSE received additional funding of &euro;40m in the period 2006 to 2008 for the establishment of some 200 primary care teams involving some 600 additional front line professionals.</P>
        <P>The Government has committed under the Towards 2016 agreement to the establishment of 300 Primary Care teams by 2008; 400 by 2009 and 500 by 2011. A review of these targets is due to be undertaken in 2008.</P>
        <P>The provision of the appropriate infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of primary care services is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors.  These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.</P>

        <P>The Government&rsquo;s sustained high level of investment in health care has enabled the completion and commissioning of numerous new facilities in both the acute and the non-acute sectors.   This year, overall capital funding of approximately &euro;594m has been provided to the Health Service Executive.</P><Col N="127"/>
        <P Just="Left">In drawing up its Capital Plan the Health Service Executive is required to prioritise the capital infrastructure projects to be progressed within its overall capital funding allocation under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, taking account of the NDP targets for division of capital investment between the Acute and Primary, Community &amp; Continuing Care pillars.  The HSE has submitted a draft Capital Plan to my Department for consideration and approval in the normal way which sets out the HSE&rsquo;s proposed short and longer term priorities and commitments.  Consultation on this draft Capital Plan is ongoing between the HSE, the Department of Finance and my Department.  The HSE has undertaken to provide additional clarification on its proposed capital developments and is currently engaged in this process. Details on individual projects will not be known until such time as the capital plan for 2008 is approved.</P>

        <P>That process has been undertaken in connection with an application by the National Roads Authority for redesignation of elements of the N6, N7, N8 and N9 as motorways.  The consultation process expired on Friday 28th March 2008.</P>
        <P>Two written submissions were received in relation to the Kinnegad Athlone section of the N6.</P>
        <P>I will now consider all of the submissions received and I will make a decision on whether to grant the application from the NRA as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

I gave the agencies an opportunity to make written submissions to me before I finalising my decision.  I recently received the written submissions of the agencies and I will communicate my final decision to them shortly.</P>

        <P>The timescales for these works will be dependant on local authority road schemes.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has also advised that the resignalling of the Maynooth line, which will be completed by the end of 2011, may precede some of the crossing closures.</P>

	<P>The Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) are trade agreements currently being negotiated between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states.</P><Col N="135"/>
        <P>The mandate for the negotiation of EPAs comes from the legally-binding Cotonou Agreement, the central objective of which is that of &ldquo;reducing and eventually eradicating poverty, consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Negotiations began in September 2002. The original intention was for the European Union to conclude comprehensive EPAs with six regional groupings of the ACP States. Following protracted and difficult negotiations, only one of the regional groupings, CARIFORUM (the Caribbean Forum of ACP States) representing the 15 countries of the Caribbean, signed a full EPA with the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Twenty other ACP countries have so far initialled interim agreements in smaller sub-groups of the original regional groupings. All the agreements have full duty and quota free market access on the EU side and a flexible and asymmetric liberalisation schedule on the ACP side. It is envisaged that the interim agreements, which already define much of the framework for negotiations, will act as building blocks to full EPAs. This has to be done by agreement on both sides. Increased EU market access and support for regional integration through the EPAs is intended to bring real trade growth and broad based economic development in the ACP countries.</P>
        <P>The Government have consistently maintained that the EPA negotiations should result in agreements that are supportive of ACP countries&rsquo; development needs and their poverty reduction efforts. The Taoiseach made the point at the EU-Africa summit in Lisbon last December that the EU approach should be one of goodwill, flexibility and partnership.</P>
        <P>I believe that it should be a matter for the ACP countries themselves to decide whether or not to sign comprehensive EPAs with the European Union in the future. I will continue to monitor developments with a view to supporting a partnership approach between the European Commission and ACP countries in further negotiations. It is vitally important that whatever arrangements are put in place do not disadvantage the developing countries. That will continue to be the core of our approach.</P>

	<P>The Passport Office provides a comprehensive range of options for citizens to apply for passports. Applications may be made by express post through some 1,000 post offices across the state and some 70 post offices in Northern Ireland. A guaranteed 10 working day service is available for such applications which are complete and in order. Less urgent applications can also be made by ordinary post.</P>
        <P>Applicants can also apply in person at the public offices in Dublin and Cork. Very positive comments are frequently made about the quality of service available at the public offices and I know also that the availability of a local office in Cork (which deals with applications across Munster) is greatly appreciated.</P>
        <P>The issue of renewed calls for the establishment of a passport office in Tallaght has not been brought to my attention in recent months. Against the above background, the issue of opening additional offices in other locations, including in Tallaght, will be kept under ongoing active review.</P>

	<P>My Department, and our Embassy in Beijing, are in close touch with the Olympic Council of Ireland in regard to preparations for the Olympic Games. The Department would be happy to respond to any queries the Council, or individual athletes, may have about human rights in China, or indeed other concerns, including the issue of Tibet.</P>
        <P>The Government concerns in regard to human rights in China are raised on a regular basis in bilateral contacts with the Government of China. Discussions in this regard take place at official level in Dublin and in Beijing. We continue to stress the value that Ireland attaches to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. We have also raised our concerns about the practice of religion and the preservation of cultural identity in Tibet. In particular, we have stressed the importance of the Chinese authorities making every effort possible to facilitate freedom of movement and expression, including the right to peaceful protest, in the run-up to &mdash; and during &mdash; the Olympic Games in Beijing later this year.</P>

	<P>The British Government commissioned an independent review of citizenship carried out by former British Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, who issued his report on 11 March. The report, which I would point out is a consultative document, refers to the voting rights of Irish citizens in Britain. The British Government have indicated that it is considering the report in the context of its ongoing constitutional review and stressed that no decisions have yet been taken.</P>
        <P>My officials were briefed on the contents of the report by British officials upon publication and agreed there would be further discussion between the two Governments.</P>
        <P>The Government is carefully examining the report, including any implications for Good Friday Agreement commitments. A particular priority for the Government in ongoing contacts with the British Government will be to ensure that any proposals that may emerge would be consistent with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>The provision of reciprocal voting rights for Irish and British citizens reflects our historic relations and is a valuable expression of the special ties between the two countries to the mutual benefit of our citizens. We will maintain ongoing contact with the British Government on this issue and have already conveyed these initial views to the British authorities.</P>

	<P>Article 2 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, incorporated in the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967, states that &ldquo;The establishment of diplomatic relations between States, and of permanent diplomatic missions, takes place by mutual consent&rdquo;. Ireland currently has diplomatic relations with 115 countries of which 55 have resident missions in Dublin, with the remainder accredited on a non-resident basis, mostly from London.</P>
        <P>The normal practice is for the Government to accede to requests to accredit an Ambassador on either a resident or non-resident basis where diplomatic relations exist. However, in the case of Burma, the Government has made it clear to the Burmese authorities that no steps will be taken to advance diplomatic relations, including the accreditation of their Ambassador in London on a non-residential basis, until a number of developments in that country have taken place, in particular the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.</P>

	<P>Irish Aid has in place rigorous accounting and audit controls. Audits of the Irish Aid programme are undertaken on the basis of a three-year rolling work plan, managed by the Evaluation and Audit Unit, with clear priority being given to the audit of expenditure in programme countries. During 2006 and 2007 eight visits took place to programme countries covering a range of aspects of the audit process.</P>
        <P>The countries and number of times visited were: Mozambique (2), Zambia (2), Ethiopia, Tanzania, South Africa and Uganda. The purpose of the visits varied from recruitment and induction of newly recruited internal auditors, presentations and updates on audit to Heads of Missions, attendance at training courses on Public Financial Management in Africa, visit by a member of the independent audit committee and audits on Irish Aid programme expenditure.</P>
        <P>The reports and information prepared include details of recruitment and induction carried out, minutes of meetings held, documentation on training courses and reports on findings and recommendations made.</P>
        <P>The findings and recommendations arising from these visits are geared towards strengthening the existing systems to cater for the expanding budget of Irish Aid. Examples include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A recommendation to strengthen Irish Aid&rsquo;s approach to assessing partners&rsquo; governance and financial systems prior to funding being committed. This has been implemented.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A recommendation that Embassies should introduce a uniform checklist for use prior to payments of grants to partners. This recommendation has been implemented, and the checklist ensures that all necessary approvals and documentation are in order when payment is being made.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The need to strengthen partners&rsquo; reporting on the use of Irish Aid funds and ensure that the Embassies have a formal system to review these reports. This recommendation has been implemented.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A recommendation that Irish Aid should host Public Financial Management training courses for Embassy-based staff to enhance their capacity to work with government part<Col N="138"/>ners to strengthen their systems of financial control.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 105 to 108, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The work programme of the Evaluation and Audit Unit is primarily focused on providing assurance with regard to monies already spent by Irish Aid in recipient countries. I would emphasise also that Irish Aid has in place robust systems for oversight and control of spending that commence before funding is even committed. In this regard, major programme expenditure to recipient countries (and large Irish NGOs) is subject to a comprehensive approval process by a Project Approval and Evaluation Group (PAEG). The group is chaired by the Director or Deputy Director General of Irish Aid. Its members include independent external consultants who review all expenditure proposals. The approval process includes a risk assessment, which aims to ensure that risks are considered at the commencement of Irish Aid&rsquo;s support for a programme, and that appropriate mitigation strategies are embedded in the programme.</P>
        <P>A key element of oversight and control is the Irish Aid financial procedures manual which contains clear, centralised rules against which all the programme country missions are audited. This manual is regularly reviewed. In addition each of the missions has suitably skilled finance and audit personnel whose job is to assist and advise management on the implementation of these procedures.</P>
        <P>The Evaluation and Audit Unit&rsquo;s audit process is an important oversight mechanism for Irish Aid programme country expenditure and is organised as follows:</P><Col N="139"/>
<P el="5">(a) <Miles com="ix" />Work carried out directly by Irish Aid&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit, and by internal auditors based at Missions in programme countries;</P>
<P el="5">(b) <Miles com="ix" />Work carried out by internationally reputable audit firms commissioned by Irish Aid;</P>
<P el="5">(c) <Miles com="ix" />Joint donor funded audits of specific programmes (e.g. of the health sector in Mozambique, where Ireland jointly funds an audit with Canada, Denmark and Switzerland), and</P>
<P el="5">(d) <Miles com="ix" />Audit reports obtained from partner organisations (e.g. those carried out by National Audit Offices and by non-governmental Organisations).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The day to day work of the Internal Auditors in programme countries, which is overseen by the Evaluation and Audit Unit at Headquarters, focuses on issues arising in all audit reports received. Based on the audit work described above, issues can arise at the Missions, but more generally in partner organisations (both Governments and NGOs). The Internal Auditors, together with Embassy-based Programme Development Staff, work together with these partner organisations to assist with the implementation of audit recommendations. In some cases this means assisting with strengthening the capacity and systems of these partners.</P>
        <P>Some examples of changes to oversight and control on Irish Aid spending, introduced as a result of audit work, are as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The implementation by Irish Aid of an agreed approach to assessing partners&rsquo; governance and financial systems prior to funding being committed.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The introduction of a uniform checklist for use in all Embassies prior to payments of grants to partners. This will ensure that all necessary approvals and documentation are in order when payment is being made.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Strengthening of partners&rsquo; reporting on the use of Irish Aid funds and ensuring that the Embassies have a formal system to review these reports.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Hosting Public Financial Management training courses for Embassy-based staff to enhance their capacity to work with government partners to strengthen their systems of financial control.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Department&rsquo;s Audit Committee provides an independent appraisal of Irish Aid&rsquo;s audit and evaluation arrangements through regular interaction and follow-up with the Evaluation and Audit Unit and with Senior Management. The Committee meets regularly with the Secretary General and, annually, with the Comptroller and Auditor General. It also publishes an annual report on its work. The Audit Committee actively monitors implementation of the recommendations of their reports.</P>

	<P>The Minister for European Affairs, Mr. Dick Roche TD, visited three cities in China, Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, to represent the Government in the context of the recent annual St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations. </P>
        <P>As is the norm for such St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visits, the visit was not an official one but rather the primary focus was on reaching out to the growing Irish Diaspora in China, and the promotion of the objectives of the Government&rsquo;s Asia Strategy across a broad range of activities and sectors, including trade, investment, educational cooperation, culture, Irish food products and tourism. The visit was highly successful.</P>
        <P>No official consultations with the Chinese Government took place during the visit. Minister of State Roche was guest of honour at the Embassy of Ireland&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day reception on 14th March. The Minister had a courtesy meeting at the Embassy of Ireland, in the margins of the reception, with Chinese Assistant Minister Wu Hongbo. At that stage, the unfolding events in Tibet were unclear and reports were scarce and unreliable. In the absence of clear information, given the informal nature of the encounter, the issue of Tibet was not discussed on that occasion.</P>
        <P>On my instructions, senior officials of my Department since 17 March have been in regular touch with the Chinese Embassy in Dublin to seek information about developments in Tibet and to convey my deep concern at the situation there. On Tuesday 1 April, I was happy to meet with representatives of the Tibet Support Group-Ireland and to discuss with them their concerns regarding the current situation, and how these might be addressed.</P>

        <Quest> if he will examine a situation where F&Aacute;S in the south west region are stating that the programme for long-term unemployed people who are over 55 years of age, which was introduced in November 2004 and which would allow people to stay on community employment schemes for up to six years and which was subsequently increased by a further year for those in receipt of disability payments, is over-subscribed in that age category at present and they can not facilitate applications which has been the case for quite some time; and when places in that particular category will be available again. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and assists them in enhancing/developing both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April, 2000). Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and people with disabilities may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</P>
        <P>The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  F&Aacute;S makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  F&Aacute;S also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</P>
        <P>In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a review of the operation and implementation of the Competition Act 2002 is underway.  In the context of this review, I have established an Advisory Group to <Col N="148"/>review the current legislative framework relating to the public interest aspects of media mergers in Ireland.</P>
        <P>My role under the media provisions in the Act involves considering media mergers in the context of the relevant criteria set out in Section 23(10) of the Competition Act.  These criteria essentially relate to diversity/plurality, the strength and competitiveness of media businesses indigenous to the State and the dispersion of media ownership amongst individuals and other undertakings.  In the context of the ongoing review, I believe it is appropriate to examine the criteria and arrangements for considering and assessing how a proposed merger might affect the diversity of views and the concentration of ownership within and across media businesses.</P>
        <P>The Terms of Reference for the Group are: To review and consider the current levels of plurality and diversity in the media sector in Ireland; To examine and review the relevant criteria as currently defined in the Act; To examine and consider how the application of the relevant criteria should be given effect and by whom; To examine the role of the Minister in assessing the relevant criteria from a public interest perspective and the best mechanism to do so; To examine international best practice including the applicability of models from others countries; and to make recommendations, as appropriate, on the above.</P>
        <P>The members of the Advisory Group on Media Mergers are as follows:</P>

	<P>Section 33 of the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004 provides that the Labour Court may at any time, on the application of any person, give its decision on any question as to the interpretation of a registered employment agreement or its application to a particular person. Therefore, it is open to any person to clarify the applicability of these Agreements.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be interested to note that a definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; is provided in Section 23 of the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">&ldquo;worker&rdquo; means any person aged 15 years or more who has entered into or works under a contract with an employer, whether the contract be for manual labour, clerical work or otherwise, whether it be expressed or implied, oral or in writing, and whether it be a contract of service or of apprenticeship or a contract personally to execute any work or labour.</P>

	<P>The &ldquo;Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Act, 2007&rdquo; was enacted in December 2007 with the objective, inter alia, of facilitating the introduction of a Public Lending remuneration scheme.  During the passage of the legislation in the Houses of the Oireachtas, it was pointed out that responsibility for the introduction of an operational lending scheme resides with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage, and Local Government.  The scheme will be introduced by way of Ministerial Regulations under the 2007 Act.  I understand from my Ministerial colleague that Regulations to introduce an operational lending <Col N="150"/>scheme are at an advanced stage of preparation and that the scheme is expected to be operational from 1 January 2009.</P>

        <Quest> if he has requested the National Consumer Agency to investigate the failure of retailers to pass on savings on imported goods from the UK and the USA due to the strengthening of the euro against the pound and dollar; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Consumer Protection Act 2007 specifically provides that the National Consumer Agency shall be independent in the performance of its functions and in this regard I, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have no direct responsibility in relation to the manner in which the Agency exercises its statutory functions.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by some commentators that the benefits of recent movements in exchange rates between the Euro and Sterling and the Euro and the Dollar may not be passed on to consumers. In this regard I am advised that the National Consumer Agency has raised these concerns in bilateral discussions with retailers. In the course of those discussions, retailers have advised that the benefits of recent exchange rate movements may not be fully reflected in their prices as in many instances they are tied into long term hedging arrangements, which do not make it possible for them to respond to short-term exchange rate fluctuations. As such, it may take some time for exchange rate movements to be reflected in pricing. This is also likely to be the case for goods that are pre-labelled, often far in advance of hitting the shops.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding such considerations, I understand that the National Consumer Agency remains concerned that in some instances the price charged by retailers reflects a price level that the retailer anticipates the Irish market will bear, and this may or may not take into account movements in exchange rates. The Deputy will be aware of the various initiatives undertaken by the National Consumer Agency to raise awareness among consumers in relation to the price they pay for goods and services and particularly in relation to the importance of consumers achieving the best value for money when purchasing such goods and services. In this regard the Deputy will be aware of the specific surveys carried out by the Agency in relation to food prices, the most recent of which was published last month. I very much welcome the Agency&rsquo;s activities in this area which clearly provide consumers with necessary information regarding the prices charged by different retailers. In this regard, I note the recent statement by the Chief Executive of the Agency that following the publication of its Grocery Price Comparison Survey a significant number of consumers have already changed their shopping behaviour based on the Survey&rsquo;s results. I would urge all consumers to consult the Agency&rsquo;s surveys in order that they can make informed decisions in relation to those retailers from whom they wish to purchase goods and services.</P>
        <P>I am confident the work of the National Consumer Agency, together with the awareness of consumers themselves, will help to ensure that consumers are sufficiently informed to direct their business to those retailers offering them the best value for money and a fair deal.</P>

	<P>Workers are insured under the Social Welfare Acts as either employed or self-employed contributors. All workers, both employed and self-employed, are obliged to pay PRSI contributions as a percentage of their personal reckonable income. These contributions provide entitlement to a range of contingency-based payments under various social insurance schemes &mdash; including pensions.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers aged between 16 and 66 years and with reckonable income that exceeds the current insurable limit of &euro;3,174 per annum pay social insurance contributions at PRSI Class S. These contributions are due at 3% of reckonable income, or &euro;253, whichever is the greater.</P>
        <P>PRSI Class S contributors are entitled to the following payments: the Widow&rsquo;s or Widower&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension; the Guardian&rsquo;s Payment (Contributory); the State Pension (Contributory); Maternity Benefit; Adoptive Benefit, and; the Bereavement Grant.</P>
        <P>The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work.  This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable. Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s payments &mdash; these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</P>
        <P>There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.  Class S contributors who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments by satisfying certain conditions &mdash; including a means test.</P>

	<P>Permanent and pensionable employees in the public and civil service (including registered doctors and dentists, Garda&iacute;, commissioned army officers and members of the Army Nursing Service) who were recruited prior to 6 April, 1995 are liable for a 0.9% modified social insurance contribution on their pay under PRSI Classes B, C or D. This entitles them to the following payments &mdash; subject to them having the required number of PRSI contributions: the Widow&rsquo;s or Widower&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension; the Guardian&rsquo;s Payment (Contributory); Occupational Injuries Benefits (PRSI Classes B and D only); the Bereavement Grant, and; Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.</P>
        <P>According to the most recently published estimates, from 2005, of the number of persons in each social insurance class, a total of 119,997 contributors are liable for a 0.9% modified social insurance contribution on their pay under PRSI Classes B, C or D.</P>
        <P>The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work. This in turn determines the rate of contribution payable. Persons with earnings from Classes B, C or D employments are liable for PRSI at the lower modified insurance rate of 2.35% by the employer on top of the 0.9% payable by the employee &mdash; a total of 3.25% excluding levies. They are potentially eligible to a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A. This reduced rate of contribution reflects the fact that employments covered at the modified rate offer permanent and pensionable positions to their staff members. As such, these workers are covered by their employer for both sick-pay during illness and occupational pensions. Social insurance protection for these payments is therefore not required.</P>
        <P>The issue of social insurance coverage for public and civil servants was examined by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986. While recommending that these workers be liable for full social insurance contributions and entitled to benefits, it acknowledged that this would be a matter for discussion through normal employer/labour channels. In 1994, the Government announced that full-rate PRSI would be extended to employees in the public sector generally and that staff interests would be fully consulted. Following extensive negotiation, the revised system of coverage that was brought in with effect from April, 1995, was applicable to new recruits only.  There are no plans at present for a further review of the PRSI position of public and civil servants.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  These conditions vary between the two jobseeker schemes and involve, among other things, the need to establish the customer&rsquo;s social insurance record, establish the customer&rsquo;s identity or their place of habitual residence and to assess means where appropriate.  In some cases delays arise where customers fail to supply all pertinent information in support of their application.</P>
        <P>The processes and procedures surrounding the authorisation of claims are kept under review and where efficiencies are identified they are implemented across the network of local offices. There is also a continued emphasis on providing staff with the necessary training and development to ensure they have the requisite knowledge and skills to carry out their work.</P>
        <P>The overall performance in any individual office in processing claims can be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors; including staff vacancies and the duration of such vacancies, the turnover of staff in the office, the levels of absenteeism, maternity leave, parental level and increased inflow of claims.</P>
        <P>Details of the average processing times for applications for jobseekers benefit and jobseekers allowance at local and branch offices in respect of the full year 2007 and separately, the month of January 2008, are set out in the tabular statement.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This customer applied for Widows Non Contributory Pension on the 15th of December 2007.  Following an assessment of her means by a Social Welfare Inspector she has been awarded a reduced rate Widows Non Contributory Pension of E20.30 per week from the 4th January 2008.  Arrears of pension will issue to her shortly.  If the customer is dissatisfied with the decision she has the right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>A Social Welfare Inspector visited the person concerned in February, 2008, to establish her circumstances in the context of her application for a non-contributory widow&rsquo;s pension.  Given that she has a farm, the Inspector suggested that she also complete an application for farm assist, as her entitlement under that scheme might be greater than under the widow&rsquo;s scheme.  The Inspector assisted her in completing the application.  The Inspector is currently investigating her entitlements under both schemes. However, the claim for farm assist has not yet been formally registered.  When the Inspector&rsquo;s enquiries are completed, a decision will be made on both claims, with effect from the date of application for the widow&rsquo;s pension and the person concerned will be notified of the outcome. </P>

        <Quest> the rationale for applying the current formula used to assess entitlement to a pre-1953 State pension where credits from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement are used to satisfy the minimum number of contributions required; if his attention has been drawn to the anomalous position whereby once this minimum is reached, every extra non-Irish contribution results in a smaller payment for the applicant; the rationale for not basing the formula on the number of <Col N="158"/>Irish credits as a proportion of total credits up to 260 credits; if his attention has further been drawn to the way in which the formula differs from the full State pension; if the effect of this formula is in keeping with Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral agreements; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Where a person has social insurance contributions from another EEA country, or a country with which Ireland has a bi-lateral agreement, these can be used to qualify a person for a pension.  The manner in which contributions from EEA countries are to be used is laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and the same general principles are applied in the reciprocal agreements Ireland has with a number of other countries.  These Regulations provide that where the conditions required by the legislation of a country for entitlement to old age benefits are satisfied only after counting the contributions made in another country, the first country shall calculate the amount of pension the person would be entitled to if s/he had completed his/her full career of periods of insurance under the legislation of that country.  Then the proportional pension is calculated by multiplying the theoretical amount of pension by the ratio of periods of insurance in that State to the person&rsquo;s full career. </P>
        <P>The pre-53 pension is a special measure designed to provide a pension to people who would not otherwise qualify for any payment.  A number of such pensions are being paid in accordance with the arrangements outlined above and I am satisfied that such payments are calculated in accordance with the relevant EU regulations and the reciprocal agreements entered into by Ireland with other States.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 to 142, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="159"/>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The tenant makes the application for rent supplement and the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant in all cases.  Payment is made to the tenant, is the property of the tenant and is specifically for the benefit of the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement has over the years developed beyond the original objective of providing short-term assistance with accommodation costs.  A significant number of people have now come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods, including people on local authority housing lists.  The following table shows the average claim duration, in days, of rent supplement claims from 2003 to 2007.  This represents unbroken continuous claims only.  Where a rent supplement recipient changes address, a new tenancy is created the claim at the new address is recorded as a new claim and the duration spent at the previous address is not taken into account in these statistics.  Statistics maintained quarterly for the Rental Accommodation Scheme show that at the end of 2007 there were over 32,000 people are on rent supplement for 18 months or more at one or more addresses.  This is just over half of all rent supplement recipients.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with the local authorities.  However, under legislation introduced in October 2006 the HSE who administer the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on the department&rsquo;s behalf may refuse rent supplement where it has been notified by a housing authority that the accommodation concerned does not comply with standards.  Where a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant the Community Welfare Officer would discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant.</P>
        <P>If the landlord of that tenancy has other rented properties then it would be a matter for the housing authority to decide if an inspection of the property is required and decide whether the landlord is in compliance with housing standards.  The Community Welfare Service of the HSE is not qualified to undertake this work.  The most recent information available from the HSE is that any notifications of substandard accommodation received from local authorities have resulted in rent supplement being terminated or the refusal of rent supplement where it was not already in payment.</P>
        <P>The following table shows the total expenditure on rent supplement in 2006 and 2007 and the estimate for 2008.  I also attach a table showing the number of recipients of rent supplement at 2006, 2007 and 28 March 2008.  Almost all of these are in private landlord type accommodation.  The numbers in the voluntary housing sector are minimal as those tenancies have been transferred from rent supplement to the Local Authorities under the rental accommodation scheme.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic SWA rate, less a specified minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  This minimum contribution gives clarity to the applicant as to his or her contribution to their rent and has not been increased since January 2004, despite significant increases in basic social welfare payments.  Those who have income in addition to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate may be required to contribute more than the minimum contribution but only after significant income disregards have been allowed in respect of that additional income i.e. disregard the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for <Col N="160"/>means assessment purposes.  This ensures that those who have no additional income only pay &euro;13 while those who have additional income may be required to contribute some of that additional income towards their rent.</P>
        <P>Section 251(1) of Chapter 4 of Part 9 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 states that where a person for the purpose of obtaining or establishing entitlement to payment of any benefit for himself or herself or for any other person, is guilty of an offence where the person knowingly makes any statement or representation (whether written or verbal) which is to his or her knowledge false or misleading in any material respect, or knowingly conceals any material fact, or produces or furnishes, or causes or knowingly allows to be produced or furnished, any document or information which he or she knows to be false in material particular.</P>
        <P>Section 257 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act states that a person who is found guilty of an offence under the Act is liable on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or to both, oron conviction of an indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;13,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or to both.</P>

        <Quest> the amount of supplementary welfare allowance recouped in the years 2006 and 2007 under section 204 and Section 205 respectively of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. </Quest>

	<P>Recoupment of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) arises where, in respect of the same period, a customer has been paid SWA and is subsequently found to be entitled to another social welfare payment.  As SWA is the temporary payment, all SWA paid, which would not have been paid had the social welfare payment been in existence at the time, is recoverable under Section 204 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  All SWA paid to a customer subsequently found to be entitled to another EU Member State payment is recoverable under Section 205.</P>
        <P>This recovery is arranged by the Department at the weekly rate of the social welfare payment or the weekly rate of SWA paid whichever is the lesser.  In the case of another EU Member <Col N="161"/>State the recovery is arranged between the Health Service Executive and the Member State involved.  &euro;62.37million was recovered in 2006 under Section 204 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act and &euro;65.19 million was recovered in 2007.  Recoupments under Section 205 of the Act from other individual EU Member States are paid to the HSE and are lodged to the Department&rsquo;s account.  As these are recorded under general receipts, no specific statistics are available.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that in the context of the appreciation of the Euro against sterling whereby people who are in receipt of their pensions here from the UK are suffering a significant drop in income due to the said appreciation; if there is a way for the recipient receiving additional income to compensate for the said loss in view of the fact that they are on fixed incomes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12668/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is aware of the appreciation in the exchange rate of the Euro against Sterling and uses the conversion mechanism provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 on Social Security for Migrant Workers when assessing means deriving from payments received from EU Member States (including U.K.) which do not form part of the EMU currencies.  The exchange rates for converting Sterling and other non-EMU currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union.  Under this mechanism the conversion rate used for means testing purposes is derived from the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of a quarter.  This rate is then used in all conversions during the course of the succeeding quarter.  Alternatively the conversion rate applicable to the next succeeding quarter is used if it is more beneficial to the customer.</P>
        <P>Currently there are approximately 8,900 customers of the State Pension (Non Contributory) scheme who are also in receipt of a British Retirement Pension.  My Department does not generally review these pensioners specifically because of movements in the exchange rate.  However it is open to any pensioner who believes they may be entitled to an increase in the rate of their State Pension (Non Contributory) payment to seek to have their means reviewed.  It should be noted that changes to the value of a British pension due to currency fluctuation may well be offset by annual increases to the rate of British pension that have yet to be included in the assessment and consequently the customer&rsquo;s State Pension (Non Contributory) payment may be unchanged or reduced as a result of  a review.</P>

	<P>Last February, I launched the National Awareness Campaign on Drugs, &ldquo;The Party&rsquo;s Over&rdquo;.  This campaign was developed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in consultation with many of the key Departments and Agencies involved in tackling problem drug use, including my own Department.  The campaign was developed with the intention that it will be sustainable over the next three years.  In the first phase, the primary aim is to communicate the dangers of cocaine use, with a particular focus on so called &ldquo;recreational cocaine users&rdquo; in the 15-34 age group.  </P>
        <P>The campaign is utilising appropriate media, such as social network websites, billboard and bus advertising as well as radio advertising to target this age group, and this approach will be continued.  The Health Promotion Unit of the HSE has also published two leaflets &ldquo;Know The Facts About Drugs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cocaine: The Facts&rdquo; to accompany the campaign.  A drugs information website www.drugs.ie has also been developed and launched in conjunction with the campaign.  In this context, it is worth noting that many of the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces already have in place a number of valuable initiatives, including events such as Awareness Weeks.  Such initiatives have proven to be effective as many of them focus on issues that are particular to their localities.</P>
        <P>In addition, it should be noted that I have secured funding this year for initiatives to tackle the cocaine problem.  As part of this, cocaine awareness campaigns at a more local and regional level &mdash; to dovetail with this national campaign &mdash; will be developed over the coming months by the Drugs Task Forces.</P>

In addition to the support provided by the CL&Aacute;R and RAPID Programmes to tackle deprivation and isolation, the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013 contains a range of other programmes and schemes implemented by my Department to address these concerns in rural and urban settings.</P><Col N="166"/>
        <P>In relation to rural matters, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the Rural Social Scheme, the CL&Aacute;R Programme, the Rural Development Programme and schemes in support of Gaeltacht areas and Islands, in addition to evolving schemes for countryside recreation and pursuits, all operated by my Department and detailed on the website <i>www.pobail.ie</i> in addition to a number of new initiatives such as the night-time rural transport scheme.</P>
        <P>A number of programmes have both an urban and rural remit to deal with a broad range of issues affecting people, be they caused by economic or social deprivation or isolation.  I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to my Department&rsquo;s website where details of the Local Development Social Inclusion, the Community Development, the Community Services, and the RAPID Programmes are set out.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, addressing anti social behaviour is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  My Department does, however, operate a number of grant schemes and programmes, such as the RAPID Programme and the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, which specifically support local communities address social and economic disadvantage, including the issue of anti-social behaviour. </P>
        <P>Details of all the programmes and schemes operated by my Department, including eligibility criteria can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.pobail.ie</i>  It should be noted, however, that each of the schemes and programmes operated by my Department are governed by rules and regulations, which projects must meet in order to qualify for funding.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to question 232 of 20th February 2008.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, in many rural areas, there are no public transport services at night. While there are, in the more developed rural areas, either hackney or taxi services, these are at the discretion of the providers of these services and do not provide a guaranteed service to rural people.</P>
        <P>It was against this background, therefore, that in May 2007 I introduced a new evening transport service, on a pilot basis, to allow rural people to fully participate in the various activities &mdash; community, sporting and social &mdash; that take place in their areas.  Funding of &euro;500,000 was pledged for the one-year pilot, and to date &euro;125,000 has been expended by my Department on this particular project. Thirty-four groups currently deliver the Rural Transport Programme, which is operated by the Department of Transport.</P><Col N="167"/>
        <P>My intention is that the pilot Scheme will be reviewed after a year and decisions in relation to its future will be informed by the outcome of the evaluation.  Assistance is also available, through this Department, for the purchase of vehicles to provide a mini bus service on the Islands, for the purposes of providing community transport.</P>

	<P>To dovetail with the HSE&rsquo;s National Drugs Awareness Campaign &ldquo;The Party&rsquo;s Over&rdquo;, I recently announced funding for cocaine awareness campaigns at a local and regional level. These campaigns will be delivered through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces who, through their interaction with communities and groups on the ground, are I believe, best placed to deliver meaningful, appropriate and focussed campaigns.   </P>
        <P>In addition, many of the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces already have in place a number of valuable initiatives, including events such as &ldquo;Awareness Weeks&rdquo;.  Such initiatives have proven to be effective as many of them focus on the issues particular to their localities.  It is open to community and voluntary groups to approach the Drugs Task Force for their area with regard to particular funding proposals they might have.   The South Western Regional Drugs Task Force covers Co. Kildare and their offices are located in Block A, Maudlins Hall, Dublin Road, Naas, Co. Kildare.</P>

	<P>Mayo County Council applied for a licence under the Foreshore Acts to construct a temporary bridge at Achill Sound in March 06.  A licence to facilitate the construction of the temporary bridge was granted to the Council in October 2006.  The licence included specific conditions relating to the methodology to be employed in the construction of the bridge.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently received complaints in relation to the construction of the bridge and these complaints have been referred to our Engineering Division for investigation.  The complaints have also been referred to the Council.  The Council has indicated that the fill being used in the construction works is from a local source and is fit for purpose.  A foreshore lease to facilitate construction of the permanent bridge is also being processed by my Department.   This lease will also contain specific conditions regarding construction methodology and environmental protection</P>
        <P>My Department is in close contact with the Council to ensure that all the conditions of the foreshore licence issued are being complied with.  My Department would regard with utmost seriousness any breaches of the conditions of the foreshore licence issued.</P>

	<P>The Glasha embankments near Cromane Lower were the responsibility of The Land Commissioners until the implementation of the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992.  My Department has, however, agreed to provide funding for the development of the pier at Cromane and agreement was reached between Kerry County Council and my Department&rsquo;s Engineering Division that should the dredging section of the Cromane Main Development Project proceed in 2007, my Departments Engineering Division would consider using the waste material from the dredging to secure the embankments.</P>
        <P>Kerry County Council are involved in the securing of a compulsory purchase order in order to progress the project, but unfortunately were unable to secure the necessary compulsory purchase order in 2007 and the Cromane project failed to progress in that year.  &euro;750,000 has been allocated by my Department to this project in 2008 and Kerry County Council are hopeful of securing the necessary compulsory purchase order this year which will enable works to proceed. Subject to satisfactory progress being made by Kerry County Council, consideration can be then given to stabilising the embankments in 2008.</P>

	<P>Regulation of developments and activities on the foreshore, which is defined as the area of seabed between the mean high watermark and the 12 nautical mile limit (22.2 km) is subject to the Foreshore Act 1933.  The development of an offshore windfarm on the foreshore requires a consent under this Act.  The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 for all energy developments on the foreshore would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the context of progressing the various elements required to develop the appropriate coastal zone legislative framework for all activities on the foreshore, including offshore wind farms.</P>

	<P>Three applications were received in May 2007 requesting the transfer of entitlements from the person named to three other farmers by way of sale under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme year. </P>
        <P>Since no relevant supporting documentation was received with the original applications and as two of the requested transfers involved sales with land, it was necessary for my Department to request copies of Sale Agreements.  In addition, as one of the transferees was claiming New Entrant status, supporting documentation in relation to this claim was also requested.  This documentation was duly received.</P>
        <P>An issue relating to the Single Payment entitlement account of one of the proposed transferees has delayed the processing of these transfers. This issue has since been resolved and the requested transfers will be processed as soon as possible.  Once the requested transfers have been completed, the person named will have 39.40 entitlements remaining in his account. As he has declared 36.38 hectares on his 2007 Single Payment application, he will receive payment on 36.38 entitlements.</P>

	<P>The schools referred to by the Deputy are two of four schools that make up the First Bundle of the Department&rsquo;s current Public Private Partnership Programme.</P>
        <P>This bundle consists of two new schools in Portlaoise, Co. Laois and two new schools in Co. Offaly. The two schools in Portlaoise will be built on the one site &mdash; St. Mary&rsquo;s CBS, and Scoil Chr&iacute;ost R&iacute; and the two schools in Co. Offaly comprise a new community school and a new community college.</P>
        <P>Macquarie Partnership for Ireland (MPFI) were selected as the preferred tenderer for the provision of this Bundle in October 2007. Negotiations between the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), who are responsible for the procurement of the schools, and MPFI have been ongoing since that date are now well advanced. Until these negotiations are complete and the formal contract signed it will not be possible to provide a final date for the completion of construction for these schools.</P>
        <P>At this point in the negotiations I can inform the Deputy that assuming a successful conclusion to these negotiations MPFI will be in a position to submit planning applications for all four schools to the relevant local authorities, and the contract will be ready for signing on receipt of planning permission. Subject to the outcome of the planning process with the relevant authorities, construction of the four schools is expected to start in the summer and it is anticipated that they will be available before the end of 2009.</P>

	<P>As already stated in my reply dated 30th January, 2008 the Department plans to provide a new primary school for the Aston Village area of Drogheda next September.  An application in respect of this new school has been made to the New Schools Advisory Committee (NSAC) by a recognised Patron. The New Schools Advisory Committee is an independent body and therefore I am not in a position <Col N="177"/>to comment on their deliberations. I expect to be in a position to make an announcement when the NSAC makes recommendations to me later this month.</P>

	<P>The Higher Education Grants Schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  Under the Higher Education Grants Scheme an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.</P>
        <P>An approved institution is defined to mean a university, college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course, or courses, which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
        <P>Each year, the Higher Education Grants Scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the Schemes. The approved institutions mainly comprise public funded third level institutions.</P>
        <P>I understand the course referred to by the Deputy is provided by a private college. There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes to private colleges.</P>

	<P>The specific information sought by the Deputy is not readily available within my Department and would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.  My Department has recently published a Data Strategy covering the period 2008 to 2010. The Strategy outlines a number of goals and actions to improve the quality and supply of data over the coming three-year period within the resources available to the Department and associated agencies. Included among these will be the development of a Learner Database to encompass all pupils at primary level.</P>
        <P>My Department estimates that there are in the region of 21,000 pupils in our primary schools whose first language is not English or Irish. The language support needs of these children are being met by over 1,500 language support teachers.</P>
        <P>In order to meet their language needs, my Department in May 2007 issued a circular, reference 0053/2007, to the managerial authorities of all schools &mdash; both primary and post primary &mdash; to assist them in providing an inclusive school environment to meet the needs of pupils for whom English is a second language. The circular outlines the resources that are available to assist schools in this task. The circular is accessible on the website of my Department.</P>
        <P>The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled. An individual school may be allocated up to six language support posts under the arrangements now in place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As you may be aware, a recently established Developing Areas Unit, within the School Planning and Building Unit of my Department is working on providing educational facilities in rapidly developing areas, including Dublin 15.</P>
        <P>The projects to which the Deputy refers are at various stages of early architectural planning and submissions made to the Department are awaiting approval by the Department&rsquo;s technical staff. All of these projects are being considered in the context of the work of the Developing Areas Unit and will be progressed in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation programme.</P><Col N="179"/>
        <P>As the various submissions are cleared by the technical staff of the Department the Developing Areas Unit will correspond directly with the school authorities as to further progression.</P>
        <P>I will forward details on the specific status of each project directly to the Deputy&rsquo;s office.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Leo Varadkar</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> the breakdown for each university of all degrees awarded for each of the past five years by degree class; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12624/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following tables.  There is an issue with reporting and calendar years. The 2002 tables are from the old paper returns, and relate to the 2002 calendar year only. Subsequent years moved to academic calendar years when counting graduates so the 2003 file refers to the 03/04 academic year. The latest data is for 05/06, since graduates are counted one year in arrears in March of each year; the 06/07 data won&rsquo;t be available until June at the earliest.</P>
        <P>For degree graduates, tables breaking down awards by discipline, university, and class of award are as follows.  Each sheet within each file presents data on full- and part-time graduates separately. Also following is data on masters graduates and PhD graduates.  These are broken down by institution and discipline only, with mode of study combined into one table.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Class size data for primary schools for 2007/2008 are currently being compiled by my Department and are not yet available. The source of this data is the Annual Census of Primary Schools. Data will become available when returns for all schools have been processed.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.</P>
        <P>Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children. Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 350 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.</P><Col N="238"/>
        <P>This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that during 2006/07 my Department, through NEPS, funded some 4,416 psychological assessments under the SCPA. In this period NEPS psychologists undertook casework in respect of some 8,183 named pupils, including cases under the Reasonable Accommodation for Certificate Examinations (RACE) scheme on behalf of the State Examinations Commission. In addition, it is estimated that NEPS psychologists gave consultations, advice and assistance to teachers and school authorities in respect of an additional 5,000 unnamed pupils, although this figure is not disaggregated by level of school.</P>
        <P>Since May 2007, the number of psychologists employed within the NEPS service has increased from 128 to 138 and during 2008 this complement will increase to 169. In this regard, following a national recruitment process put in place in late 2007 by the Public Appointments Service, interviews in this regard have recently been completed and regional panels are currently being formed from which recruits will be drawn for appointment to priority regions, some 20 panellists have recently been offered postings and are in negotiation in relation to placement.</P>
        <P>As I have previously stated, and in line with Government commitments under the T2016 Agreement, it is further my intention to increase NEPS psychologist personnel to 200 during 2009.</P>
        <P>On the legislative front, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 provides for an educational assessment for children with special educational needs and the entitlement to an education plan to meet those needs. As the Deputy will also be aware, many sections of the Act have already commenced and I am anxious to implement the Act in full in the quickest time possible. However, following consideration of the issues raised in the National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s implementation plan, and the consultations to date with the Education Partners, I consider that the five year timeframe acknowledged in the legislation is the appropriate period in which to implement the remaining provisions of the Act.</P>

The system is intended to cater for children with high-incidence special education needs such as borderline mild general learning disability and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. The allocation is also intended to support those with learning support needs. This ensures that resources are permanently in place in schools to provide supports for individual children.</P>
        <P>The system allows schools to use their professional judgement in responding quickly and effectively to the individual needs of children with special educational needs. The system facilitates flexibility in the delivery of interventions by schools in allowing for individualised tuition, group work, in-class support or a combination of these interventions, whichever is considered the most appropriate for the child in question.</P><Col N="239"/>
        <P>This capacity to use the General Allocation Model to meet the individual needs of pupils will continue when the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act is implemented.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 195 together.</P>
        <P>In 2007 my Department held a competition to recruit Temporary Clerical Officers for assignment to the Department&rsquo;s offices in Athlone and Tullamore and to the State Examinations Commission in Athlone. The competition was advertised in local press in the midlands area and on a local radio station. The cost of advertising for the competition in 2007 was &euro;9,862.14.  There was no cost for recruitment advertising for my Department in 2006.</P>

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.</P>
        <P>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 18 July 2000 and applied for asylum. His application was refused and a Deportation Order was signed in respect of him on 25 January 2005. Judicial Review proceedings challenging the Deportation Order were instituted on 31 March 2005.</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 (&lsquo;The <Col N="244"/>Regulations&rsquo;) on 26 November 2006. He was informed on 28 November 2006 that his application was invalid as the Deportation Order had been made in respect of him prior to the coming into force of the Regulation on 10 October 2006. Judicial Review proceedings challenging this decision were instituted on 8 December 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These Judicial Review proceedings were settled following the Judgment of Mr. Justice Feeney in the cases of Hila &amp; Djolo, where he determined that under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility  for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 that the Minister has discretion to accept and consider applications for Subsidiary Protection from persons who do not have an automatic right to apply but who have identified new facts or circumstances which demonstrate a change of position from that which pertained at the time the Deportation Order was made.</P>
        <P>Subsequently the person concerning submitted an application pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 on 23 November 2007, requesting that I exercise discretion to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection. Following a consideration of the material submitted it was concluded that the applicant had established no grounds which would enable me to exercise discretion under Regulation 4(2). The person concerned was notified of my decision on 18 March 2008.  The Judicial Review proceedings challenging the Deportation Order are still ongoing and as the matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 24 April 2005 with her three children and claimed asylum. Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was informed by letter dated 21 March, 2006 that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her dependants and afforded her three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of Deportation Orders or to submit, within 15 days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her dependants should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why they should not be deported.</P>
        <P>An application for Subsidiary Protection was received in my Department on 5 April 2007 in respect of the person concerned and her dependants.  Following consideration of the application, a decision was reached that they were ineligible for Subsidiary Protection and their case would proceed for consideration under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended.</P>
        <P>Their case was subsequently examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on their behalf for permission to remain in the State.  On 26 February 2008 I refused permission to remain in the State and instead signed Deportation Orders in respect of them.  Notice of these Orders was served by registered post requiring the person concerned and her dependants to present themselves at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 27 March <Col N="245"/>2008 in order to make travel arrangements for their removal from the State.  The person concerned presented as required and is due to present again on 29 April 2008.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Deportation Orders is that the person concerned and her dependants must leave the State and remain thereafter out of it.  The enforcement of the Deportation Orders remains an operational matter for the Bureau.</P>

	<P>The persons concerned applied for asylum in the State on 20th January 2005. Their applications were refused and deportation orders were made in respect of them on 23 November 2005. The applicants instituted judicial review proceedings on 13 January 2006 challenging the decision to make deportation orders in respect of them. The proceedings were determined on 30 January 2008 <Col N="247"/>when the reliefs sought were refused by the High Court. The applicants were refused a certificate to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court on 13 March 2008.</P>
        <P>The persons in question submitted applications for subsidiary protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. 518 of the 2006 (&rsquo;the Regulations&rsquo;) on 3 March 2008. These applicants are persons in respect of whom deportation orders were signed before the coming into force of the Regulations on 10 October 2006, and as such are not automatically entitled to apply for Subsidiary Protection under the Regulations.  In situations where an individual does not have an automatic right to apply for subsidiary protection but has identified new facts or circumstances which demonstrate a change of position from that which pertained at the time the deportation orders were made, I may exercise discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of the information submitted by the applicants, it was concluded that they have established no grounds to show that there are new or altered circumstances from the time the deportation orders were made. The applicants were informed by letter dated 19 March 2008 that I had decided not to exercise discretion pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. 518 of the 2006 to accept and consider applications for subsidiary protection from them. The applicants instituted judicial proceedings on 20 March 2008 challenging that decision. As the matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.</P>

	<P>Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the <Col N="248"/>third quarter of 2006.

	<P>The first named person concerned arrived in the State on 15 December 2002 accompanied by two of her children and made an application for asylum.  Their application was refused following consideration of their case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the first named person concerned was informed, by letter dated 28 April 2004, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of her and her children.  They were given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of deportation orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been received on behalf of the first named person concerned and her children.</P>
        <P>Legal Representatives for the first named person concerned contacted the Department inquiring if their client was eligible to apply for Subsidiary Protection under the regulations known as the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006), which came into force on 10 October 2006.  My Department issued a letter dated 18 March 2008 advising them that their client was eligible to apply for Subsidiary Protection. In addition, they were informed that they had 10 working days in which to submit the application. There has been no response to date; however, the Deputy should note that the 10-day period has only just expired.  The case file of the person concerned, including all representations <Col N="251"/>submitted, will be carefully considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, in advance of the file being passed to me for decision.</P>
        <P>With regard to the second named person concerned, as the Deputy will be aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. It is not the practice to comment in detail on individual asylum applications.  A final decision on this application will be made upon receipt of the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 10 October 2001 and claimed asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was informed by letter dated 12 March, 2003 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and afforded him three options in <Col N="252"/>accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended): namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e why he should not be deported.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf for permission to remain in the State. On 12 July 2004 my predecessor refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on Thursday 27 January 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State. He presented as required and was given further presentation dates which he kept. He is due to present again on 29 April 2008.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Deportation Order is that person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Bureau.</P>

        <P>While it is not the practice to comment in detail on individual asylum applications, I would point out to the Deputy that delays in finalising cases can occur for a variety of reasons, including giving applicants and appellants the fullest opportunity possible to present their cases and the determination of Judicial Review proceedings, where appellants pursue such a course of action.  Where the latter is relevant, the time taken to discharge any proceedings is a matter for the Courts and is not something that I, as Minister, can comment on. It is, of course, open to the applicants or the appellants to withdraw any Judicial Review proceedings which they may have instigated and this would allow for their appeal to be processed in the normal manner.</P>

        <P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation from the persons referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question were received in the Citizenship section of my Department in May 2005.  The files were forwarded to my predecessor in May 2007 and he decided to refuse the applications. Letters informing them of this were issued, via their solicitors, in May 2007. Further applications for certificates of naturalisation from the persons in question were received in August 2007.  Officials in that section are currently processing applications received in August 2005 and have approximately 13,700 applications on hand to be dealt with before those of the persons concerned. These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  However, as the applicants are refugees and the Government has obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that such applications are dealt with as quickly as possible, having regard to the general volume of applications on hand. It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the applications will commence in the first half of 2009.</P>

        <P>Their case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on their behalf for permission to remain in the State. On 21 January 2005 my predecessor refused permission to remain in the State and instead signed Deportation Orders in respect of them. Notice of these Orders was served by registered post requiring the person concerned and her son to present themselves at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 24 February 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for their removal from the State.  An application for Subsidiary <Col N="256"/>Protection on behalf of the person concerned and her son was received in my Department on 20 November 2006. Same was deemed ineligible at the time and refused. This decision was made known to the legal representatives of the person concerned by letter dated 1 December 2006. On 15 December 2006, the person concerned initiated Judicial Review Proceedings concerning the refusal of her Subsidiary Protection application.</P>
        <P>Subsequently on 5 November 2007, a letter was sent to the legal representatives of the person concerned inviting them to make representations on behalf of their clients regarding any new facts or circumstances relevant to the person concerned which had arisen since the Deportation Orders were signed which may provide a possible entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection. An application was then made on behalf of the person concerned seeking the exercise of the Minister&rsquo;s discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006, S.I. No.518 of 2006 to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection. In the meantime, Judicial Review Proceedings initiated by the person concerned were struck out on 3 March 2008.</P>
        <P>The application, seeking the exercise of the Minister&rsquo;s discretion, referred to above was refused and the person concerned was notified by letter dated 13 March 2008 that following consideration of her application, there were no grounds in existence under which the Minister could exercise his discretion under Regulation 4 (2) to accept and consider her Subsidiary Protection application. In addition, she was advised that the GNIB had been requested to proceed with the enforcement of her Deportation Order. She was further advised to present herself and her son at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 27 March 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for their removal from the State. She presented as required and is due to present again on 29 April 2008.  The effect of the Deportation Orders is that the person concerned and her son must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Orders remains an operational matter for the Bureau.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 250 together.</P>
        <P>The Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines for Planning Authorities were published in April 2005, and have a statutory basis as they were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The Guidelines are designed to achieve a balance between a good planning framework for rural housing and the local housing needs of those who are part of, or have links to, local rural communities.</P>
        <P>In a circular letter issued in May 2005, planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la were asked to put in place the required procedures and practices to implement the policies set out in the Guidelines as quickly and effectively as possible.  My Department also held two seminars for local authority planning officials on the implementation of the Guidelines.  While respecting <Col N="262"/>the need to consider each planning application individually and on its own merits, planning officials were asked to ensure that the provisions of the Guidelines are applied consistently and uniformly.</P>
        <P>All planning authorities were also requested to take immediate steps to review their development plans so as to incorporate any changes necessary to promote consistency with the policies set out in the Guidelines.  This has been done, with some authorities varying their plans and others incorporating the Guidelines into the reviews of development plans.</P>
        <P>The Guidelines are a material consideration both in relation to development plans and in the consideration of planning applications.  Detailed application to particular planning cases is, however, a matter for the planning authority concerned or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate.  My Department will continue to monitor implementation of sustainable rural planning policies to ensure appropriate consistency in the application of guidance across all counties.</P>

	<P>A number of different statutory processes are involved in appointments to State boards and bodies under the aegis of my Department. In some cases statutory selection procedures must be followed or nominations must be sought from independent nominating panels before appointments are made by the Government or by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In other cases only particular public office holders may be appointed to certain boards and bodies. In a number of situations, only some appointments to the body or board concerned are made by the Minister.</P>

Issues to be considered will include the establishment of town councils in those towns that have shown significant population growth in recent years. The White Paper will address the timing of any new reforms.</P>
        <P>The provisions for the establishment of new town councils are contained in Part 17 of the Local Government Act 2001. However, these provisions have not been commenced and in these circumstances formal moves to establish a new town council cannot proceed. I will give consideration to those parts of the 2001 Act which have not yet been commenced as part of the reform process.</P>

	<P>A pilot phase of the scheme in question was completed in 2007. The local authority sought approval in March 2007 to extend the pilot phase using the existing contractor. For reasons of public procurement the Department was not able to accede to this request. In the context of the overall Master Plan for the estate the Department also asked the authority to advance the provision of new housing as a means of allowing the refurbishment of the existing houses to proceed in larger phases. It is a matter for the housing authority to submit revised proposals to my Department to enable the project to proceed and I understand the Council will be making a submission in this regard in the near future. </P>

	<P>Department of Finance Circular 44 of 2006 (Tax Clearance Procedures Grants, Subsidies and Similar Type Payments) sets down revised procedures to be followed in the operation of the tax clearance scheme for applicants for all grants from State and public sector bodies.</P><Col N="267"/>
        <P>The Circular provides that, in the case of a grant application totalling &euro;10,000 or more, all applicants are required to produce a valid Tax Clearance Certificate.  The provisions of the Circular apply in respect of all grant applications received after 1 January 2007 and were, therefore, applicable prior to the implementation, in November 2007, of the revised Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability.</P>

	<P>Donadea Forest Park, which is a proposed Natural Heritage Area, is owned and operated by Coillte Teoranta and its development is a matter for that body in the first instance.</P>
        <P>My Department has been in touch with Coillte Teoranta and I understand that they have no plans for development of Donadea Forest Park. In the event that proposals are drawn up to develop the Park, Castle and Structures, my Department will be consulted on the matter.</P>
        <P>In so far as the restoration of the Castle and structures are concerned, a number of conservation grant schemes are in operation for the restoration and conservation of buildings of significant architectural heritage merit including schemes operated by my Department and the Heritage Council. No specific grant application to fund such works at the Forest Park has been made.</P>

	<P>A paper on Next Generation Broadband (NGB) is being finalised in my Department and will be published shortly for public consultation.  The objective of the Paper is to set out a strong framework for the development of NGB in Ireland including addressing the optimum role for Government both in terms of formulating and development by the private sector and targeted direct investment.</P>
        <P>I established an expert International Advisory Forum on Next Generation Broadband that met on 26 and 27 February 2008 to critically evaluate the policy issues, options and recommendations contained, as indicated in the draft of the paper.</P>
        <P>The draft paper is now being amended to take account of the Forum&rsquo;s views and, as already indicated, I will publish the paper for public consultation.</P>
        <P>The Value for Money and Policy Review (VFMPR) of Phase I of the MANs Programme is being finalised and is due to be published shortly.  Both the VFMPR and the policy paper on Next Generation Broadband will guide the further development of policy in this important area.</P>

	<P>The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broad<Col N="270"/>band coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</P>
        <P>Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved, including any unserved areas in County Wexford, and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the NBS procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete, and it is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008 and that implementation of services will commence as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
